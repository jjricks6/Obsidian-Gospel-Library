 In the Old Testament, the Moabite daughter-in-law of Naomi and Elimelech, who were Israelites. After the death of her husband, Ruth married Naomi's kinsman Boaz. Their son Obed was the ancestor of David and Christ. The story of Ruth beautifully illustrates the conversion of a non-Israelite into the fold of Israel. Ruth gave up her former god and former life to unite with the household of faith in serving the God of Israel ([[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 1#^verse-16|Ruth 1:16]]).

## The book of Ruth

 [[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 1|Chapter 1]] describes the life of Elimelech and his family in Moab. After the deaths of their husbands, Naomi and Ruth went to Bethlehem.

[[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 3|Chapter 3]] tells how Naomi instructed Ruth to go to the threshing floor and lie at the feet of Boaz. [[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 4|Chapter 4]] is the story of Ruth's marriage to Boaz. They had a son, Obed, through whose lineage David and Christ came.
