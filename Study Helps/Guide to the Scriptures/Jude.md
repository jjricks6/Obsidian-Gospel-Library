## The epistle of Jude

 This book consists of a letter from Jude to certain Saints who were weakening in the faith. They were being weakened by those among them who professed to be Christians but who were practicing immoral pagan worship and claiming to be exempt from obeying the moral law. Jude wished to awaken the Saints to a sense of their spiritual danger and to encourage them to remain faithful.

 Some notable passages in Jude are [[New Testament/Jude#^verse-6|verse 6]], which recounts the war in heaven and the casting out of Lucifer and his angels from that premortal state ([[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 3#^verse-26|Abr. 3:26-28]]), and [[New Testament/Jude#^verse-14|verses 14-15]], which cite a prophecy made by Enoch.
