 In the Old Testament, the oldest son of Asenath and Joseph who was sold into Egypt ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 41#^verse-50|Gen. 41:50-51]]). He and his brother Ephraim were grandsons of Jacob (Israel) but were adopted and blessed by him as if they were his own sons ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 48#^verse-1|Gen. 48:1-20]]).

## The tribe of Manasseh

 Manasseh's descendants were numbered among the tribes of Israel ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1#^verse-34|Num. 1:34-35]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 13#^verse-29|Josh. 13:29-31]]). Moses' blessing of the tribe of Joseph, which was given also to Ephraim and Manasseh, is recorded in [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-13|Deuteronomy 33:13-17]]. Their assigned land was partly west of the Jordan and next to Ephraim's. They also had colonies east of the Jordan in the rich pastureland of Bashan and Gilead. In the last days, the tribe of Manasseh will assist the tribe of Ephraim in gathering scattered Israel ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-13|Deut. 33:13-17]]). The Book of Mormon prophet Lehi was a descendant of Manasseh ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 10#^verse-3|Alma 10:3]]).
