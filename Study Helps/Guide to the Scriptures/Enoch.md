 A prophet who led the people of the city of Zion. His ministry is discussed in both the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price. He was the seventh patriarch after Adam. He was the son of Jared and the father of Methuselah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5#^verse-18|Gen. 5:18-24]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-37|Luke 3:37]]).

 Enoch was a great person and had a more significant ministry than the Bible's brief account of him indicates. The Bible notes that he was translated ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-5|Heb. 11:5]]) but gives no details of his ministry. [[New Testament/Jude#^verse-14|Jude 1:14]] contains a quotation of a prophecy he made. Latter-day revelation explains much more of Enoch, specifically of his preaching, his city called Zion, his visions, and his prophecies ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-48|D&C 107:48-57]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6|Moses 6-7]]). Zion was taken to heaven because of the righteousness of those who lived in it ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-69|Moses 7:69]]).

 God revealed himself to Enoch, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-26|Moses 6:26-37]].

 Enoch taught the gospel, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-37|Moses 6:37-68]].

 Enoch taught the people and established Zion, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-1|Moses 7:1-21]].

 Enoch saw all things, even unto the end of the world, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-23|Moses 7:23-68]].
