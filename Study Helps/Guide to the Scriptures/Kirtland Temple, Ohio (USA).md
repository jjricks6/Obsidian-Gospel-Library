 The first temple built by the Church in modern times. The Saints built it in Kirtland, according to the Lord's command ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 94#^verse-3|D&C 94:3-9]]). One purpose was to provide a place where worthy Church members could receive spiritual power, authority, and enlightenment ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 109|D&C 109-110]]). It was dedicated on March 27, 1836; the dedicatory prayer was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith by revelation ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 109|D&C 109]]). The Lord gave several important revelations and restored needed priesthood keys in this temple ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110|D&C 110]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 137|137]]). It was not used for the full temple ordinances given in temples today.
