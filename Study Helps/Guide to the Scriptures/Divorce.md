 The termination of a marriage through the power of civil or ecclesiastical law. According to the New Testament, God permitted divorce under some conditions because of the hardness of the people's hearts; however, as Jesus explained, "from the beginning it was not so" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 19#^verse-3|Matt. 19:3-12]]). The scriptures counsel against divorce generally and advise husbands and wives to love each other in righteousness ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 7#^verse-10|1 Cor. 7:10-12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 42#^verse-22|D&C 42:22]]).
