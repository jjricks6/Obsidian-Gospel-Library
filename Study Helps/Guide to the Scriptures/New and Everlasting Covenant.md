 The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 66#^verse-2|D&C 66:2]]). It is new every time it is revealed anew following a period of apostasy. It is everlasting in the sense that it is God's covenant and has been enjoyed in every gospel dispensation where people have been willing to receive it. The new and everlasting covenant was revealed again to men on earth by Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It contains sacred ordinances administered by priesthood authority—such as baptism and temple marriage—that provide for man's salvation, immortality, and eternal life. When people accept the gospel and promise to keep God's commandments, God covenants to give them the blessings of His new and everlasting covenant.
