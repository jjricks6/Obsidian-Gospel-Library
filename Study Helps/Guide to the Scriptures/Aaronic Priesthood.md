 The lesser priesthood ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 7#^verse-11|Heb. 7:11-12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-13|D&C 107:13-14]]). Its offices are bishop, priest, teacher, and deacon ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-30|D&C 84:30]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-10|107:10, 14-15, 87-88]]). Anciently, under the law of Moses, there were high priests, priests, and Levites. Because the ancient Israelites rebelled against God, Moses and the holy priesthood were taken from them and the lesser priesthood continued. They had refused to be sanctified and receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and its ordinances. (See [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-23|D&C 84:23-26]].) The Aaronic Priesthood deals with the temporal and outward ordinances of the law and the gospel ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 23#^verse-27|1 Chr. 23:27-32]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-26|D&C 84:26-27]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-20|107:20]]). It holds the keys of the ministering of angels, of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 13|D&C 13]]).

John the Baptist conferred it on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery near Harmony, Pennsylvania ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 13|D&C 13]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-68|JS—H 1:68-73]]).
