 While Paul was temporarily free from Roman imprisonment, he wrote the epistle to Titus, who was in Crete. The letter mainly addresses questions relating to the internal discipline and organization of the Church.

 [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 1|Chapter 1]] contains Paul's greeting as well as instructions and general qualifications for bishops. [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 2|Chapters 2-3]] contain general teachings and personal messages to Titus about the treatment of various groups in the Cretan Church. Paul encouraged the Saints to overcome perversity, be sober and faithful, and maintain good works.
