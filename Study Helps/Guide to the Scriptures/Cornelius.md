 A centurion at Caesarea, baptized by Peter ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10|Acts 10]]). He was probably the first Gentile to join the Church without first having been converted to Judaism. The baptism of Cornelius and his family marked the opening of the way for the gospel to be preached to the Gentiles. Peter, the chief Apostle, who held the keys of the kingdom of God on the earth at that time, directed this preaching.
