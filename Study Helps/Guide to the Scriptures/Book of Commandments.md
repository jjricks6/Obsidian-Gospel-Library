 In 1833, a number of the revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith were prepared for publication under the title A Book of Commandments for the Government of the Church of Christ. The Lord continued to communicate with His servants, and an enlarged compilation of revelations was published two years later as the Doctrine and Covenants.

 D&C 1 is the Lord's preface to the book of his commandments, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 1#^verse-6|D&C 1:6]].

 The Lord challenged the wisest person to duplicate the least of his revelations in the Book of Commandments, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 67#^verse-4|D&C 67:4-9]].

 Stewards were appointed to publish the revelations, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 70#^verse-1|D&C 70:1-5]].
