 In the Book of Mormon, four sons of King Mosiah who were converted after an angel appeared to them and called them to repentance. Their names were Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 27#^verse-34|Mosiah 27:34]]). They spent fourteen years successfully preaching the gospel to the Lamanites. A record of their ministry among the Lamanites is given in the [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 17|book of Alma, chapters 17 to 26]].

 Earlier they were unbelievers who tried to destroy the Church, [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 27#^verse-8|Mosiah 27:8-10]] ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 36#^verse-6|Alma 36:6]]).

 They were rebuked by an angel and repented, [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 27#^verse-11|Mosiah 27:11-12, 18-20]].

 They obtained permission to preach to the Lamanites, [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 28#^verse-1|Mosiah 28:1-7]].
