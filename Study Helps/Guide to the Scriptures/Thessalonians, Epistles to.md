 Two books in the New Testament. They were originally letters that Paul wrote to the Thessalonians while he was in Corinth during his first visit to Europe around A.D. 50. His work in Thessalonica is described in [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17|Acts 17]]. Paul wanted to return to Thessalonica but was unable to do so ([[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 2#^verse-18|1 Thes. 2:18]]). He therefore sent Timothy to cheer the converts and bring him word of how they were doing. Paul wrote the first epistle as a result of his thankfulness on Timothy's return.

## First Thessalonians

 [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 1|Chapters 1-2]] contain Paul's greeting and his prayer for the Saints; [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 3|chapters 3-5]] give instruction on spiritual growth, love, chastity, diligence, and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

## Second Thessalonians

 [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 1|Chapter 1]] contains a prayer for the Saints. [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 2|Chapter 2]] speaks of the coming apostasy. [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 3|Chapter 3]] contains Paul's prayer for the triumph of the gospel cause.
