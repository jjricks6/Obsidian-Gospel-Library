 A record tracing the line of descent in a family. Where priesthood offices or certain blessings were restricted to a particular family, genealogies in the scriptures were very important ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5|Gen. 5]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10|10]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 25|25]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 46|46]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 1|1 Chr. 1-9]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 2#^verse-61|Ezra 2:61-62]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 7#^verse-63|Neh. 7:63-64]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 1#^verse-1|Matt. 1:1-17]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-23|Luke 3:23-38]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 3#^verse-1|1 Ne. 3:1-4]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5#^verse-14|5:14-19]]; [[Book of Mormon/Jarom#^verse-1|Jarom 1:1-2]]). In the restored Church today, members of the Church continue to trace their family lines of descent, in part to properly identify deceased ancestors so they can perform saving ordinances in their ancestors' behalf. These ordinances are valid for those deceased persons who accept the gospel of Jesus Christ in the spirit world ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 127|D&C 127-128]]).
