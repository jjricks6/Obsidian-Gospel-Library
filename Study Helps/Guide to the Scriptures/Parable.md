 A simple story used to illustrate and teach a spiritual truth or principle. A parable is based on comparing an ordinary object or event to a truth, and the underlying meaning or message of a parable is often hidden to listeners who are not spiritually prepared to receive it ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 13#^verse-10|Matt. 13:10-17]]).

 Jesus often taught with parables. For a listing of His key parables, see [[Study Helps/Harmony of the Gospels/Introduction|Harmony of the Gospels]] in the appendix.
