 As used in the scriptures, to forgive generally means one of two things: (1) When God forgives men, He cancels or sets aside a required punishment for sin. Through the Atonement of Christ, forgiveness of sins is available to all who repent, except those guilty of murder or the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. (2) As people forgive each other, they treat one another with Christlike love and have no bad feelings toward those who have offended them ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-43|Matt. 5:43-45]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-12|6:12-15]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 17#^verse-3|Luke 17:3-4]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 7#^verse-19|1 Ne. 7:19-21]]).
