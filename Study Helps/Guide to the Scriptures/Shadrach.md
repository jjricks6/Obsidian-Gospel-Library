 In the Old Testament, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were three Israelite youths who, along with Daniel, were brought into the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Shadrach's Hebrew name was Hananiah. The four young men refused to defile themselves by partaking of the king's meat and wine ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1|Dan. 1]]). Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were thrown into a fiery furnace by the king but were miraculously preserved ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 3|Dan. 3]]).
