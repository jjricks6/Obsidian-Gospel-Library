## The book of Abraham

 Ancient records written by Abraham that came into the possession of the Church in 1835. The records and some mummies were discovered in Egyptian catacombs by Antonio Lebolo, who willed them to Michael Chandler. Chandler exhibited them in the United States in 1835. Some friends of Joseph Smith bought them from Chandler and gave them to the Prophet, who translated them. Some of these records are now found in the Pearl of Great Price.

 [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 1|Chapter 1]] records Abraham's experiences in Ur of the Chaldees, where wicked priests tried to sacrifice him. [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2|Chapter 2]] tells of his journey to Canaan. The Lord appeared to him and made covenants with him. [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 3|Chapter 3]] records that Abraham saw the universe and perceived the relationships between heavenly bodies. [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 4|Chapters 4-5]] are another account of the Creation.

## The seed of Abraham

 People who, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ, receive the promises and covenants made by God to Abraham. Men and women may receive these blessings if they are literally of Abraham's lineage or if they are adopted into his family by embracing the gospel and being baptized ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3#^verse-26|Gal. 3:26-29]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-1|4:1-7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-33|D&C 84:33-34]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 103#^verse-17|103:17]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-30|132:30-32]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-9|Abr. 2:9-11]]). Literal descendants of Abraham may lose their blessings by disobedience ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 4#^verse-13|Rom. 4:13]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 9#^verse-6|9:6-8]]).
