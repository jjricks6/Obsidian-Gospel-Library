 The scriptures mention two types of breastplates: (1) The front part of a soldier's protective clothing or armor. In a symbolic sense, Saints should wear a breastplate of righteousness to protect themselves against evil ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 59#^verse-17|Isa. 59:17]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 6#^verse-14|Eph. 6:14]]). (2) An article of clothing worn by the high priest in the law of Moses ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 28#^verse-13|Ex. 28:13-30]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 39#^verse-8|39:8-21]]). It was made of linen and bore twelve precious stones. It is sometimes referred to in connection with the Urim and Thummim ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 17#^verse-1|D&C 17:1]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-35|JS—H 1:35, 42, 52]]).
