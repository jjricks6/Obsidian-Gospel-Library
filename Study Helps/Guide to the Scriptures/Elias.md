 There are several uses of the name or title Elias in the scriptures:

## Elijah

 Elias is the New Testament (Greek) form of Elijah (Hebrew), as in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-3|Matt. 17:3-4]], [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-25|Luke 4:25-26]], and [[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-17|James 5:17]]. In these instances, Elias was the ancient prophet Elijah whose ministry is recorded in 1 and 2 Kings.

## Forerunner

 Elias is also a title for one who is a forerunner. For example, John the Baptist was an Elias because he was sent to prepare the way for Jesus ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-12|Matt. 17:12-13]]).

## Restorer

 The title Elias has also been applied to others who had specific missions to fulfill, such as John the Revelator ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 77#^verse-14|D&C 77:14]]) and Gabriel ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-11|Luke 1:11-20]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-6|D&C 27:6-7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-12|110:12]]).

## A man in Abrahamâs dispensation

 A prophet called Esaias or Elias who apparently lived in the days of Abraham ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-11|D&C 84:11-13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-12|110:12]]).
