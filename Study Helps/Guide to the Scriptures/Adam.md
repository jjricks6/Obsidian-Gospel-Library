 The first man created on earth.

 Adam is the father and patriarch of the human race on the earth. His transgression in the Garden of Eden ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3|Gen. 3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 29#^verse-40|D&C 29:40-42]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4|Moses 4]]) caused him to "fall" and become mortal, a step necessary in order for mankind to progress on this earth ([[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-14|2 Ne. 2:14-29]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 12#^verse-21|Alma 12:21-26]]).

He is the archangel ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-54|D&C 107:54]]) and will come again to the earth as the patriarch of the human family ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 116|D&C 116]]).

 Adam named every living creature, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-19|Gen. 2:19-20]] ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-19|Moses 3:19-20]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 5#^verse-20|Abr. 5:20-21]]).

 Adam and Eve were married by God, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-18|Gen. 2:18-25]] ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-18|Moses 3:18-25]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 5#^verse-14|Abr. 5:14-21]]).

 Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan, partook of the forbidden fruit, and were cast out of the Garden of Eden, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3|Gen. 3]] ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4|Moses 4]]).

 Adam was 930 years old at his death, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5#^verse-5|Gen. 5:5]] ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-12|Moses 6:12]]).

 Adam was the first man, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-16|D&C 84:16]].

 Before his death Adam called his righteous posterity together at Adam-ondi-Ahman and blessed them, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-53|D&C 107:53-57]].
