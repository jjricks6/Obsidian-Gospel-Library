 An Old Testament prophet and leader, and the successor of Moses. He was born in Egypt before the children of Israel escaped ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 14#^verse-26|Num. 14:26-31]]). He and Caleb were among the twelve spies sent to Canaan. They alone gave a good report of the land ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 13#^verse-8|Num. 13:8, 16-33]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 14#^verse-1|14:1-10]]). He died at the age of 110 ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 24#^verse-29|Josh. 24:29]]). Joshua was a great example of a devout prophet-warrior.

## The book of Joshua

 This book is named after Joshua because he was the principal figure in it and not because he was the author. [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 1|Chapters 1-12]] describe the conquest of Canaan; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 13|chapters 13-24]] tell of the tribes of Israel dividing up the land and of Joshua's final counsels.

 Two notable verses in the book of Joshua are the Lord's command to him to meditate on the scriptures ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 1#^verse-8|Josh. 1:8]]) and Joshua's call to the people to be faithful to the Lord ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 24#^verse-15|Josh. 24:15]]).
