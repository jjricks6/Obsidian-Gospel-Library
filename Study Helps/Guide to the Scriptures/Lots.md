 They parted his garments, casting lots, [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-35|Matt. 27:35]] ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 22#^verse-18|Ps. 22:18]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 15#^verse-24|Mark 15:24]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-34|Luke 23:34]]; [[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-24|John 19:24]]).
