 To voluntarily refrain from eating or drinking for the purpose of drawing closer to the Lord and requesting His blessings. When individuals and groups fast, they should also pray to understand God's will and to develop greater spiritual strength. Fasting has always been practiced by true believers.

 In the Church today, one Sabbath day each month is set aside for the purpose of fasting. During this time, Church members go without food and water for a period of time. They then contribute to the Church the money that they would have spent on food for those meals. This money is called a fast offering. The Church uses the fast offerings to assist the poor and needy.
