 Once known as Salem ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-18|Gen. 14:18]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 76#^verse-2|Ps. 76:2]]), Jerusalem was a Jebusite city until it was captured by David ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 10#^verse-1|Josh. 10:1]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 15#^verse-8|15:8]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 5#^verse-6|2 Sam. 5:6-7]]), who made it his capital.
