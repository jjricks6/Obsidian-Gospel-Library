 In ancient times, the Lord's prophets anointed with oil those who would perform special duties, such as Aaron or the priests or the kings who would rule over Israel. In the Church today, to anoint is to place a small amount of consecrated oil on a person's head as part of a special blessing. This can be done only under the authority and power of the Melchizedek Priesthood. After the anointing, a person acting by authority of that same priesthood may seal the anointing and give a special blessing to the one anointed.
