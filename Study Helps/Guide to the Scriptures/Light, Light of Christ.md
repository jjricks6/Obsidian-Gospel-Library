 Divine energy, power, or influence that proceeds from God through Christ and gives life and light to all things. It is the law by which all things are governed in heaven and on earth ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-6|D&C 88:6-13]]). It also helps people understand gospel truths and helps to put them on the gospel path that leads to salvation ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-19|John 3:19-21]]; [[New Testament/John/John 12#^verse-46|12:46]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 26#^verse-15|Alma 26:15]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 32#^verse-35|32:35]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-28|D&C 93:28-29, 31-32, 40, 42]]).

 The light of Christ should not be confused with the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ is not a person. It is an influence that comes from God and prepares a person to receive the Holy Ghost. It is an influence for good in the lives of all people ([[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-9|John 1:9]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-46|D&C 84:46-47]]).

 One manifestation of the light of Christ is conscience, which helps a person choose between right and wrong ([[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 7#^verse-16|Moro. 7:16]]). As people learn more about the gospel, their consciences become more sensitive ([[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 7#^verse-12|Moro. 7:12-19]]). People who hearken to the light of Christ are led to the gospel of Jesus Christ ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-46|D&C 84:46-48]]).
