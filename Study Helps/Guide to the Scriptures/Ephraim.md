 In the Old Testament, the second son of Joseph and Asenath ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 41#^verse-50|Gen. 41:50-52]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 46#^verse-20|46:20]]). Contrary to the traditional manner, Ephraim received the birthright blessing instead of Manasseh, who was the elder son ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 48#^verse-17|Gen. 48:17-20]]). Ephraim became the father of the tribe of Ephraim.

## The tribe of Ephraim

 Ephraim was given the birthright in Israel ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-1|1 Chr. 5:1-2]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 31#^verse-9|Jer. 31:9]]). In the last days their privilege and responsibility is to bear the priesthood, take the message of the restored gospel to the world, and raise an ensign to gather scattered Israel ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 11#^verse-12|Isa. 11:12-13]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 21#^verse-12|2 Ne. 21:12-13]]). The children of Ephraim will crown with glory those from the north countries who return in the last days ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 133#^verse-26|D&C 133:26-34]]).

## The stick of Ephraim or Joseph

 A record of one group from the tribe of Ephraim that was led from Jerusalem to America about 600 B.C. This group's record is called the stick of Ephraim or Joseph, or the Book of Mormon. It and the stick of Judah (the Bible) form a unified testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, His Resurrection, and His divine work among these two segments of the house of Israel.

 A branch of Ephraim will be broken off and will write another testament of Christ, [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 50#^verse-24|JST, Gen. 50:24-26, 30-31]].

 The stick of Judah and the stick of Joseph will become one, [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 37#^verse-15|Ezek. 37:15-19]].

 The writings of Judah and of Joseph shall grow together, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 3#^verse-12|2 Ne. 3:12]].

 The Lord speaks to many nations, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 29|2 Ne. 29]].

 The keys of the record of the stick of Ephraim were committed to Moroni, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-5|D&C 27:5]].
