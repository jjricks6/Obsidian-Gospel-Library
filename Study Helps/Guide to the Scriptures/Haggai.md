 An Old Testament prophet who prophesied in approximately 520 B.C. in Jerusalem, soon after the Jewish people returned from their exile in Babylonia ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 5#^verse-1|Ezra 5:1]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 6#^verse-14|6:14]]). He spoke of rebuilding the Lord's temple in Jerusalem and reproved the people because it had not been finished. He also wrote of the millennial temple and reign of the Savior.

## The book of Haggai

 In [[Old Testament/Haggai/Haggai 1|chapter 1]], the Lord rebuked the people for living in their finished houses while the temple remained unbuilt. [[Old Testament/Haggai/Haggai 2|Chapter 2]] records Haggai's prophecy that the Lord will give peace in His temple.
