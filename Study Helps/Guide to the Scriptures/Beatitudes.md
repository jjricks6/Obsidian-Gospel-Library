 A series of teachings that Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount that describe a refined and spiritual character ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-3|Matt. 5:3-12]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 6#^verse-20|Luke 6:20-23]]). The Beatitudes are arranged in such a way that each statement builds upon the one that precedes it. A more comprehensive and accurate record of the Beatitudes is found in [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 12|3 Ne. 12]].
