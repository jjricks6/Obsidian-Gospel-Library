 A book in the Old Testament containing reflections on some of the deepest problems of life.

 The book's author, the Preacher, writes much of the book from the point of view of those who are without gospel understanding. He writes according to the feelings of the people of the worldâ€”that is, those "under the sun" ([[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes/Ecclesiastes 1#^verse-9|Eccl. 1:9]]). Much of the book seems negative and pessimistic ([[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes/Ecclesiastes 9#^verse-5|Eccl. 9:5, 10]]). This is not how the Lord would have us perceive life but rather how the Preacher has observed that things appear to unenlightened men on earth. The most spiritual part of the book is in [[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes/Ecclesiastes 11|chapters 11 and 12]], where the writer concludes that the only thing of lasting value is obedience to God's commandments.
