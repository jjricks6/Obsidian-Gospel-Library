 The name means the "Shining One" or "Lightbearer." He is also known as the Son of the Morning. Lucifer was a spirit son of Heavenly Father and led the rebellion in the premortal life. The name Lucifer appears only once in the Bible ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 14#^verse-12|Isa. 14:12]]). Latter-day revelation gives more detail on Lucifer's fall ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-25|D&C 76:25-29]]).

 Lucifer fell in the premortal existence, [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 14#^verse-12|Isa. 14:12]] ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 10#^verse-18|Luke 10:18]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 24#^verse-12|2 Ne. 24:12]]).

 After his fall he became Satan and the devil, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-25|D&C 76:25-29]] ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4#^verse-1|Moses 4:1-4]]).
