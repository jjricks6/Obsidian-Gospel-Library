 In the Old Testament, Jeroboam was the first king of the northern part of divided Israel. He was a member of the tribe of Ephraim. The wicked Jeroboam led a revolt against the house of Judah and the family of David.

 Jeroboam set up idols for the people in Dan and Bethel to worship, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12#^verse-28|1 Kgs. 12:28-29]].

 Ahijah rebuked Jeroboam, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-6|1 Kgs. 14:6-16]].

 Jeroboam was remembered for having brought a terrible sin to Israel, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 15#^verse-34|1 Kgs. 15:34]] ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12#^verse-30|1 Kgs. 12:30]]).
