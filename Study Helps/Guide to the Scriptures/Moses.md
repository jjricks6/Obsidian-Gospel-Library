 An Old Testament prophet who led the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage and gave to them a set of religious, social, and dietary laws as revealed by God.

 Moses' ministry extended beyond the limits of his own mortal lifetime. Joseph Smith taught that, in company with Elijah, he came to the Mount of Transfiguration and bestowed priesthood keys upon Peter, James, and John ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-3|Matt. 17:3-4]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-4|Mark 9:4-9]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 9#^verse-30|Luke 9:30]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 63#^verse-21|D&C 63:21]]).

 Moses appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on April 3, 1836, in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, and conferred on them the keys of the gathering of Israel ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-11|D&C 110:11]]).

 Latter-day revelation speaks much concerning Moses. He is mentioned frequently in the Book of Mormon, and from the Doctrine and Covenants we learn about his ministry ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-20|D&C 84:20-26]]) and that he received the priesthood from his father-in-law Jethro ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-6|D&C 84:6]]).

 Latter-day revelation also confirms the biblical account of his ministry among the children of Israel and reaffirms that he was the author of the five books that begin the Old Testament ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5#^verse-11|1 Ne. 5:11]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 1#^verse-40|Moses 1:40-41]]).
