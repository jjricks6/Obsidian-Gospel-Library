 For Latter-day Saints, sacrament refers to the ordinance of partaking of bread and water in remembrance of Christ's atoning sacrifice. The broken bread represents His broken flesh; the water represents the blood that He shed to atone for our sins ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11#^verse-23|1 Cor. 11:23-25]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-2|D&C 27:2]]). When worthy Church members take the sacrament, they promise to take upon them the name of Christ, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments. Through this ordinance, Church members renew their baptismal covenants.

 At the Last Supper, Jesus explained the ordinance of the sacrament as He ate with the Twelve Apostles ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-17|Matt. 26:17-28]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-1|Luke 22:1-20]]).

 Jesus took bread, and blessed it; and he took the cup, and gave thanks, [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-26|Matt. 26:26-28]] ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 14#^verse-22|Mark 14:22-24]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-19|Luke 22:19-20]]).

 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, [[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-54|John 6:54]].

 He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul, [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11#^verse-29|1 Cor. 11:29]] ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 18#^verse-29|3 Ne. 18:29]]).

 Jesus taught his twelve Nephite disciples about the sacrament, [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 18#^verse-1|3 Ne. 18:1-11]].

 Jesus taught these disciples to forbid unworthy people from partaking of the sacrament, [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 18#^verse-28|3 Ne. 18:28-29]] ([[Book of Mormon/Mormon/Mormon 9#^verse-29|Morm. 9:29]]).

 The sacrament prayers are given, [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 4|Moro. 4-5]] ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-75|D&C 20:75-79]]).

 The sacrament is to be administered by a priest or elder, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-46|D&C 20:46, 76]].

 Teachers and deacons do not have authority to bless the sacrament, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-58|D&C 20:58]].

 Liquids other than wine may be used for the sacrament, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-1|D&C 27:1-4]].
