 An Old Testament prophet of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and a trusted adviser of several of that country's kings.

 Elisha had a gentle and affectionate disposition, without that fiery zeal by which his master, Elijah, was distinguished. His notable miracles ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2|2 Kgs. 2-5]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8|8]]) testify that he truly received Elijah's power when he succeeded Elijah as prophet ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2#^verse-9|2 Kgs. 2:9-12]]). For example, he healed the waters of a bitter spring, divided the waters of the Jordan River, multiplied a widow's oil, raised a boy from the dead, cured a man of leprosy, caused an iron ax to float, and struck the Syrians with blindness ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2|2 Kgs. 2-6]]). His ministry lasted more than fifty years during the reigns of Jehoram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, and Joash.

 Received the mantle of Elijah, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2#^verse-13|2 Kgs. 2:13]].

 Multiplied the widow's oil, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 4#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 4:1-7]].

 Raised the Shunammite woman's son from the dead, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 4#^verse-18|2 Kgs. 4:18-37]].

 Healed Naaman, the Syrian, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 5#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 5:1-14]].

 Blinded the Syrian soldiers, and his servant's eyes were opened, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 6#^verse-8|2 Kgs. 6:8-23]].
