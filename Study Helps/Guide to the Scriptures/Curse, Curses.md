 In the scriptures, a curse is the application of divine law that allows or brings judgments and their consequences upon a thing, person, or people primarily because of unrighteousness. Curses are a manifestation of God's divine love and justice. They may be invoked directly by God or pronounced by His authorized servants. Sometimes, the full reasons for curses are known only to God. In addition, a cursed state is experienced by those who willfully disobey God and thereby withdraw themselves from the Spirit of the Lord.

 The Lord may remove curses because of the individual's or people's faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 23#^verse-16|Alma 23:16-18]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 2#^verse-14|3 Ne. 2:14-16]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Articles of Faith#^verse-3|A of F 1:3]]).
