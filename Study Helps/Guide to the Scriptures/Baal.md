 A male sun-god worshiped principally in Phoenicia ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 16#^verse-31|1 Kgs. 16:31]]) but also worshiped in different ways in various places: by the Moabites as Baal-peor ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 25#^verse-1|Num. 25:1-3]]), at Shechem as Baal-berith ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 8#^verse-33|Judg. 8:33]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 9#^verse-4|9:4]]), at Ekron as Baal-zebub ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 1#^verse-2|2 Kgs. 1:2]]). Baal may be the same as Bel of Babylon and Zeus of Greece. The word Baal expresses the relationship between a lord and his slave. The usual symbol for Baal was a bull. Ashtoreth was the goddess generally worshiped along with Baal.

 Baal was sometimes combined with another name or word to indicate a connection with Baal, such as a place where he was worshiped or a person with attributes like those of Baal. Later, because Baal came to have very evil meanings, the word Bosheth replaced it in those combined names. Bosheth means "shame."
