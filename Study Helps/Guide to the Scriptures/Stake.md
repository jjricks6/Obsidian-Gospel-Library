 One of the organizational and administrative units of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A stake is composed of a number of wards or branches. It generally has a set of geographical boundaries and conforms to the tent image described in [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 54#^verse-2|Isaiah 54:2]]: "Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes." Each stake of Zion supports and helps to hold up the Church the way a tent or tabernacle is held up by its stakes. A stake is the gathering place for the remnants of scattered Israel ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 82#^verse-13|D&C 82:13-14]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 101#^verse-17|101:17-21]]).
