 The Jordan River runs from the sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. The river is 100 miles (160 kilometers) long and is formed by the union of several springs flowing from Mount Hermon. It is the most important river in Israel.

 Two important events connected with this river are the Lord's parting of the river for the crossing of Israel ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 3#^verse-14|Josh. 3:14-17]]) and the baptism of Jesus Christ ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 3#^verse-13|Matt. 3:13-17]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 10#^verse-9|1 Ne. 10:9]]).
