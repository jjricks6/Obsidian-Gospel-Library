 One of the names for Jesus Christ. It comes from words in Hebrew that mean "God with us."

 Immanuel is a name-title given as a sign of God's deliverance ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 7#^verse-14|Isa. 7:14]]). Isaiah's reference to Immanuel is specifically identified by Matthew as a prophecy of Jesus' birth into mortality ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 1#^verse-18|Matt. 1:18-25]]). The name also appears in latter-day scripture ([[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 17#^verse-14|2 Ne. 17:14]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 18#^verse-8|18:8]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-22|D&C 128:22]]).
