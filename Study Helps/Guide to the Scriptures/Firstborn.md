 In the time of the ancient patriarchs, the firstborn son received the birthright ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 43#^verse-33|Gen. 43:33]]) and thus inherited the leadership of the family upon the death of the father.

 Under the law of Moses, the firstborn son was regarded as belonging to God. The firstborn received a double portion of his father's possessions ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 21#^verse-17|Deut. 21:17]]). After his father's death, he was responsible for the care of his mother and sisters.

 Jesus was the firstborn of the spirit children of our Heavenly Father, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, and the first to rise from the dead in the Resurrection ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 1#^verse-13|Col. 1:13-18]]). Faithful Saints become members of the Church of the Firstborn in eternity ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-21|D&C 93:21-22]]).
