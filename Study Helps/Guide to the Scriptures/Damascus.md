 An ancient city of Syria.

 Damascus stands on a rich plain on the edge of the desert and is well watered by the river Barada. It is mentioned frequently in the scriptures (beginning with [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-15|Gen. 14:15]]). Paul was on his way to Damascus when the resurrected Lord appeared to him ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-1|Acts 9:1-27]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 22#^verse-5|22:5-16]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-12|26:12-20]]).
