 A book in the New Testament, taken from a letter written by Paul. Paul's letter to Philemon is a private letter about Onesimus, a slave who had robbed his master, Philemon, and run away to Rome. Paul sent him back to his master at Colosse in company with Tychicus, the bearer of Paul's letter to the Colossians. Paul asked that Onesimus be forgiven and received back as a fellow Christian. Paul wrote this letter while he was in prison in Rome the first time.
