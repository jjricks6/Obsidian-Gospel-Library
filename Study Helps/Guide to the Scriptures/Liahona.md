 In the Book of Mormon, a brass ball with two pointers that gave directions—as a compass—and also spiritual instruction to Lehi and his followers when they were righteous. The Lord provided the Liahona and gave instructions through it.

 Lehi found a brass ball with two spindles that pointed the way that Lehi and his family should go, [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 16#^verse-10|1 Ne. 16:10]].

 The ball worked according to faith and diligence, [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 16#^verse-28|1 Ne. 16:28-29]] ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-40|Alma 37:40]]).

 Benjamin gave the ball to Mosiah, [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 1#^verse-16|Mosiah 1:16]].

 The ball or director was called the Liahona, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-38|Alma 37:38]].

 The Liahona was compared to the word of Christ, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-43|Alma 37:43-45]].

 The Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon are to see the director given to Lehi, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 17#^verse-1|D&C 17:1]].
