 The home of our first parents, Adam and Eve ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-8|Gen. 2:8-3:24]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 4#^verse-16|4:16]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-19|2 Ne. 2:19-25]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3|Moses 3-4]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 5|Abr. 5]]), designated as a garden, eastward in Eden. Adam and Eve were sent out of Eden after eating of the forbidden fruit and becoming mortal ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4#^verse-29|Moses 4:29]]).
