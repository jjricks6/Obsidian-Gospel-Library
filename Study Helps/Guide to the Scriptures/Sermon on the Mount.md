 A discourse by the Lord Jesus Christ to His disciples who were about to be sent forth on missions ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5|Matt. 5-7]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 6#^verse-20|Luke 6:20-49]]). The Lord gave the sermon soon after the calling of the Twelve.

 The sermon is clarified by the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and by a similar sermon recorded in [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 12|3 Nephi 12-14]] that show that important parts of the sermon have been lost from the account in Matthew.
