 The Holy Ghost is the Holy Spirit of Promise ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 2#^verse-33|Acts 2:33]]). He confirms as acceptable to God the righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants of men. The Holy Spirit of Promise witnesses to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept.

 They who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-51|D&C 76:51-60]] ([[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 1#^verse-13|Eph. 1:13-14]]).

 All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise to have force after this life, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-7|D&C 132:7, 18-19, 26]].
