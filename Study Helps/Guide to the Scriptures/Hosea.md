 An Old Testament prophet who prophesied in the northern kingdom of Israel during the latter part of the reign of Jeroboam â¡. He lived during a time of national decline and ruin, the result of the sin of Israel.

## The book of Hosea

 The book's basic theme is the love of God for His people. All His chastisements were inflicted in love, and Israel's restoration shall be due to His love ([[Old Testament/Hosea/Hosea 2#^verse-19|Hosea 2:19]]; [[Old Testament/Hosea/Hosea 14#^verse-4|14:4]]). In contrast, Hosea shows Israel's treachery and infidelity. Yet God is able to look forward to Israel's final redemption ([[Old Testament/Hosea/Hosea 11#^verse-12|Hosea 11:12-14:9]]).
