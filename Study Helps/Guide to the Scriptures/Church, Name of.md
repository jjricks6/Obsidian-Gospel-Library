 In the Book of Mormon, when Jesus Christ visited the righteous Nephites shortly after His Resurrection, He said that His Church should bear His name ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 27#^verse-3|3 Ne. 27:3-8]]). In modern times the Lord revealed the name of the Church to be "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 115#^verse-4|D&C 115:4]]).
