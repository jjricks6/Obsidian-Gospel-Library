 In the New Testament, a young missionary companion of Paul during Paul's ministry ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-1|Acts 16:1-3]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-1|2 Tim. 1:1-5]]); the son of a Greek father and Jewish mother; he and his parents lived in Lystra.

 Paul spoke of Timothy as his "own son in the faith" ([[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1#^verse-2|1 Tim. 1:2, 18]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-2|2 Tim. 1:2]]).
