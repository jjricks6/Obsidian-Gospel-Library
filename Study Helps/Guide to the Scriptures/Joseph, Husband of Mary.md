 Husband of Mary, mother of Jesus. Joseph was a descendant of David ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 1#^verse-1|Matt. 1:1-16]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-23|Luke 3:23-38]]) and lived in Nazareth. He was espoused to Mary. Just before their marriage, Mary received a visit from the angel Gabriel, who announced that Mary had been chosen to be the mother of the Savior ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-26|Luke 1:26-35]]). Joseph also received revelation of this divine birth ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 1#^verse-20|Matt. 1:20-25]]).

 Mary was Jesus' only earthly parent because God the Father was Jesus' father. But the Jews thought of Joseph as Jesus' father, and Jesus treated him as such ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-48|Luke 2:48, 51]]). Warned by heavenly dreams, Joseph preserved the infant Jesus' life by fleeing to Egypt ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 2#^verse-13|Matt. 2:13-14]]). After Herod died, an angel instructed Joseph to take the Christ child back to Israel ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 2#^verse-19|Matt. 2:19-23]]).
