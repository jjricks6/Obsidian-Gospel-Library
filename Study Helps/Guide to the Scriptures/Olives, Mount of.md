 A hill east of the Kidron Valley, east of Jerusalem. On its western slopes, near the bottom, is the garden of Gethsemane. Bethphage and Bethany are located on the top and east slope. This mount was the place of many biblical events ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 24#^verse-3|Matt. 24:3]]) and will also be an important place in events of the latter days ([[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 14#^verse-3|Zech. 14:3-5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 45#^verse-48|D&C 45:48-54]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 133#^verse-20|133:20]]).
