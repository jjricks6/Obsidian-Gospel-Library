 The process by which mankind became mortal on this earth. When Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit, they became mortal, that is, subject to sin and death. Adam became the "first flesh" upon the earth ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-7|Moses 3:7]]). Latter-day revelation makes clear that the Fall is a blessing and that Adam and Eve should be honored as the first parents of all mankind.

 The Fall was a necessary step in man's progress. Because God knew that the Fall would occur, He had planned in the premortal life for a Savior. Jesus Christ came in the meridian of time to atone for the Fall of Adam and also for man's individual sins on condition of man's repentance.
