 That part of a living being that exists before mortal birth, dwells in the physical body during mortality, and exists after death as a separate being until the Resurrection. All living things—mankind, animals, and plants—were spirits before any form of life existed upon the earth ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-4|Gen. 2:4-5]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-4|Moses 3:4-7]]). The spirit body looks like the physical body ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 11#^verse-11|1 Ne. 11:11]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 3#^verse-15|Ether 3:15-16]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 77#^verse-2|D&C 77:2]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 129|129]]). Spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure than mortal element or matter ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 131#^verse-7|D&C 131:7]]).

 Every person is literally a son or a daughter of God, having been born as a spirit to Heavenly Parents before being born to mortal parents on the earth ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12#^verse-9|Heb. 12:9]]). Each person on earth has an immortal spirit body in addition to a body of flesh and bone. As sometimes defined in scripture, the spirit and the physical body together constitute the soul ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-7|Gen. 2:7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-15|D&C 88:15]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-7|Moses 3:7, 9, 19]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 5#^verse-7|Abr. 5:7]]). A spirit can live without a physical body, but the physical body cannot live without the spirit ([[New Testament/James/James 2#^verse-26|James 2:26]]). Physical death is the separation of the spirit from the body. In the Resurrection, the spirit is reunited with the same physical body of flesh and bone it possessed as a mortal, with two major differences: they will never be separated again, and the physical body will be immortal and perfected ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 11#^verse-45|Alma 11:45]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 138#^verse-16|D&C 138:16-17]]).

 A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have, [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 24#^verse-39|Luke 24:39]].

 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God, [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-16|Rom. 8:16]].

 Christ ministered to the righteous spirits in paradise, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 138#^verse-28|D&C 138:28-30]] ([[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 3#^verse-18|1 Pet. 3:18-19]]).

 Ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-59|Moses 6:59]].

 He stood among those that were spirits, [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 3#^verse-23|Abr. 3:23]].
