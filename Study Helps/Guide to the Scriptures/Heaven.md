 The term heaven has two basic meanings in the scriptures. (1) It is the place where God lives and the future home of the Saints ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-12|Gen. 28:12]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 11#^verse-4|Ps. 11:4]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-9|Matt. 6:9]]). (2) It is the expanse around the earth ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 1#^verse-1|Gen. 1:1, 17]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-10|Ex. 24:10]]). Heaven is clearly not paradise, which is the temporary place for the faithful spirits of those who have lived and died on this earth. Jesus visited paradise after His death on the cross, but on the third day, He informed Mary that He had not yet been to the Father ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-39|Luke 23:39-44]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-17|John 20:17]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 138#^verse-11|D&C 138:11-37]]).
