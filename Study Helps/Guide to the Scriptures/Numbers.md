 The fourth book in the Old Testament. Moses wrote the book of Numbers. The book of Numbers relates the story of Israel's journey from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. One of the important lessons it teaches is that God's people must walk by faith, trusting His promises, if they are to continue successfully. It recounts God's punishment of Israel for disobedience and provides information about Israelite laws. The name of the book is derived from the prominence of census figures ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1|Num. 1-2]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 26|26]]).

 [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1|Chapters 1-10]] tell of the Israelite preparation for departure from Sinai. [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 11|Chapters 11-14]] describe the march itself, the sending of spies into Canaan, and Israel's refusal to enter the promised land. [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 15|Chapters 15-19]] note various laws and historical events. [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 20|Chapters 20-36]] are the history of the people's last year in the wilderness.
