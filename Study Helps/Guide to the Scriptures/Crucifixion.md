 A Roman form of execution, common during New Testament times, in which the person was put to death by tying or nailing his hands and feet to a cross. It was usually done only to slaves and the lowest criminals. Crucifixion was often preceded by scourging or whipping ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 15#^verse-15|Mark 15:15]]). The person being crucified was usually made to carry his own cross to the place of execution ([[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-16|John 19:16-17]]). His clothing was usually taken by the soldiers who carried out the sentence ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-35|Matt. 27:35]]). The cross was driven into the ground so that the feet of the person were only a foot or two above the ground. The cross was watched by soldiers until the person on the cross died, which sometimes took up to three days ([[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-31|John 19:31-37]]).

 Jesus Christ was crucified because a group of unbelievers falsely charged Him with sedition against Caesar and blasphemy because He said He was the Son of God. A purple robe ([[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-2|John 19:2]]), a crown of thorns, and other insults were given to Jesus ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-67|Matt. 26:67]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 14#^verse-65|Mark 14:65]]).
