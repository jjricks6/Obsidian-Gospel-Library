 A group of people in the Book of Mormon, many of whom were descendants of Laman, the eldest son of Lehi. They felt they had been wronged by Nephi and his descendants ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 10#^verse-11|Mosiah 10:11-17]]). As a result, they rebelled against the Nephites and often rejected the teachings of the gospel. However, shortly before the birth of Jesus Christ, the Lamanites accepted the gospel and were more righteous than the Nephites ([[Book of Mormon/Helaman/Helaman 6#^verse-34|Hel. 6:34-36]]). Two hundred years after Christ visited the Americas, both the Lamanites and the Nephites became wicked and began to wage war against each other. Around A.D. 400, the Lamanites completely destroyed the Nephite nation.

 The Lamanites overcame the seed of Nephi, [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 12#^verse-19|1 Ne. 12:19-20]].

 The Lamanites hated the Nephites, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 5#^verse-14|2 Ne. 5:14]].

 The Lamanites shall be a scourge to the Nephites, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 5#^verse-25|2 Ne. 5:25]].

 The Book of Mormon will restore to the Lamanites a knowledge of their forefathers and of the gospel of Jesus Christ, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 30#^verse-3|2 Ne. 30:3-6]] ([[Book of Mormon/Title Page of the Book of Mormon|title page of the Book of Mormon]]).

 The Lamanites are a remnant of the Jews, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 19#^verse-27|D&C 19:27]].

 The Lamanites shall blossom as the rose before the Lord's coming, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 49#^verse-24|D&C 49:24]].
