 In Greek, Apostle means "one sent forth." It was the title Jesus gave to the Twelve whom He chose and ordained to be His closest disciples and helpers during His ministry on earth ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 6#^verse-13|Luke 6:13]]; [[New Testament/John/John 15#^verse-16|John 15:16]]). He sent them forth to represent Him and to minister for Him after His Ascension into heaven. Both anciently and in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the restored Church today, an Apostle is a special witness of Jesus Christ in all the world to testify of His divinity and of His resurrection from the dead ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1#^verse-22|Acts 1:22]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-23|D&C 107:23]]).
