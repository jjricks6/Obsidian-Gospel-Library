 A council of twelve high priests.

 In the early days of the restored Church, the term high council referred to two different governing bodies: (1) the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-33|D&C 107:33, 38]]) and (2) the high council serving within each of the stakes ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 102|D&C 102]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-36|107:36]]).
