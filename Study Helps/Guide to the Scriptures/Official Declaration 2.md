 A doctrinal statement regarding who may hold the priesthood of God, now printed in the final pages of the Doctrine and Covenants. In early June 1978, the Lord revealed to President Spencer W. Kimball that the priesthood should be given to all worthy male members of the Church. This made the priesthood available to all worthy men and temple blessings available to all worthy members, regardless of race or color. On September 30, 1978, this declaration was presented to the general conference of the Church and unanimously accepted.
