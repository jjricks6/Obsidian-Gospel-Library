 In one sense the Book of Life is the total of a person's thoughts and actionsâ€”the record of his life. However, the scriptures also indicate that a heavenly record is kept of the faithful, including their names and accounts of their righteous deeds.

 The Lord will blot sinners out of his book, [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 32#^verse-33|Ex. 32:33]].

 He that overcomes will not be blotted out of the book of life, [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 3#^verse-5|Rev. 3:5]].

 Another book was opened, which is the book of life, [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 20#^verse-12|Rev. 20:12]] ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-6|D&C 128:6-7]]).

 The names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 5#^verse-58|Alma 5:58]].
