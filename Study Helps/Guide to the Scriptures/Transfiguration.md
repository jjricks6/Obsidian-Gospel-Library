 The condition of persons who are temporarily changed in appearance and nature—that is, lifted to a higher spiritual level—so that they can endure the presence and glory of heavenly beings.

## Transfiguration of Christ

 Peter, James, and John saw the Lord glorified and transfigured before them. The Savior had before promised that Peter would receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16#^verse-13|Matt. 16:13-19]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-1|17:1-9]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-2|Mark 9:2-10]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 9#^verse-28|Luke 9:28-36]]; [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 1#^verse-16|2 Pet. 1:16-18]]). At this important event, the Savior, Moses, and Elias (Elijah) gave the promised keys of the priesthood to Peter, James, and John. With these priesthood keys, the Apostles had the power to continue the work of the kingdom after the Ascension of Jesus.

 Joseph Smith taught that on the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter, James, and John were also transfigured. They saw a vision of the earth as it will appear in its future glorified condition ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 63#^verse-20|D&C 63:20-21]]). They saw Moses and Elijah, two translated beings, and heard the voice of the Father. The Father said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-5|Matt. 17:5]]).

## Transfigured beings

 They saw the God of Israel, [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-9|Ex. 24:9-11]].

 The skin of his face shone while he talked with God, [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 34#^verse-29|Ex. 34:29]] ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-2|Mark 9:2-3]]).

 Jesus' face did shine, [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-2|Matt. 17:2]] ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-2|Mark 9:2-3]]).

 Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory, [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 3#^verse-7|2 Cor. 3:7]].

 Abinadi's face shown with exceeding luster, [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 13#^verse-5|Mosiah 13:5-9]].

 They were encircled about as if by fire, [[Book of Mormon/Helaman/Helaman 5#^verse-23|Hel. 5:23, 36, 43-45]] ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 17#^verse-24|3 Ne. 17:24]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 19#^verse-14|19:14]]).

 They were as white as the countenance of Jesus, [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 19#^verse-25|3 Ne. 19:25]].

 It did seem unto them like a transfiguration, [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 28#^verse-15|3 Ne. 28:15]].

 No man has seen God in the flesh, except quickened by the Spirit, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 67#^verse-10|D&C 67:10-12]].

 By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-12|D&C 76:12]].

 The glory of God was upon Moses, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 1#^verse-2|Moses 1:2]].

 His glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 1#^verse-11|Moses 1:11]].

 I beheld the heavens open, and I was clothed upon with glory, [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-3|Moses 7:3-4]].
