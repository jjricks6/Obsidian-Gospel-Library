 The fifth book of the Old Testament.

 Deuteronomy contains the three last discourses of Moses, which he delivered in the plains of Moab just before he was translated. The first discourse ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 1|chapters 1-4]]) is introductory. The second discourse ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 5|chapters 5-26]]) consists of two parts: (1) [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 5|chapters 5-11]]—the Ten Commandments and a practical explanation of them; and (2) [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12|chapters 12-26]]—a code of laws, which forms the nucleus of the whole book. The third discourse ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 27|chapters 27-30]]) contains a solemn renewal of the covenant between Israel and God and an announcement of the blessings that follow obedience and the curses that follow disobedience. [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 31|Chapters 31-34]] describe the delivery of the law to the Levites, Moses' song and last blessing, and the departure of Moses.
