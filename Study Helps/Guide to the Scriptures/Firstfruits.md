 The first crops gathered in a season. In Old Testament times, they were offered to the Lord ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 23#^verse-9|Lev. 23:9-20]]). Jesus Christ was the firstfruits unto God in that He was the first to be resurrected ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-20|1 Cor. 15:20, 23]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-9|2 Ne. 2:9]]). Those who accept the gospel and endure to the end in faithfulness are in a symbolic way the firstfruits, for they belong to God.

 Those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes are the firstfruits unto God, [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 14#^verse-4|Rev. 14:4]].

 They who shall first descend with Christ are the firstfruits, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-98|D&C 88:98]].
