 The third member of the Godhead ([[New Testament/1 John/1 John 5#^verse-7|1 Jn. 5:7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-28|D&C 20:28]]). He is a personage of Spirit, not having a body of flesh and bones ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 130#^verse-22|D&C 130:22]]). The Holy Ghost is often referred to as the Spirit, or the Spirit of God.

 The Holy Ghost performs several vital roles in the plan of salvation. (1) He bears witness of the Father and the Son ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 12#^verse-3|1 Cor. 12:3]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 28#^verse-11|3 Ne. 28:11]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 12#^verse-41|Ether 12:41]]). (2) He reveals the truth of all things ([[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-26|John 14:26]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-13|16:13]]; [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 10#^verse-5|Moro. 10:5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 39#^verse-6|D&C 39:6]]). (3) He sanctifies those who have repented and become baptized ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-5|John 3:5]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 27#^verse-20|3 Ne. 27:20]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-64|Moses 6:64-68]]). (4) He is the Holy Spirit of Promise ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-50|D&C 76:50-53]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-7|132:7, 18-19, 26]]).

 The power of the Holy Ghost can come upon a person before baptism and witness that the gospel is true. But the right to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, whenever one is worthy, is a gift that can be received only by the laying on of hands by a Melchizedek Priesthood holder after authorized baptism into the true Church of Jesus Christ.

 Jesus taught that all sins could be forgiven except blasphemy against the Holy Ghost ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 12#^verse-31|Matt. 12:31-32]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 3#^verse-28|Mark 3:28-29]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12#^verse-10|Luke 12:10]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 6#^verse-4|Heb. 6:4-8]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-34|D&C 76:34-35]]).
