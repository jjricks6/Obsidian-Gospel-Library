 Based on premortal worthiness, God chose those who would be the seed of Abraham and the house of Israel and become the covenant people ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 32#^verse-7|Deut. 32:7-9]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-9|Abr. 2:9-11]]). These people are given special blessings and duties so that they can bless all the nations of the world ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 11#^verse-5|Rom. 11:5-7]]; [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 1#^verse-2|1 Pet. 1:2]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 13#^verse-1|Alma 13:1-5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-99|D&C 84:99]]). However, even these chosen ones must be called and elected in this life in order to gain salvation.
