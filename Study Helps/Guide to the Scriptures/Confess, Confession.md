 The scriptures use confession in at least two ways. In one sense, to confess is to state one's faith in something, such as to confess that Jesus is the Christ ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 10#^verse-32|Matt. 10:32]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10#^verse-9|Rom. 10:9]]; [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 4#^verse-1|1 Jn. 4:1-3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-104|D&C 88:104]]).

 In another sense, to confess is to admit one's guilt, such as in a confession of sins. It is a duty of all persons to confess all their sins to the Lord and obtain His forgiveness ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 58#^verse-42|D&C 58:42-43]]). When necessary, sins should be confessed to the person or persons sinned against. Serious sins should be confessed to a Church official (in most cases the bishop).

 He shall confess that he has sinned, [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 5#^verse-5|Lev. 5:5]].

 They shall confess their iniquity, [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 26#^verse-40|Lev. 26:40-42]].
