 In the Old Testament, the eldest son of Jacob and Leah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 29#^verse-32|Gen. 29:32]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 37#^verse-21|37:21-22, 29]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 42#^verse-22|42:22, 37]]). Although Reuben was the firstborn, he lost his birthright because of sin ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 35#^verse-22|Gen. 35:22]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-3|49:3-4]]).

## The tribe of Reuben

 Jacob's blessing to Reuben is found in [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-3|Genesis 49:3]] and [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-6|Deuteronomy 33:6]]. The tribe's numbers gradually diminished, and though the tribe continued to exist, it became politically less important. Reuben's birthright went to Joseph and his sons because Joseph was the firstborn son of Jacob's second wife, Rachel ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-1|1 Chr. 5:1-2]]).
