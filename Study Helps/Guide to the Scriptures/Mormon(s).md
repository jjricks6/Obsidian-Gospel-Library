 The nickname Mormon was created by people who were not members of the Church to refer to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The name comes from the sacred book of scripture compiled by the ancient prophet Mormon and entitled the Book of Mormon. The name given by the Lord by which members of the Church are to be known is "Saints." The correct name of the Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
