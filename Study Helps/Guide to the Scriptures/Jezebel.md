 A wicked woman in the Old Testament from the land of Phoenicia. She was the wife of Ahab ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 16#^verse-30|1 Kgs. 16:30-31]]), a king of Israel who reigned while Elijah was prophet.

 Jezebel's marriage to Ahab, more than any other single event, caused the downfall of the northern kingdom of Israel; Jezebel introduced into Israel the worst forms of idol worship from her land in place of the worship of Jehovah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-13|1 Kgs. 18:13, 19]]).

 Jezebel killed many of God's prophets, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-4|1 Kgs. 18:4]].

 Jezebel tried to kill Elijah, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 19#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 19:1-3]].

 Jezebel's wickedness ended with her terrible death, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 9#^verse-30|2 Kgs. 9:30-37]].
