 Usually olive oil is meant when oil is mentioned in the scriptures. From Old Testament times, olive oil has been used for temple and tabernacle rites, for anointings, for burning in lamps, and for food. Olive oil is sometimes a symbol for purity and for the Holy Spirit and its influence ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 10#^verse-1|1 Sam. 10:1, 6]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 16#^verse-13|16:13]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 61#^verse-1|Isa. 61:1-3]]).
