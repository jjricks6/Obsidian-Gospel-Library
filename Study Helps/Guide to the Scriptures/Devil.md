 Satan. The devil is the enemy of righteousness and of those who seek to do the will of God. He is literally a spirit son of God and was at one time an angel in authority in the presence of God ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 14#^verse-12|Isa. 14:12]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-17|2 Ne. 2:17]]). However, he rebelled in the premortal life and persuaded a third part of the spirit children of the Father to rebel with him ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 29#^verse-36|D&C 29:36]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4#^verse-1|Moses 4:1-4]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 3#^verse-27|Abr. 3:27-28]]). They were cast out of heaven, were denied the opportunity of obtaining mortal bodies and experiencing mortal life, and will be eternally damned. Since the time the devil was cast out of heaven, he has sought constantly to deceive all men and women and lead them away from the work of God in order to make all mankind as miserable as he is ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 12#^verse-9|Rev. 12:9]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-27|2 Ne. 2:27]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 9#^verse-8|9:8-9]]).
