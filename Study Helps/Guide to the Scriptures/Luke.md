 The author of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts in the New Testament and a missionary companion of Paul. He was born to Greek parents and practiced medicine ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-14|Col. 4:14]]). Luke was well educated. He identified himself as a companion to the Apostle Paul when he joined Paul at Troas ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-10|Acts 16:10-11]]). Luke was also with Paul at Philippi on Paul's last journey to Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 20#^verse-6|Acts 20:6]]), and the two were together until their arrival in Rome. Luke was also with Paul during his second Roman imprisonment ([[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-11|2 Tim. 4:11]]). Tradition says he died a martyr.

## The Gospel of Luke

 An account that Luke wrote of Jesus Christ and His mortal ministry. The book of Acts of the Apostles is a continuation of the Gospel of Luke. Luke left a well-written account of Jesus' ministry, presenting Jesus as the Savior of both Jews and Gentiles. He wrote much about Jesus' teachings and His doings. In Luke we get the only accounts of the visits of Gabriel to Zacharias and Mary ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1|Luke 1]]); the visit of the shepherds to the baby Jesus ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-8|Luke 2:8-18]]); Jesus at the temple at age twelve ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-41|Luke 2:41-52]]); the seventy charged and sent ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 10#^verse-1|Luke 10:1-24]]); Jesus sweating blood ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-44|Luke 22:44]]); Jesus' discussion with the thief on the cross ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-39|Luke 23:39-43]]); and Jesus eating fish and honey after His Resurrection ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 24#^verse-42|Luke 24:42-43]]).
