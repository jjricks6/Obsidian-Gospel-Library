 A small, round food substance with the taste of honey wafers ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 16#^verse-14|Ex. 16:14-31]]) or of fresh oil ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 11#^verse-7|Num. 11:7-8]]). The Lord provided it to feed the children of Israel during their forty years in the wilderness ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 16#^verse-4|Ex. 16:4-5, 14-30, 35]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 5#^verse-12|Josh. 5:12]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 17#^verse-28|1 Ne. 17:28]]).

 The children of Israel called it manna (or man-hu in Hebrew)—which meant "What is it?"—because they did not know what it was ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 16#^verse-15|Ex. 16:15]]). It was also called "angels' food" and "bread from heaven" ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 78#^verse-24|Ps. 78:24-25]]; [[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-31|John 6:31]]). It was a symbol for Christ, who would be the Bread of Life ([[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-31|John 6:31-35]]).
