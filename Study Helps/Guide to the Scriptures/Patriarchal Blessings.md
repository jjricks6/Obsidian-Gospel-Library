 Blessings given to worthy Church members by ordained patriarchs. A patriarchal blessing contains the Lord's counsel for the person receiving the blessing and declares that person's lineage in the house of Israel. Fathers may give special blessings as the patriarchs of their families, but such blessings are not recorded or retained by the Church.
