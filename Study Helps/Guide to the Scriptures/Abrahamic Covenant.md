 Abraham received the gospel and was ordained to the higher priesthood ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-14|D&C 84:14]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-11|Abr. 2:11]]), and he entered into celestial marriage, which is the covenant of exaltation ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 131#^verse-1|D&C 131:1-4]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-19|132:19, 29]]). Abraham received a promise that all of the blessings of these covenants would be offered to his mortal posterity ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-29|D&C 132:29-31]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-6|Abr. 2:6-11]]). Together, these covenants and promises are called the Abrahamic covenant. The restoration of this covenant was the Restoration of the gospel in the last days, for through it all the nations of the earth are blessed ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3#^verse-8|Gal. 3:8-9, 29]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-12|D&C 110:12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 124#^verse-58|124:58]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-10|Abr. 2:10-11]]).
