 A banner raised by Moroni, chief commander of the Nephite armies in the Book of Mormon. Moroni made the banner to inspire the Nephite people to defend their religion, freedom, peace, and families.

 Moroni made the title of liberty out of his torn coat, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 46#^verse-12|Alma 46:12-13]].

 Those who would maintain the title entered into a covenant, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 46#^verse-20|Alma 46:20-22]].

 Moroni caused the title to be hoisted upon every tower, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 46#^verse-36|Alma 46:36]] ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 51#^verse-20|Alma 51:20]]).
