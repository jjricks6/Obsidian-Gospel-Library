 In ancient days, sacrifice meant to make something or someone holy. It has now come to mean to give up or suffer the loss of worldly things for the Lord and His kingdom. Members of the Lord's Church should be willing to sacrifice all things for the Lord. Joseph Smith taught that "a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has the power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation." In the eternal perspective, the blessings obtained by sacrifice are greater than anything that is given up.

 After Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden, the Lord gave them the law of sacrifice. This law included offering the firstborn of their flocks. This sacrifice symbolized the sacrifice that would be made by the Only Begotten Son of God ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 5#^verse-4|Moses 5:4-8]]). This practice continued until the death of Jesus Christ, which ended animal sacrifice as a gospel ordinance ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 34#^verse-13|Alma 34:13-14]]). In the Church today members partake of the sacrament of the bread and the water in remembrance of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Members of Christ's Church today are also asked to offer the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 9#^verse-19|3 Ne. 9:19-22]]). This means that they are humble, repentant, and willing to obey God's commandments.
