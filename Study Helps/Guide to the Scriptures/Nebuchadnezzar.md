 In the Old Testament, the king of Babylon (604-561 B.C.) who subdued Judah ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 24#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 24:1-4]]) and besieged Jerusalem ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 24#^verse-10|2 Kgs. 24:10-11]]). The prophet Lehi was commanded to flee Jerusalem in about 600 B.C. to avoid being taken captive to Babylon ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 1#^verse-4|1 Ne. 1:4-13]]) when Nebuchadnezzar carried away King Zedekiah and the people ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 25#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 25:1, 8-16, 20-22]]). Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dreams ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 2|Dan. 2]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 4|4]]).
