 God's reestablishment of the truths and ordinances of His gospel among men on earth. The gospel of Jesus Christ was lost from the earth through the apostasy that took place following the earthly ministry of Christ's Apostles. That apostasy made necessary the Restoration of the gospel. Through visions, the ministering of angels, and revelations to men on the earth, God restored the gospel. The Restoration started with the Prophet Joseph Smith ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History|JS—H 1]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-20|D&C 128:20-21]]) and has continued to the present through the work of the Lord's living prophets.
