 A reverent communication with God during which a person gives thanks and asks for blessings. Prayers are addressed to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. Prayers can be either spoken aloud or silent. A person's thoughts may also be a prayer if they are directed to God. A song of the righteous may be a prayer to God ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 25#^verse-12|D&C 25:12]]).

 The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that we must ask for in order to obtain.

 We pray to the Father in Christ's name ([[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-13|John 14:13-14]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-23|16:23-24]]). We are truly able to pray in Christ's name when our wishes are the wishes of Christ ([[New Testament/John/John 15#^verse-7|John 15:7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 46#^verse-30|D&C 46:30]]). We then ask for things that are right and thus possible for God to grant ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 18#^verse-20|3 Ne. 18:20]]). Some prayers remain unanswered because they in no way represent Christ's desire but spring instead out of the selfishness of man ([[New Testament/James/James 4#^verse-3|James 4:3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 46#^verse-9|D&C 46:9]]). Indeed, if we ask God for unrighteous things, it will turn to our condemnation ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-65|D&C 88:65]]).
