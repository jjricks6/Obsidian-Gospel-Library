 A form of an Aramaic and Hebrew word meaning "the anointed." In the New Testament Jesus is called the Christ, which is the Greek equivalent of Messiah. It means the anointed Prophet, Priest, King, and Deliverer whose coming the Jews were eagerly expecting.

 Many Jews were looking only for a deliverer from the Roman power and for a greater national prosperity; thus, when the Messiah came, the leaders and many others rejected Him. Only the humble and faithful were able to see in Jesus of Nazareth the true Christ ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 53|Isa. 53]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16#^verse-16|Matt. 16:16]]; [[New Testament/John/John 4#^verse-25|John 4:25-26]]).
