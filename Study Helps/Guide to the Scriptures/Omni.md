 A Nephite record keeper in the Book of Mormon who wrote in about 361 B.C. ([[Book of Mormon/Jarom#^verse-15|Jarom 1:15]]; [[Book of Mormon/Omni#^verse-1|Omni 1:1-3]]).

## The book of Omni

 A book translated from the small plates of Nephi in the Book of Mormon. The book has only a single chapter, which contains an account of the wars among the Nephites and Lamanites. Omni wrote only the [[Book of Mormon/Omni#^verse-1|first three verses]] of the book. The plates were then passed in turn to Amaron, Chemish, Abinadom, and finally Amaleki. Amaleki delivered the plates to King Benjamin, king of Zarahemla.
