 Means "may it be so" or "so it is." Amen is said to show hearty or solemn acceptance and agreement ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 27#^verse-14|Deut. 27:14-26]]) or truthfulness ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 1#^verse-36|1 Kgs. 1:36]]). Today at the end of prayers, testimonies, and talks, those who heard the prayer or message say an audible amen to indicate agreement and acceptance.

 In Old Testament times, a person was to say amen when making an oath ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 16#^verse-7|1 Chr. 16:7, 35-36]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 5#^verse-12|Neh. 5:12-13]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 8#^verse-2|8:2-6]]). Christ is called "the Amen, the faithful and true witness" ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 3#^verse-14|Rev. 3:14]]). Amen also served as the token of a covenant in the School of the Prophets ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-133|D&C 88:133-135]]).
