 The prophet chosen to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ to the earth. Joseph Smith was born in the state of Vermont in the United States of America and lived from 1805 to 1844.

 In 1820, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph, and he learned that none of the churches on the earth was true ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-1|JS—H 1:1-20]]). He was later visited by the angel Moroni, who revealed the hiding place of gold plates that contained the record of ancient peoples on the American continent ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-29|JS—H 1:29-54]]).

 Joseph translated the gold plates and in 1830 published them as the Book of Mormon ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-66|JS—H 1:66-67, 75]]). In 1829, he received priesthood authority from John the Baptist and from Peter, James, and John ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 13|D&C 13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-12|27:12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-20|128:20]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-68|JS—H 1:68-70]]).

 As directed by God, on April 6, 1830, Joseph and several others organized the restored Church of Jesus Christ ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-1|D&C 20:1-4]]). Under Joseph's leadership, the Church grew in Canada, England, and the eastern portion of the United States, especially in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. Serious persecution followed Joseph and the Saints wherever they settled. On June 27, 1844, Joseph and his brother Hyrum were martyred in Carthage, Illinois, in the United States of America.

 Joseph, son of Jacob, prophesied of Joseph Smith, [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 3#^verse-6|2 Ne. 3:6-15]].

 Because of His knowledge of coming calamity, the Lord called his servant Joseph Smith, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 1#^verse-17|D&C 1:17]] ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 19#^verse-13|D&C 19:13]]).

 Joseph Smith was ordained an Apostle of Jesus Christ and first elder of this Church, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-2|D&C 20:2]].

 Joseph was ordained to the apostleship by Peter, James, and John, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-12|D&C 27:12]].

 Joseph and Sidney Rigdon testified that they saw the Only Begotten of the Father, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-23|D&C 76:23]].

 With Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith saw the Lord in vision, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-1|D&C 110:1-4]].

 The Lord called Joseph as presiding elder, translator, revelator, seer, and prophet, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 124#^verse-125|D&C 124:125]].

 Joseph Smith has done more for the salvation of men than any other man, save Jesus only, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 135#^verse-3|D&C 135:3]].

## Scripture brought forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith

 Joseph translated portions of the gold plates that were given him by the angel Moroni, which translation was published in 1830 as the Book of Mormon. He also received many revelations from the Lord outlining the basic doctrines and organization of the Church. Many of these revelations were compiled in what is now known as the Doctrine and Covenants. He was also responsible for bringing forth the Pearl of Great Price, containing inspired translations of some of the writings of Moses, Abraham, and Matthew, excerpts from his personal history and testimony, and thirteen statements of doctrine and belief held by the Church.
