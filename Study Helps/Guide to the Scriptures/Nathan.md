 An Old Testament prophet at the time of King David. When David offered to build a temple for the Lord, the Lord instructed Nathan to tell David he was not to build it. Nathan also rebuked David for causing the death of Uriah, one of his warriors, and for taking Uriah's wife, Bathsheba ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 12#^verse-1|2 Sam. 12:1-15]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-38|D&C 132:38-39]]). Zadok, with Nathan, anointed David's son Solomon king ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 1#^verse-38|1 Kgs. 1:38-39, 45]]).
