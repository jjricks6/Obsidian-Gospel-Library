 Christ (a Greek word) and Messiah (a Hebrew word) mean "the anointed." Jesus Christ is the Firstborn of the Father in the spirit ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 1#^verse-6|Heb. 1:6]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-21|D&C 93:21]]). He is the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh ([[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-14|John 1:14]]; [[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-16|3:16]]). He is Jehovah ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-3|D&C 110:3-4]]) and was foreordained to His great calling before the creation of the world. Under the direction of the Father, Jesus created the earth and everything on it ([[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-3|John 1:3, 14]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 1#^verse-31|Moses 1:31-33]]). He was born to Mary at Bethlehem, lived a sinless life, and made a perfect atonement for the sins of all mankind by the shedding of His blood and giving His life on the cross ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 2#^verse-1|Matt. 2:1]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 11#^verse-13|1 Ne. 11:13-33]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 27#^verse-13|3 Ne. 27:13-16]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-40|D&C 76:40-42]]). He rose from the dead, thus assuring the eventual resurrection of all mankind. Through Jesus' Atonement and Resurrection, those who repent of their sins and obey God's commandments can live eternally with Jesus and the Father ([[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 9#^verse-10|2 Ne. 9:10-12]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 21|21-22]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-50|D&C 76:50-53, 62]]).

 Jesus Christ is the greatest being to be born on this earth. His life is the perfect example of how all mankind should live. All prayers, blessings, and priesthood ordinances should be done in His name. He is the Lord of lords, King of kings, the Creator, the Savior, and the God of the whole earth.

 Jesus Christ will come again in power and glory to reign on the earth during the Millennium. At the last day, He will judge all mankind ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 11#^verse-40|Alma 11:40-41]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—Matthew|JS—M 1]]).
