 In the New Testament, one of the original Twelve Apostles chosen by the Savior during His mortal ministry ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 10#^verse-2|Matt. 10:2-3]]; [[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-5|John 14:5]]). In Greek the name is Didymus ([[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-24|John 20:24-29]]; [[New Testament/John/John 21#^verse-2|21:2]]). Though Thomas doubted Jesus' Resurrection until he personally saw the Savior, his strength of character made him willing to face persecution and death with his Lord ([[New Testament/John/John 11#^verse-16|John 11:16]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-19|20:19-25]]).
