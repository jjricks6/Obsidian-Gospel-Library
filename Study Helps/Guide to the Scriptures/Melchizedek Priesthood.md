 The Melchizedek Priesthood is the higher or greater priesthood; the Aaronic Priesthood is the lesser priesthood. The Melchizedek Priesthood includes the keys of the spiritual blessings of the Church. Through the ordinances of the higher priesthood the power of godliness is made manifest to men ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-18|D&C 84:18-25]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-18|107:18-21]]).

 God first revealed this higher priesthood to Adam. The patriarchs and prophets in every dispensation had this authority ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-6|D&C 84:6-17]]). It was first called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God.

These were called the Aaronic Priesthood and the law of Moses. When Jesus came to the earth, He restored the Melchizedek Priesthood to the Jews and began to build up the Church among them. However, the priesthood and the Church were lost again through apostasy. They were later restored through Joseph Smith Jr. ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-12|D&C 27:12-13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-20|128:20]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-73|JS—H 1:73]]).
