 A book in the New Testament. It was originally a letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Saints living throughout Galatia. The theme of this letter is that true freedom can be found only in living the gospel of Jesus Christ. If the Saints adopted the teachings of Jewish Christians who insisted on observing the Mosaic law, they would limit or destroy the freedom they had found in Christ. In the epistle Paul established his own position as an Apostle, explained the doctrine of righteousness by faith, and affirmed the value of a spiritual religion.

 In [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1|chapters 1 and 2]], Paul expressed regret at the news he had received of apostasy among the Galatians and clarified his position among the Apostles. [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3|Chapters 3 and 4]] discuss the doctrines of faith and works. [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 5|Chapters 5 and 6]] contain a sermon on the practical results of the doctrine of faith.
