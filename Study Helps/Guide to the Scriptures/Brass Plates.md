 A record of the Jews from the beginning to 600 B.C., containing many writings of the prophets ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5#^verse-10|1 Ne. 5:10-16]]). This record was kept by Laban, one of the Jewish elders in Jerusalem. While Lehi and his family were in the wilderness, Lehi sent his sons back to Jerusalem to obtain this record ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 3|1 Ne. 3-4]]). (For further information, see "[[Book of Mormon/Breif Explanation about the Book of Mormon|A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon]]," which is in the Book of Mormon.)
