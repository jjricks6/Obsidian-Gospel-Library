## The book of Habakkuk

 [[Old Testament/Habakkuk/Habakkuk 1|Chapter 1]] is a discussion between the Lord and His prophet, similar to those in [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 12|Jeremiah 12]] and [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 121|Doctrine and Covenants 121]]. Habakkuk was troubled that the wicked seem to prosper. In [[Old Testament/Habakkuk/Habakkuk 2|chapter 2]] the Lord counseled Habakkuk to be patientâ€”the just must learn to live by faith. [[Old Testament/Habakkuk/Habakkuk 3|Chapter 3]] records Habakkuk's prayer in which he acknowledged God's justice.
