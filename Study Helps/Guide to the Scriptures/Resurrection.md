 The reuniting of the spirit body with the physical body of flesh and bones after death. After resurrection, the spirit and body will never again be separated, and the person will become immortal. Every person born on earth will be resurrected because Jesus Christ overcame death ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-20|1 Cor. 15:20-22]]).

 Jesus Christ was the first person to be resurrected on this earth ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-23|Acts 26:23]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 1#^verse-18|Col. 1:18]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 1#^verse-5|Rev. 1:5]]). The New Testament gives ample evidence that Jesus rose with His physical body: His tomb was empty, He ate fish and honey, He had a body of flesh and bones, people touched Him, and the angels said He had risen ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 16#^verse-1|Mark 16:1-6]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 24#^verse-1|Luke 24:1-12, 36-43]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-1|John 20:1-18]]). Latter-day revelation confirms the reality of the Resurrection of Christ and of all mankind ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 11#^verse-40|Alma 11:40-45]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 40|40]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 11#^verse-1|3 Ne. 11:1-17]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76|D&C 76]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-62|Moses 7:62]]).

 All people will not be resurrected to the same glory ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-39|1 Cor. 15:39-42]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-89|D&C 76:89-98]]), nor will all be resurrected at the same time ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-22|1 Cor. 15:22-23]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 40#^verse-8|Alma 40:8]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-64|D&C 76:64-65, 85]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-96|88:96-102]]). Many Saints were resurrected after Christ's Resurrection ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-52|Matt. 27:52]]). The righteous will be resurrected before the wicked and will come forth in the First Resurrection ([[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 4#^verse-16|1 Thes. 4:16]]); the unrepentant sinners will come forth in the last resurrection ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 20#^verse-5|Rev. 20:5-13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-85|D&C 76:85]]).
