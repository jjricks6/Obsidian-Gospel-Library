 The four records or testimonies of Jesus' mortal life and the events pertaining to His ministry contained in the first four books of the New Testament. Written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, they are recorded witnesses of Christ's life. The book of 3 Nephi in the Book of Mormon is similar in many ways to these four New Testament Gospels.

 The books of the New Testament were originally written in Greek. The Greek word for gospel means "good news." The good news is that Jesus Christ has made an atonement that will redeem all mankind from death and reward each individual according to his works ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-16|John 3:16]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 5#^verse-10|Rom. 5:10-11]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 9#^verse-26|2 Ne. 9:26]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 34#^verse-9|Alma 34:9]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-69|D&C 76:69]]).
