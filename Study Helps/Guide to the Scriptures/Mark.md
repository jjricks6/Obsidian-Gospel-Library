 In the New Testament, John Mark was the son of Mary, who lived in Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-12|Acts 12:12]]); he may also have been the cousin (or nephew) of Barnabas ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-10|Col. 4:10]]). He went with Paul and Barnabas from Jerusalem on their first missionary journey and left them at Perga ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-25|Acts 12:25]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-5|13:5, 13]]). Later he accompanied Barnabas to Cyprus ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-37|Acts 15:37-39]]). He was with Paul at Rome ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-10|Col. 4:10]]; [[New Testament/Philemon#^verse-24|Philem. 1:24]]), and he was with Peter at Babylon (probably at Rome) ([[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 5#^verse-13|1 Pet. 5:13]]). Finally, he was with Timothy at Ephesus ([[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-11|2 Tim. 4:11]]).

## The Gospel of Mark

 The second book in the New Testament. Mark's gospel was possibly written under Peter's direction. His object is to describe the Lord as the Son of God living and acting among men. Mark describes, with energy and humility, the impression Jesus made upon bystanders. Tradition states that after Peter's death, Mark visited Egypt, organized the Church in Alexandria, and died by martyrdom.
