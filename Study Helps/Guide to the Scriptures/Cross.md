 The wooden structure upon which Jesus Christ was crucified ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 15#^verse-20|Mark 15:20-26]]). Many in the world now think of it as a symbol of Christ's Crucifixion and atoning sacrifice; however, the Lord has established His own symbols for His Crucifixion and sacrificeâ€”the bread and the water of the sacrament ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-26|Matt. 26:26-28]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-40|D&C 20:40, 75-79]]).
