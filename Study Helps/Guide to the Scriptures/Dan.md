 In the Old Testament, a son of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel's maid ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 30#^verse-5|Gen. 30:5-6]]).

## The tribe of Dan

 For Jacob's blessing on Dan, see [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-16|Genesis 49:16-18]]. For Moses' blessing on the tribe of Dan, see [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-22|Deuteronomy 33:22]]. After they settled in Canaan, the tribe of Dan received a small but extremely fertile piece of land ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 19#^verse-40|Josh. 19:40-48]]). They had a good deal of difficulty protecting it against the Amorites ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 1#^verse-34|Judg. 1:34]]) and against the Philistines ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 13#^verse-2|Judg. 13:2, 25]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18#^verse-1|18:1]]). As a result, the Danites moved north of Palestine ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18|Judg. 18]]), around Laish, and renamed that city Dan. This town is well known as the northern limit of Palestine, which extended "from Dan even to Beer-sheba."
