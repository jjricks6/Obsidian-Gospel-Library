 A righteous king of the nation of Judah in the Old Testament. He reigned for twenty-nine years, during the time that Isaiah was the prophet in Judah ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18|2 Kgs. 18-20]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29|2 Chr. 29-32]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 36|Isa. 36-39]]). Isaiah assisted him in reforming both church and state. He suppressed idolatry and reinstated the temple services. Hezekiah's life was extended fifteen years through prayer and faith ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 20#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 20:1-7]]). The early part of his reign was prosperous, but his rebellion against the king of Assyria ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 18:7]]) resulted in two Assyrian invasions: the first is described in [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 10#^verse-24|Isaiah 10:24-32]], the second in [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-13|2 Kings 18:13-19:7]]. In the second invasion, Jerusalem was saved by an angel of the Lord ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 19#^verse-35|2 Kgs. 19:35]]).
