 In the Old Testament, the Lord revealed to Moses and the ancient Israelites that only certain foods were considered clean or, in other words, fit to be eaten. The distinction that the Israelites drew between clean and unclean foods had a great effect upon their religious and social life. Certain animals, birds, and fish were regarded as clean and acceptable to eat, while others were unclean and were forbidden ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 11|Lev. 11]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 14#^verse-3|Deut. 14:3-20]]). Some diseased persons were also considered unclean.

 In a spiritual sense, to be clean is to be free from sin and sinful desires. In this sense the word is used to describe a person who is virtuous and has a pure heart ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 24#^verse-4|Ps. 24:4]]). God's covenant people have always had special instructions to be clean ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 20#^verse-41|3 Ne. 20:41]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 38#^verse-42|D&C 38:42]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 133#^verse-5|133:5]]).

 He that hath clean hands and a pure heart shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord, [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 24#^verse-3|Ps. 24:3-5]].

 Do not call any man common or unclean, [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10#^verse-11|Acts 10:11-28]].

 Can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands, [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 5#^verse-19|Alma 5:19]].

 The Lord will chasten Zion until she is clean, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 90#^verse-36|D&C 90:36]].

 Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 133#^verse-4|D&C 133:4-5, 14]] ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 52#^verse-11|Isa. 52:11]]).
