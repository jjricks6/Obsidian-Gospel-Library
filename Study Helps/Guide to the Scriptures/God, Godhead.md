 There are three separate persons in the Godhead: God, the Eternal Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost. We believe in each of Them ([[Pearl of Great Price/Articles of Faith#^verse-1|A of F 1:1]]). From latter-day revelation we learn that the Father and the Son have tangible bodies of flesh and bone and that the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, without flesh and bone ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 130#^verse-22|D&C 130:22-23]]). These three persons are one in perfect unity and harmony of purpose and doctrine ([[New Testament/John/John 17#^verse-21|John 17:21-23]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 31#^verse-21|2 Ne. 31:21]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 11#^verse-27|3 Ne. 11:27, 36]]).

## God the Father

 It is generally the Father, or Elohim, who is referred to by the title God. He is called the Father because He is the father of our spirits ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 16#^verse-22|Num. 16:22]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 27#^verse-16|27:16]]; [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 2#^verse-10|Mal. 2:10]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-9|Matt. 6:9]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 4#^verse-6|Eph. 4:6]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12#^verse-9|Heb. 12:9]]). God the Father is the supreme ruler of the universe. He is all powerful ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 18#^verse-14|Gen. 18:14]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 26#^verse-35|Alma 26:35]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 19#^verse-1|D&C 19:1-3]]), all knowing ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-8|Matt. 6:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-24|2 Ne. 2:24]]), and everywhere present through His Spirit ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 139#^verse-7|Ps. 139:7-12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-7|D&C 88:7-13, 41]]). Mankind has a special relationship to God that sets man apart from all other created things: men and women are God's spirit children ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 82#^verse-6|Ps. 82:6]]; [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 3#^verse-1|1 Jn. 3:1-3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-17|D&C 20:17-18]]).

 There are few recorded instances of God the Father appearing to or speaking to man. The scriptures say that He spoke to Adam and Eve ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 4#^verse-14|Moses 4:14-31]]) and introduced Jesus Christ on several occasions ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 3#^verse-17|Matt. 3:17]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-5|17:5]]; [[New Testament/John/John 12#^verse-28|John 12:28-29]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 11#^verse-3|3 Ne. 11:3-7]]). He appeared to Stephen ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-55|Acts 7:55-56]]) and Joseph Smith ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-17|JS—H 1:17]]). Later He appeared to both Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-20|D&C 76:20, 23]]). To those who love God and purify themselves before Him, God sometimes grants the privilege of seeing and knowing for themselves that He is God ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-8|Matt. 5:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 12#^verse-8|3 Ne. 12:8]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-116|D&C 76:116-118]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-1|93:1]]).

## God the Son

 The God known as Jehovah is the Son, Jesus Christ ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 12#^verse-2|Isa. 12:2]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 43#^verse-11|43:11]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 49#^verse-26|49:26]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 10#^verse-1|1 Cor. 10:1-4]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1#^verse-1|1 Tim. 1:1]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 1#^verse-8|Rev. 1:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 22#^verse-2|2 Ne. 22:2]]). Jesus works under the direction of the Father and is in complete harmony with Him. All mankind are His brothers and sisters, for He is the eldest of the spirit children of Elohim. Some scripture references refer to Him by the word God. For example, the scripture says that "God created the heaven and the earth" ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 1#^verse-1|Gen. 1:1]]), but it was actually Jesus who was the Creator under the direction of God the Father ([[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-1|John 1:1-3, 10, 14]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 1#^verse-1|Heb. 1:1-2]]).

## God the Holy Ghost

 The Holy Ghost is also a God and is called the Holy Spirit, the Spirit, and the Spirit of God, among other similar names and titles. With the aid of the Holy Ghost, man can know the will of God the Father and know that Jesus is the Christ ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 12#^verse-3|1 Cor. 12:3]]).

 The Holy Ghost will teach you what you should say, [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12#^verse-12|Luke 12:12]].
