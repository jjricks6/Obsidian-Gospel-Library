 The main character of the book of Daniel in the Old Testament; a prophet of God and a man of great faith.

 Nothing is known about his parents, although he appears to have been of royal descent ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-3|Dan. 1:3]]). He was taken captive to Babylon, where he received the name Belteshazzar ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-6|Dan. 1:6-7]]). Daniel and three other captives refused the king's food for religious reasons ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-8|Dan. 1:8-16]]).

 Daniel won the favor of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius by his power to interpret dreams ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 2|Dan. 2]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 4|4]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6|6]]). He also read and interpreted the handwriting on the wall ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 5|Dan. 5]]). His enemies plotted against him, and he was thrown into a den of lions, but the Lord preserved his life ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6|Dan. 6]]).

## The book of Daniel

 The book has two divisions: [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1|chapters 1-6]] are stories about Daniel and his three companions; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 7|chapters 7-12]] are prophetic visions that Daniel saw. The book teaches the importance of being true to God and illustrates that the Lord blesses the faithful.

 A major contribution of the book is the interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream. In the dream, the kingdom of God in the last days is depicted as a stone that is cut out of a mountain. The stone will roll forth until it fills the whole earth ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 2|Dan. 2]]; see also [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 65#^verse-2|D&C 65:2]]).
