 Speaking disrespectfully or irreverently of God or sacred things.

 Jesus was charged several times by the Jews with speaking blasphemy because He claimed the right to forgive sins ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-2|Matt. 9:2-3]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-20|Luke 5:20-21]]), because He called Himself the Son of God ([[New Testament/John/John 10#^verse-22|John 10:22-36]]; [[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-7|19:7]]), and because He said they would see Him sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-64|Matt. 26:64-65]]). These charges would have been true if He had not actually been all that He said He was. The charge brought against Him by the false witnesses at the trial before the Sanhedrin ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-59|Matt. 26:59-61]]) was of blasphemy against God's temple. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which is willfully denying Christ after having received a perfect knowledge of Him, is the unforgivable sin ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 12#^verse-31|Matt. 12:31-32]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 3#^verse-28|Mark 3:28-29]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-27|D&C 132:27]]).

 He that blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death, [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 24#^verse-11|Lev. 24:11-16]].

 The Lord's enemies will not be left to blaspheme his name, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 105#^verse-15|D&C 105:15]].

 Vengeance will come upon those who blaspheme against the Lord, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 112#^verse-24|D&C 112:24-26]].
