 In the New Testament, Peter was originally known as Simeon or Simon ([[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 1#^verse-1|2 Pet. 1:1]]), a fisherman of Bethsaida living at Capernaum with his wife. Jesus healed Peter's wife's mother ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-29|Mark 1:29-31]]). Peter was called with his brother Andrew to be a disciple of Jesus Christ ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4#^verse-18|Matt. 4:18-22]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-16|Mark 1:16-18]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-1|Luke 5:1-11]]). His Aramaic name, Cephas, meaning "a seer" or "stone," was given to him by the Lord ([[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-40|John 1:40-42]]; [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, John/JST, John 1#^verse-42|JST, John 1:42 [Appendix]]]). While the New Testament mentions some of Peter's mortal weaknesses, it also illustrates that he overcame them and was made strong by his faith in Jesus Christ.

 Peter confessed that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God ([[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-68|John 6:68-69]]), and the Lord selected him to hold the keys of the kingdom on earth ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16#^verse-13|Matt. 16:13-19]]). On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter saw the transfigured Savior, as well as Moses and Elias (Elijah) ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-1|Matt. 17:1-9]]).

 Peter was the chief Apostle of his day. After the death, Resurrection, and Ascension of the Savior, he called the Church together and directed the calling of an Apostle to replace Judas Iscariot ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1#^verse-15|Acts 1:15-26]]). Peter and John healed a man who was lame from birth ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3#^verse-1|Acts 3:1-16]]) and were miraculously released from prison ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 5#^verse-11|Acts 5:11-29]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-1|12:1-19]]). It was through Peter's ministry that the gospel was first opened to the Gentiles ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10|Acts 10-11]]). In the latter days, Peter, with James and John, came from heaven and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood and the keys thereof upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-12|D&C 27:12-13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-20|128:20]]).

## First epistle of Peter

 The first epistle was written from "Babylon" (probably Rome) and was sent to the Saints in what is now called Asia Minor soon after Nero began persecuting the Christians.

 [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 1|Chapter 1]] speaks of Christ's foreordained role as the Redeemer. [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 2|Chapters 2-3]] explain that Christ is the chief cornerstone of the Church, that the Saints hold a royal priesthood, and that Christ preached to the spirits in prison. [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4|Chapters 4-5]] explain why the gospel is preached to the dead and why the elders must feed the flock.

## Second epistle of Peter

 [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 1|Chapter 1]] exhorts the Saints to make their calling and election sure. [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 2|Chapter 2]] warns against false teachers. [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 3|Chapter 3]] speaks of the latter days and Christ's Second Coming.
