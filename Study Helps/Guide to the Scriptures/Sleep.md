 A state of rest in which a person is inactive and unconscious. The Lord has counseled His Saints to not sleep longer than is needful ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-124|D&C 88:124]]). Sleep can also be a symbol for spiritual death ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11#^verse-30|1 Cor. 11:30]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 1#^verse-13|2 Ne. 1:13]]) or for physical death ([[Book of Mormon/Mormon/Mormon 9#^verse-13|Morm. 9:13]]).
