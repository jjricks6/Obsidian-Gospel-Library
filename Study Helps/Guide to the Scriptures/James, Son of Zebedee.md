 One of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus during His mortal ministry. He was the brother of John. He was one of three Apostles chosen to be with Jesus on certain special occasions: at the raising of the daughter of Jairus ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 5#^verse-37|Mark 5:37]]), at the Transfiguration ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-1|Matt. 17:1]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-2|Mark 9:2]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 9#^verse-28|Luke 9:28]]), and at Gethsemane ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-37|Matt. 26:37]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 14#^verse-33|Mark 14:33]]).
