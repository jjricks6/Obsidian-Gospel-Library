 An oath is a sworn affirmation to be true and faithful to one's promises. A covenant is a solemn promise between two parties. The Aaronic Priesthood is received by covenant alone. Melchizedek Priesthood holders receive the priesthood by unspoken oath as well as by covenant. As priesthood holders are faithful and magnify their callings as God directs, He blesses them. Those who are faithful to the end and do all He asks of them will receive all that the Father has ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-33|D&C 84:33-39]]).
