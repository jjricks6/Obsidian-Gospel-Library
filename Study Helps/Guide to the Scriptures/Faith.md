 Confidence in something or someone. As most often used in the scriptures, faith is confidence and trust in Jesus Christ that lead a person to obey Him. Faith must be centered in Jesus Christ in order for it to lead a person to salvation. Latter-day Saints also have faith in God the Father, the Holy Ghost, priesthood power, and other important aspects of the restored gospel.

 Faith includes a hope for things which are not seen, but which are true ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-1|Heb. 11:1]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 32#^verse-21|Alma 32:21]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 12#^verse-6|Ether 12:6]]). Faith is kindled by hearing the gospel taught by authorized administrators sent by God ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10#^verse-14|Rom. 10:14-17]]). Miracles do not produce faith, but strong faith is developed by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In other words, faith comes by righteousness ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 32#^verse-40|Alma 32:40-43]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 12#^verse-4|Ether 12:4, 6, 12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 63#^verse-9|D&C 63:9-12]]).

 True faith brings miracles, visions, dreams, healings, and all the gifts of God that He gives to His Saints. By faith one obtains a remission of sins and eventually is able to dwell in God's presence. A lack of faith leads one to despair, which comes because of iniquity ([[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 10#^verse-22|Moro. 10:22]]).
