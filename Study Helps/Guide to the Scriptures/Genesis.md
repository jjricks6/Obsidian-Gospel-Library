 The book of Genesis is the first book of the Old Testament and was written by the prophet Moses. It gives an account of many beginnings, such as the creation of the earth, the placing of animals and man on the earth, the Fall of Adam and Eve, the revelation of the gospel to Adam, the beginning of tribes and races, the origin of various languages at Babel, and the beginning of the Abrahamic family leading to the establishment of the house of Israel. Joseph's role as a preserver of Israel is emphasized in Genesis.

 Latter-day revelation verifies and clarifies the record of Genesis ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5|1 Ne. 5]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 1|Ether 1]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 1|Moses 1-8]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 1|Abr. 1-5]]).
