 The last Jaredite prophet in the Book of Mormon ([[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 12#^verse-1|Ether 12:1-2]]).

## The book of Ether

 A book in the Book of Mormon that contains portions of the record of the Jaredites. The Jaredites were a group of people who lived in the western hemisphere many centuries before the people of Lehi. The book of Ether was taken from twenty-four plates found by the people of Limhi ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 8#^verse-8|Mosiah 8:8-9]]).

 [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 1|Chapters 1-2]] tell how the Jaredites left their home at the time of the Tower of Babel and began their journey to what is now known as the American continent. [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 3|Chapters 3-6]] explain that the brother of Jared saw the premortal Savior and that the Jaredites traveled in eight barges. [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 7|Chapters 7-11]] continue the history of wickedness that dominated much of Jaredite history. Moroni, who edited Ether's record, wrote in [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 12|chapters 12-13]] of wonders done by faith and of Christ and a New Jerusalem to come. [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 14|Chapters 14-15]] tell how the Jaredites became a mighty nation but were destroyed by civil war due to wickedness.
