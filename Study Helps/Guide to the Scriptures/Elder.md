 The term elder is used in various ways in the Bible. In the Old Testament it often refers to the older men in a tribe, who were usually entrusted with governmental affairs ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 50#^verse-7|Gen. 50:7]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 20#^verse-4|Josh. 20:4]]; [[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 4#^verse-2|Ruth 4:2]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 15#^verse-2|Matt. 15:2]]). Their age and experience made their counsel valuable. Their position was not necessarily a priesthood calling.

 There were also ordained elders in the Melchizedek Priesthood in Old Testament times ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-9|Ex. 24:9-11]]). In the New Testament, elders are mentioned as a priesthood office in the Church ([[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-14|James 5:14-15]]). Among the Nephites there were also ordained elders in the priesthood ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 4#^verse-7|Alma 4:7, 16]]; [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 3#^verse-1|Moro. 3:1]]). In this dispensation, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were the first elders to be ordained ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-2|D&C 20:2-3]]).

 Elder is now the title given to all holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood. For example, male missionaries are addressed as elders. Also, an Apostle is an elder, and it is proper to speak of members of the Quorum of the Twelve or Quorums of the Seventy by this title ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-38|D&C 20:38]]; [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 5#^verse-1|1 Pet. 5:1]]). The duties of ordained elders in the Church today have been given in latter-day revelation ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-38|D&C 20:38-45]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 42#^verse-44|42:44]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 46#^verse-2|46:2]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-12|107:12]]).
