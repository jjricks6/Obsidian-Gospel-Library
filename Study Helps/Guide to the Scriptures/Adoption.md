 The scriptures speak of two types of adoption.

 (1) A person who is of non-Israelite lineage becomes a member of the family of Abraham and the house of Israel by having faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized by immersion, and receiving the Holy Ghost ([[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 31#^verse-17|2 Ne. 31:17-18]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-73|D&C 84:73-74]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-6|Abr. 2:6, 10-11]]).

 (2) All who have received the saving ordinances of the gospel become sons and daughters of Jesus Christ by continued obedience to His commandments ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-15|Rom. 8:15-17]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3#^verse-24|Gal. 3:24-29]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-5|4:5-7]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 5#^verse-7|Mosiah 5:7-8]]).
