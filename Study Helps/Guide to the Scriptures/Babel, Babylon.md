 The capital of Babylonia.

 Babel was founded by Nimrod and was one of the oldest cities in the land of Mesopotamia, or Shinar ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10#^verse-8|Gen. 10:8-10]]). The Lord confounded the language at the time the people were building the Tower of Babel ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 11#^verse-1|Gen. 11:1-9]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 1#^verse-3|Ether 1:3-5, 33-35]]). Babylon later became Nebuchadnezzar's capital. He built an enormous city of which the ruins still remain. Babylon became a very wicked city and has since come to symbolize the wickedness of the world.
