 A Nephite prophet and record keeper in the Book of Mormon who prayed for and received a remission of his sins through his faith in Christ ([[Book of Mormon/Enos#^verse-1|Enos 1:1-8]]). The Lord covenanted with Enos to bring forth the Book of Mormon to the Lamanites ([[Book of Mormon/Enos#^verse-15|Enos 1:15-17]]).

## The book of Enos

 A book in the Book of Mormon that tells of Enos's prayer to the Lord for personal forgiveness, for his people, and for others. The Lord promised him that the Book of Mormon would be preserved and made available to the Lamanites in a future day. Though the book contains but one chapter, it records the powerful story of a man who sought his God in prayer, lived obedient to God's commands, and before his death rejoiced in his knowledge of the Redeemer.
