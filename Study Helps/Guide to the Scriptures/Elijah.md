 An Old Testament prophet who returned in the latter days to confer the keys of the sealing power on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. In his day, Elijah ministered in the Northern Kingdom of Israel ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 17|1 Kgs. 17-22]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 1|2 Kgs. 1-2]]). He had great faith in the Lord and is noted for many miracles. At his request, God prevented rain for 3Â½ years. He raised a boy from the dead and called down fire from heaven ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 17|1 Kgs. 17-18]]). The Jewish people still wait for Elijah to return, as Malachi prophesied he would ([[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4#^verse-5|Mal. 4:5]]). He remains an invited guest at Jewish Passover Feasts, where an open door and a vacant seat always await him.

 The Prophet Joseph Smith said that Elijah held the sealing power of the Melchizedek Priesthood and was the last prophet to do so before the time of Jesus Christ. He appeared on the Mount of Transfiguration with Moses and conferred the keys of the priesthood on Peter, James, and John ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-3|Matt. 17:3]]). He appeared again, with Moses and others, on April 3, 1836, in the Kirtland Ohio Temple and conferred the same keys upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-13|D&C 110:13-16]]). All of this was in preparation for the Second Coming of the Lord, as spoken of in [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4#^verse-5|Malachi 4:5-6]].

 The power of Elijah is the sealing power of the priesthood by which things that are bound or loosed on earth are bound or loosed in heaven ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-8|D&C 128:8-18]]). Chosen servants of the Lord on earth today have this sealing power and perform the saving ordinances of the gospel for the living and the dead ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-8|D&C 128:8]]).

 Sealed the heavens and was fed by ravens, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 17#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 17:1-7]].

 Commanded the widow's barrel of meal and cruse of oil not to fail, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 17#^verse-8|1 Kgs. 17:8-16]].

 Raised the widow's son from death, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 17#^verse-17|1 Kgs. 17:17-24]].

 Defeated the priests of Baal, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-21|1 Kgs. 18:21-39]].

 The still small voice spoke to him, [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 19#^verse-11|1 Kgs. 19:11-12]].

 Ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire, [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2#^verse-11|2 Kgs. 2:11]].

 Malachi prophesied of his return in the latter days, [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4#^verse-5|Mal. 4:5-6]] ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 25#^verse-5|3 Ne. 25:5]]).

 Appeared in the Kirtland Ohio Temple in 1836, [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-13|D&C 110:13-16]].
