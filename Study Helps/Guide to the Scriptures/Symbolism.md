 To use something as a likeness or image of another thing. Symbolism in the scriptures uses a familiar object, event, or circumstance to represent a principle or teaching of the gospel. For example, the Book of Mormon prophet Alma used a seed to represent the word of God ([[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 32|Alma 32]]).

 Prophets throughout the scriptures used symbolism to teach about Jesus Christ. Some of these symbols include ceremonies and ordinances ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-63|Moses 6:63]]), sacrifices ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9#^verse-11|Heb. 9:11-15]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 5#^verse-7|Moses 5:7-8]]), the sacrament ([[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Mark/JST, Mark 14#^verse-20|JST, Mark 14:20-24 [Appendix]]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-13|Luke 22:13-20]]), and baptism ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 6#^verse-1|Rom. 6:1-6]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-12|D&C 128:12-13]]). Many biblical names are symbolic. The Old Testament tabernacle ceremony and the law of Moses represented eternal truths ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 8|Heb. 8-10]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 13#^verse-29|Mosiah 13:29-32]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 25#^verse-15|Alma 25:15]]; [[Book of Mormon/Helaman/Helaman 8#^verse-14|Hel. 8:14-15]]). For other examples, see [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-13|Matthew 5:13-16]]; [[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-14|John 3:14-15]]; [[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 4#^verse-5|Jacob 4:5]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-38|Alma 37:38-45]].
