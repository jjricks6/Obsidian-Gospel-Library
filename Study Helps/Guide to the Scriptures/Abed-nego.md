 In the Old Testament, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were three Israelite youths who, along with Daniel, were brought into the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Abed-nego's Hebrew name was Azariah. The four young men refused to defile themselves by partaking of the king's meat and wine ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1|Dan. 1]]). Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were thrown into a fiery furnace by the king but were miraculously preserved ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 3|Dan. 3]]).
