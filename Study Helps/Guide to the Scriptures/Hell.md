 Latter-day revelation speaks of hell in at least two senses. First, it is the temporary abode in the spirit world for those who were disobedient in mortality. In this sense, hell has an end. The spirits there will be taught the gospel, and sometime following their repentance they will be resurrected to a degree of glory of which they are worthy. Those who will not repent, but are nevertheless not sons of perdition, will remain in hell throughout the Millennium. After these thousand years of torment, they will be resurrected to a telestial glory ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-81|D&C 76:81-86]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-100|88:100-101]]).

 Second, it is the permanent location of those who are not redeemed by the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In this sense, hell is permanent. It is for those who are found "filthy still" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-35|D&C 88:35, 102]]). This is the place where Satan, his angels, and the sons of perdition—those who have denied the Son after the Father has revealed Him—will dwell eternally ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-43|D&C 76:43-46]]).

 The scriptures sometimes refer to hell as outer darkness.
