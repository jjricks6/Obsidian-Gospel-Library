 The token of the Abrahamic covenant for male Israelites during Old Testament dispensations ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 17#^verse-10|Gen. 17:10-11, 23-27]]; [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 17#^verse-11|JST, Gen. 17:11 [Appendix]]]). Circumcision was performed by cutting off the "flesh of the foreskin" of male infants and adults alike. Those who received it enjoyed the privileges and accepted the responsibilities of the covenant. Circumcision as a token of the covenant was done away with by Christ's mission ([[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 8#^verse-8|Moro. 8:8]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 74#^verse-3|D&C 74:3-7]]).
