 In the Old Testament, the firstborn son of Jacob and Rachel ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 30#^verse-22|Gen. 30:22-24]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 37#^verse-3|37:3]]).

 Joseph obtained the birthright in Israel because Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob's first wife, lost the privilege by transgression ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-1|1 Chr. 5:1-2]]). Because he was worthy, Joseph, as the firstborn son of Jacob's second wife, was next in line for the blessing. Joseph also received a blessing from his father shortly before Jacob died ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-22|Gen. 49:22-26]]).

 Joseph was a man of great character, an individual "discreet and wise" ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 41#^verse-39|Gen. 41:39]]). His rejection of Potiphar's wife is an example of faith, chastity, and personal integrity ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 39#^verse-7|Gen. 39:7-12]]). In Egypt, when Joseph revealed his true identity to his brothers, he thanked instead of blamed them for how they had treated him. He believed their actions had helped to accomplish God's divine will ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 45#^verse-4|Gen. 45:4-15]]).

 Latter-day revelation reveals the larger mission of the family of Joseph in the last days ([[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 50#^verse-24|JST, Gen. 50:24-38 [Appendix]]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 3#^verse-3|2 Ne. 3:3-24]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 20#^verse-25|3 Ne. 20:25-27]]).

 Jacob loved Joseph very much and gave him a coat of many colors, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 37#^verse-3|Gen. 37:3]].

 Because of jealousy Joseph's brothers grew to hate him and plotted to kill him, but instead sold him to merchants, who were on their way to Egypt, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 37#^verse-5|Gen. 37:5-36]].

 In Egypt, the Lord prospered Joseph and he became ruler of Potiphar's house, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 39#^verse-1|Gen. 39:1-4]].

 Potiphar's wife lied, saying that Joseph attempted to seduce her; Joseph was wrongly condemned and put into prison, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 39#^verse-7|Gen. 39:7-20]].

 Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's chief butler and baker, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 40|Gen. 40]].

 Pharaoh began to favor Joseph because Joseph had interpreted one of Pharaoh's dreams; he made Joseph a ruler over Egypt, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 41#^verse-14|Gen. 41:14-45]].

 Ephraim and Manasseh were born, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 41#^verse-50|Gen. 41:50-52]].

 Joseph was reunited with his father and brothers, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 45|Gen. 45-46]].

 Joseph died in Egypt at the age of 110 years, [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 50#^verse-22|Gen. 50:22-26]].
