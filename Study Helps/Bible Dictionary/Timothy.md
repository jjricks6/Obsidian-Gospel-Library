 Honored of God. The son of a Greek father and Jewish mother (Eunice) living at Lystra ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-1|Acts 16:1-3]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-5|2 Tim. 1:5]]); circumcised by Paul in order that he might be of greater use for evangelistic work among Jews ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-3|Acts 16:3]]); spoken of by Paul as his own "son in the faith" ([[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1#^verse-2|1 Tim. 1:2, 18]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-2|2 Tim. 1:2]]); at Philippi ([[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 2#^verse-22|Philip. 2:22]]); at Beroea ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17#^verse-14|Acts 17:14]]); sent to Thessalonica ([[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 3#^verse-2|1 Thes. 3:2]]); with Paul at Corinth ([[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 1#^verse-1|1 Thes. 1:1]]; [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 1#^verse-1|2 Thes. 1:1]]); sent to Macedonia ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 19#^verse-22|Acts 19:22]]); to Corinth ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 16#^verse-10|1 Cor. 16:10]]); with Paul in Macedonia when he wrote [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 1#^verse-1|2 Cor. 1:1, 19]]; and at Corinth ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 16#^verse-21|Rom. 16:21]]); followed him to Troas ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 20#^verse-4|Acts 20:4-5]]); at Rome ([[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 1#^verse-1|Philip. 1:1]]; [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 2#^verse-19|2:19]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 1#^verse-1|Col. 1:1]]; [[New Testament/Philemon#^verse-1|Philem. 1:1]]); at Ephesus ([[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1#^verse-3|1 Tim. 1:3]]); Paul wished him to come to Rome ([[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-9|2 Tim. 4:9, 21]]); set at liberty (the details of the imprisonment are unknown) ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13#^verse-23|Heb. 13:23]]). Timothy was perhaps Paul's most trusted and capable assistant, as in [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 2#^verse-19|Philip. 2:19-23]].
