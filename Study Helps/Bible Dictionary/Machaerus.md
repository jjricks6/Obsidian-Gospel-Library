 A fortress in Perea above the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea. It is not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but Josephus (Antiquities, 18.5.1-2) mentions it as the place where John the Baptist was imprisoned and beheaded, as in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14#^verse-10|Matt. 14:10-11]] and [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 6#^verse-17|Mark 6:17-28]]. Some ruins still remain at the site.
