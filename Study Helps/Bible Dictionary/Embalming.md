 The preparation of bodies for burial, for which the Egyptians had an elaborate procedure. [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 50#^verse-2|Gen. 50:2]] (concerning Jacob) is the only detailed reference in the Bible to Israelite use of the Egyptian system, although it is probable that Joseph and others were embalmed in this manner ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 50#^verse-26|Gen. 50:26]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 16#^verse-13|2 Chr. 16:13-14]]).
