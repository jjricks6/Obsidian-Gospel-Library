 Name. Son of Noah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5#^verse-29|Gen. 5:29-32]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 6#^verse-10|6:10]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 7#^verse-13|7:13]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 8#^verse-16|8:16]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 9#^verse-26|9:26]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 8#^verse-12|Moses 8:12]]); his descendants ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10#^verse-21|Gen. 10:21-31]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 11#^verse-10|11:10-32]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 1#^verse-17|1 Chr. 1:17]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-36|Luke 3:36]]). Shem was the traditional ancestor of the Shemitic or Semitic races, a group of kindred nations, which includes the Arabs, the Hebrews and Phoenicians, the Arameans or Syrians, the Babylonians and Assyrians. The languages spoken by these various nations were closely related and were known as the Semitic languages. In latter-day revelation Shem is referred to as "the great high priest" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 138#^verse-41|D&C 138:41]]).
