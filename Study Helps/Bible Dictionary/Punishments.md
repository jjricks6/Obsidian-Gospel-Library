 The object of the punishments of the Mosaic law was the extirpation of evil in Israel ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 19#^verse-19|Deut. 19:19-21]]), and they were apportioned on the principle of righteous retribution. It was life for life, wound for wound, beast for beast ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 21#^verse-23|Ex. 21:23-25]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 24#^verse-17|Lev. 24:17-21]]). The ordinary capital punishment was stoning ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 17#^verse-5|Deut. 17:5]]), the witnesses, after laying their hands on the head of the condemned, casting the first stone. Executions took place outside the city ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 24#^verse-14|Lev. 24:14]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 21#^verse-13|1 Kgs. 21:13]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-58|Acts 7:58]]). The dead body was sometimes burned with fire ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 20#^verse-14|Lev. 20:14]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 21#^verse-9|21:9]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 7#^verse-25|Josh. 7:25]]) or hanged on a tree ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 21#^verse-22|Deut. 21:22]]). In the latter case it must be cut down and buried the same day ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 21#^verse-23|Deut. 21:23]]). The inhabitants of a city given to idolatry were to be slain with the edge of the sword ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 13#^verse-15|Deut. 13:15]]). Minor punishments were: beating with a rodâ€”not more than 40 strokes could be administered ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 25#^verse-2|Deut. 25:2-3]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 10#^verse-13|Prov. 10:13]]); suffering the same injury that the wrongdoer had inflicted ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 24#^verse-17|Lev. 24:17-22]]); fines in money or kind as compensation for the injury done ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 22#^verse-4|Ex. 22:4-9]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 22#^verse-19|Deut. 22:19]]); or in default, the delinquent might be sold as a slave ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 22#^verse-3|Ex. 22:3]]). Neither imprisonment nor banishment was a punishment recognized by the law, but offenders were imprisoned under the kings (compare Micaiah, Jeremiah, and the various allusions to prisons), and Ezra was authorized by Artaxerxes to punish lawbreakers by imprisonment and banishment ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 7#^verse-26|Ezra 7:26]]). Torture was not allowed in any case. Punishments were as a rule inflicted on the offender alone, and not on his wife and family ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 24#^verse-16|Deut. 24:16]]).
