 Name of a Philistine god. Used as a title for the "chief of the demons," or Satan. The Pharisees referred to him as the "prince of the devils" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 12#^verse-24|Matt. 12:24]]). Jesus denied that He cast out devils by the power of Beelzebub ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 11#^verse-14|Luke 11:14-20]]). See also [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 1#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 1:1-6]], where it is spelled Baalzebub.
