 The word denotes those who adopt the Greek language and possibly also Greek modes of life. The KJV does not use the word itself but translates it "Grecians" ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 6#^verse-1|Acts 6:1]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-29|9:29]], etc.). The Hellenists were Jews who had settled in Greek-speaking countries, and themselves used that language. It was for their use that the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, was made.
