 An important part of an Israelite's dress, owing to the regulation in [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 15#^verse-38|Num. 15:38-39]]. It was really a tassel at each "wing" or corner of the tallith or mantle ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14#^verse-36|Matt. 14:36]]). The law required that it should be bound with a thread of blue, the color of heaven. The strict Jews to this day wear these tassels, though they are usually concealed. The Pharisees made them conspicuously large ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 23#^verse-5|Matt. 23:5]]). It would be the tassel that hung over the shoulder at the back that the woman with the issue of blood came and touched ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 8#^verse-44|Luke 8:44]]; also [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 28#^verse-33|Ex. 28:33-34]]).
