 A Jewish meetinghouse for religious purposes. The furniture was generally simple, consisting of an ark containing the rolls of the law and other sacred writings, a reading desk, and seats for the worshippers. Its affairs were managed by the local council of elders, who decided who should be admitted and who should be excluded ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 6#^verse-22|Luke 6:22]]; [[New Testament/John/John 9#^verse-22|John 9:22]]; [[New Testament/John/John 12#^verse-42|12:42]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-2|16:2]]). The most important official was the Ruler of the Synagogue ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 5#^verse-22|Mark 5:22]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 13#^verse-14|Luke 13:14]]), who was generally a scribe, had care of the building, and superintended the various services. There was also an attendant who performed clerical duties ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-20|Luke 4:20]]). The Sabbath morning service was the most important in the week and included a fixed lesson ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 15#^verse-37|Num. 15:37-41]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 6#^verse-4|Deut. 6:4-9]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 11#^verse-13|11:13-21]]) and two lessons for the day, one from the law and the other from the prophets. A sermon was generally preached in explanation of one of the lessons ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-17|Luke 4:17]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-15|Acts 13:15]]). The existence of synagogues in every town in which Jews were living, both in Palestine and elsewhere, was a great help to the spread of the gospel, early Christian missionaries being generally able to get a hearing there (see [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-5|Acts 13:5, 14]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 14#^verse-1|14:1]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17#^verse-1|17:1, 10]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-4|18:4]]), and the synagogue worship provided in many respects a model for early Christian worship.
