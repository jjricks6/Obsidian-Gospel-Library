 (1) A sacred city of the Holy Land, 9Â¼ miles north from Bethel and 11Â½ miles south from Shechem, in the tribe of Ephraim ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 18#^verse-1|Josh. 18:1]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18#^verse-31|Judg. 18:31]]). The tabernacle was here during the greater part of the period of the Judges, and the place continued to be the religious center of the nation ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1#^verse-3|1 Sam. 1:3]]) until after the loss of the Ark in the disastrous battle of Ebenezer. See also [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 22#^verse-9|Josh. 22:9, 12]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 21#^verse-12|Judg. 21:12-23]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1#^verse-24|1 Sam. 1:24]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 3#^verse-21|3:21]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 4#^verse-3|4:3-4]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 14#^verse-3|14:3]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 2#^verse-27|1 Kgs. 2:27]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-2|14:2, 4]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 78#^verse-60|Ps. 78:60]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 7#^verse-12|Jer. 7:12-14]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 26#^verse-6|26:6]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 41#^verse-5|41:5]].

 (2) The name as found in [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-10|Gen. 49:10]] has been regarded by many biblical scholars as a prophecy of the coming of Messiah. This interpretation is confirmed by [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 50#^verse-24|JST Gen. 50:24 (Appendix)]] and was fulfilled in Jesus Christ's being literally of the lineage so as to be the heir to the throne of David. Shiloh can be read as a short form for "He to whom it belongs"; for such a phrase referring to the Messiah, see [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 21#^verse-27|Ezek. 21:27]].
