 Made by Moses at God's command to be a sacramental means of healing for the Israelites in the wilderness ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 21#^verse-9|Num. 21:9]]). It seems to have been carefully preserved and became an object of superstitious worship ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-4|2 Kgs. 18:4]]); it was accordingly destroyed by Hezekiah, who called it "Nehushtan." The "lifting up" of the serpent in the wilderness is referred to by the Lord as a type of His own "lifting up" upon the cross ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-14|John 3:14-15]]). Latter-day revelation confirms the episode of the fiery serpents and the healing properties associated with looking upon Moses' brazen serpent ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 17#^verse-41|1 Ne. 17:41]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 25#^verse-20|2 Ne. 25:20]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 33#^verse-19|Alma 33:19-22]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-46|37:46]]).
