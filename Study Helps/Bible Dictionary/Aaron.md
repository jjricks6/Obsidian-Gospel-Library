 Son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 6#^verse-16|Ex. 6:16-20]]); elder brother of Moses ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 7#^verse-7|Ex. 7:7]]). He was appointed by the Lord to assist Moses in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt and to be his spokesman ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 4#^verse-10|Ex. 4:10-16, 27-31]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 5#^verse-1|5:1-12:50]]). He was with Moses until the 40th year of the wanderings. At Sinai he was one of those who accompanied Moses up the mountain and saw the Lord ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 19#^verse-24|Ex. 19:24]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-1|24:1, 9-11]]). When Moses and Joshua were called up into the mount to commune with God, Aaron and Hur were appointed judges during their absence ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-14|Ex. 24:14, 18]]); it was then that Aaron made the golden calf at the people's request ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 32#^verse-1|Ex. 32:1-6, 21, 24, 35]]). On Mount Sinai Moses received directions about the appointment of Aaron and his four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, to a priesthood that is known as the Aaronic Priesthood ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 28#^verse-1|Ex. 28:1-4]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 29|29]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-18|D&C 84:18, 26-27]]). On the completion of the tabernacle Moses consecrated them to their office ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 8#^verse-9|Lev. 8:9-13]]). Aaron died on Mount Hor at the age of 123 ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 20#^verse-22|Num. 20:22-29]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 33#^verse-38|33:38-39]]).
