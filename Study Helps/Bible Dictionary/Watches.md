 The Jews, like the Babylonians and Greeks, divided the night into three watches, "the beginning of the watches," sunset till 10 p.m. ([[Old Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations 2#^verse-19|Lam. 2:19]]); the "middle watch," 10 p.m. till 2 a.m. ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 7#^verse-19|Judg. 7:19]]); and the "morning watch," 2 a.m. till sunrise ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 14#^verse-24|Ex. 14:24]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 11#^verse-11|1 Sam. 11:11]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12#^verse-38|Luke 12:38]]).
