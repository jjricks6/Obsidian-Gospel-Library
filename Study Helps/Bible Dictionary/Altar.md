 Used for sacrifices and offerings and for sacred ordinances of the gospel. Altars are first mentioned in [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 8#^verse-20|Gen. 8:20]]; animal sacrifice was offered on altars ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 12#^verse-7|Gen. 12:7-8]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 13#^verse-4|13:4, 18]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 22#^verse-9|22:9]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 26#^verse-25|26:25]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 33#^verse-20|33:20]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 35#^verse-7|35:7]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 23#^verse-1|Num. 23:1, 29]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 14#^verse-35|1 Sam. 14:35]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-30|1 Kgs. 18:30-32]]). At the four corners were four horns; on these, the loftiest points of the altar, the blood of the sin offerings was put, that the atonement be brought nearer to God. At times these horns were also a place of refuge for fugitives ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 1#^verse-50|1 Kgs. 1:50]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 2#^verse-28|2:28]]). The materials of an altar were either of raised earth ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 20#^verse-24|Ex. 20:24]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 5#^verse-17|2 Kgs. 5:17]]) or unhewn stones ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 20#^verse-25|Ex. 20:25]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 27#^verse-5|Deut. 27:5]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 8#^verse-31|Josh. 8:31]]). The Israelites often enclosed the earth or stones in a wooden case to preserve the proper shape ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 27#^verse-1|Ex. 27:1]]). The wood again might be overlaid with brass or gold ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 39#^verse-39|Ex. 39:39]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 40#^verse-26|40:26]]). In the tabernacle the Altar of Burnt Offering stood in a court outside the tent; its outer frame was acacia wood overlaid with brass ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 27#^verse-1|Ex. 27:1-2]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 39#^verse-39|39:39]]). Around it, halfway up, was a ledge ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 27#^verse-5|Ex. 27:5]]), with rings and staves by which it was carried. In the Holy Place, before the veil and the mercy seat ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 30#^verse-6|Ex. 30:6]]) was the Altar of Incense, similar in construction to the Altar of Burnt Offering, but smaller and overlaid with gold. On it incense was burned morning and evening (no animal sacrifices); and on its horns once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the blood of the sin offering was put ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 30#^verse-10|Ex. 30:10]]). In the Holy of Holies stood the Ark of the Covenant, and over it the mercy seat. These also served as a type of sin offering on the Day of Atonement ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 16#^verse-14|Lev. 16:14-15]]). The furniture of Solomon's Temple was similar to that of the tabernacle. The Altar of Incense was of cedarwood overlaid with gold. In the outer court stood the brazen altar made after the former pattern, but much larger ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 4#^verse-1|2 Chr. 4:1]]). Ahaz replaced it by an altar apparently of a Damascus pattern ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 16#^verse-11|2 Kgs. 16:11-16]]). Under the Law ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12#^verse-5|Deut. 12:5, 11-14]]) the people were forbidden to build an altar except in the place where God should choose to put His Nameâ€”the temple at Jerusalem; but until the days of Hezekiah sacrifices apparently were offered in other places as well. Altars are also mentioned in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-23|Matt. 5:23]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17#^verse-23|Acts 17:23]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13#^verse-10|Heb. 13:10]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 6#^verse-9|Rev. 6:9]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 8#^verse-3|8:3]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 9#^verse-13|9:13]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 11#^verse-1|11:1]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 2#^verse-7|1 Ne. 2:7]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 15#^verse-17|Alma 15:17]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 135#^verse-7|D&C 135:7]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 1#^verse-8|Abr. 1:8-13]].
