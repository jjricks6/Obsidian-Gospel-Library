 The inscription interpreted by Daniel ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 5#^verse-25|Dan. 5:25-28]]). It can be literally translated "numbered, numbered, weighed, and divisions." Possibly the words are names of weights, "a mina, a mina, a shekel, and a half." Daniel's skill showed itself in his giving to these words an interpretation bearing on the circumstances of the time. In the interpretation ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 5#^verse-28|verse 28]]) peres is found instead of upharsin. The u in upharsin is simply "and." Parsin (which is written pharsin when a vowel precedes) is the plural of peres (pronounced so as to rhyme with deface). Mene should be pronounced so as to rhyme with bewray, and tekel with bewail.
