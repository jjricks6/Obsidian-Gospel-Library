 A terrible form of skin disease spoken of in the Bible. Many notables were at some time afflicted with it, including Moses ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 4#^verse-6|Ex. 4:6-7]]), his sister Miriam ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 12#^verse-10|Num. 12:10]]), Naaman ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 5|2 Kgs. 5]]), and King Uzziah ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 26#^verse-19|2 Chr. 26:19-21]]). In these cases leprosy was given as a sign, a warning, or a punishment. There were apparently several types of leprosy, and the word is used in the Bible to designate other sicknesses or diseases. For example, clothing and walls were said to be leprous when they had patches of mildew or some fungous growth, as in [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 13#^verse-47|Lev. 13:47-59]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 14#^verse-33|14:33-37]]. Instances of Jesus curing leprosy are recorded in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 8#^verse-2|Matt. 8:2-4]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-40|Mark 1:40-45]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-12|Luke 5:12-15]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 17#^verse-11|17:11-15]].
