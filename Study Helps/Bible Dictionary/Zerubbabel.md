 Born in Babylon (the name is Assyrian). Grandson of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and son of Pedaiah ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 3#^verse-16|1 Chr. 3:16-19]]); in [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 3#^verse-2|Ezra 3:2]] and elsewhere he is called "son of Shealtiel," probably his nephew or legal heir. Zerubbabel was also known by the Persian name Sheshbazzar ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 1#^verse-8|Ezra 1:8]], etc.). When Cyrus gave permission to the Jews to return to Palestine, Zerubbabel was appointed pekhah or governor, as the representative of the Jewish royal house ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 1#^verse-8|Ezra 1:8]]). He set up an altar in Jerusalem and rebuilt the temple (see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Temple of Zerubbabel|Temple of Zerubbabel]]) ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 3#^verse-2|Ezra 3:2, 8]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 4#^verse-2|4:2-3]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 5#^verse-2|5:2]]); being helped by Haggai ([[Old Testament/Haggai/Haggai 1#^verse-1|Hag. 1:1-14]]; [[Old Testament/Haggai/Haggai 2|2]]) and Zechariah ([[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 4#^verse-6|Zech. 4:6-10]]). In the New Testament he is called "Zorobabel."
