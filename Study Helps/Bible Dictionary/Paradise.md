 A Persian word meaning "a garden." It is not found in the Old Testament. In the New Testament it occurs in [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-43|Luke 23:43]], [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 12#^verse-4|2 Cor. 12:4]], and [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 2#^verse-7|Rev. 2:7]]. See also [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 9#^verse-13|2 Ne. 9:13]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 40#^verse-12|Alma 40:12, 14]]; [[Book of Mormon/4 Nephi#^verse-14|4 Ne. 1:14]]; [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 10#^verse-34|Moro. 10:34]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 77#^verse-2|D&C 77:2, 5]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Articles of Faith#^verse-10|A of F 1:10]]. Paradise is that part of the spirit world in which the righteous spirits who have departed from this life await the resurrection of the body. It is a condition of happiness and peace. However, the scriptures are not always consistent in the use of the word, especially in the Bible. For example, when Jesus purportedly said to the thief on the cross, "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise" ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-43|Luke 23:43]]), the Bible rendering is incorrect. The statement would more accurately read, "Today shalt thou be with me in the world of spirits" since the thief was not ready for paradise (see HC 5:424-25). Possibly [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 12#^verse-4|2 Cor. 12:4]] should also not use "paradise" in the sense of meaning the spirit world, as much as meaning the celestial kingdom. The "paradisiacal glory" of [[Pearl of Great Price/Articles of Faith#^verse-10|A of F 1:10]] refers to the glorified millennial state of the earth rather than the spirit world.
