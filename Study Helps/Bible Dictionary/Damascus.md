 An ancient city of Syria, standing on a rich plain on the edge of the desert, well watered by the river Barada, of which the Abana and Pharpar ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 5#^verse-12|2 Kgs. 5:12]]) are tributaries. It is first mentioned in the Bible as the birthplace of Eliezer, Abraham's steward ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 15#^verse-2|Gen. 15:2]]). It was taken by David ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-6|2 Sam. 8:6]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 18#^verse-5|1 Chr. 18:5-6]]) (for Syria-damascus read "Syria of Damascus") and is frequently mentioned in the subsequent history ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-24|1 Kgs. 11:24]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 15#^verse-18|15:18]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 20#^verse-34|20:34]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 8:7, 9]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 14#^verse-28|14:28]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 16#^verse-9|16:9-16]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 16#^verse-2|2 Chr. 16:2]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 28#^verse-5|28:5, 23]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 7#^verse-8|Isa. 7:8]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 27#^verse-18|Ezek. 27:18]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 47#^verse-16|47:16-18]]). It was conquered by Tiglath-pileser and its inhabitants carried captive about 733 B.C. ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 16#^verse-9|2 Kgs. 16:9]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 8#^verse-4|Isa. 8:4]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 17#^verse-1|17:1-3]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 49#^verse-23|Jer. 49:23-27]]; [[Old Testament/Amos/Amos 1#^verse-3|Amos 1:3-5]]). It was rebuilt and became an important place during the Persian supremacy. Later on it was conquered by the Greeks and afterwards by the Romans. In New Testament times it was connected with the history of Paul ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-1|Acts 9:1-27]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 22#^verse-5|22:5-16]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-12|26:12, 20]]; [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 11#^verse-32|2 Cor. 11:32]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-17|Gal. 1:17]]). It was then part of the dominions of Aretas, an Arabian prince subject to the Roman emperor. It eventually passed, A.D. 634, into the hands of Moslem (Muslim) Arabs, and is still a city of many thousands of inhabitants.
