 The writer is generally thought of as the Lord's brother ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-19|Gal. 1:19]]), the son of Mary, and is mentioned in [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-17|Acts 12:17]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-13|15:13]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2#^verse-9|Gal. 2:9]]. The epistle, which is addressed to the 12 tribes scattered abroad, was probably written from Jerusalem, but the date is not known. It may be one of the earlier epistles of the New Testament. In the epistle are found some clearly stated items about practical religion, including the important advice of [[New Testament/James/James 1#^verse-5|1:5-6]] that if one lacks wisdom, he should ask of God for help. This instructive passage inspired Joseph Smith to inquire of the Lord in 1820 as to the true church, and as a consequence the Father and the Son appeared to him and the dispensation of the fulness of times was launched ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-9|JS—H 1:9-20]]). Among other important teachings of James are those that have to do with faith and works ([[New Testament/James/James 2|James 2]]); the need to control the unruly tongue ([[New Testament/James/James 3|James 3]]); an exhortation to patience ([[New Testament/James/James 5|James 5]]); calling the elders for a blessing when sick ([[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-14|5:14-16]]); and the desirability of being an instrument of conversion in the life of even one other person ([[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-19|5:19-20]]).
