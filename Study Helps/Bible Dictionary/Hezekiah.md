 (1) King of Judah, and a great religious and political reformer ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-1|2 Kgs. 18:1-21:3]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29#^verse-1|2 Chr. 29:1-33:3]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 36|Isa. 36-39]]). He suppressed idolatry and reconstituted the temple services. In his reforms both in church and state he had the assistance of the great prophet Isaiah. The early part of the reign was prosperous. Hezekiah made a successful expedition against the Philistines ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-8|2 Kgs. 18:8]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 28#^verse-18|2 Chr. 28:18]]) and refused to pay the usual tribute to Assyria ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 18:7]]). Soon after came two Assyrian invasions. The first, under Sargon, is referred to in [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 10#^verse-24|Isa. 10:24-32]]. The second, under Sennacherib, is more fully described in [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-13|2 Kgs. 18:13-19:7]]. After a time of great anxiety the city was at length delivered, probably by a pestilence that broke out in the Assyrian camp. A year later Hezekiah died, after a reign of 29 years.

 (2) Three others ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 3#^verse-23|1 Chr. 3:23]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 7#^verse-21|Neh. 7:21]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 10#^verse-17|10:17]]).
