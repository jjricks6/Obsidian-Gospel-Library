 A "fellow-worker" with Paul, visiting him in prison at Rome as the bearer of gifts from the Philippians and taking back with him the epistle to the Philippians. Epaphras is an abbreviated form of Epaphroditus, but the Colossian teacher of that name is probably quite a different person from the Philippian delegate.
