 Thapsacus, on the western bank of the Euphrates, the river being at that point fordable; a boundary of Solomon's dominions ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 4#^verse-24|1 Kgs. 4:24]]); also famous in classic history as the place where Cyrus with his 10,000 troops crossed the river. The place of this name mentioned in [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 15#^verse-16|2 Kgs. 15:16]] is probably within the kingdom of Israel; its site is unknown.
