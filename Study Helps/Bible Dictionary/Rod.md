 There are several meanings of rod in the scriptures. A shepherd's rod was a club approximately three feet long, with a knob on one end. It was used to beat wolves away from the herd. A staff, sometimes called a rod, is longer; it was used for walking, resting, or for guiding the sheep, as in [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 27#^verse-32|Lev. 27:32]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 23#^verse-4|Ps. 23:4]].

 Moses' and Aaron's rods represented authority, as in [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 4#^verse-1|Ex. 4:1-5]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 7#^verse-9|7:9-12, 17]]. A rod was also used for punishing a wayward child, as in [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 13#^verse-24|Prov. 13:24]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 22#^verse-15|22:15]]; or to whip a supposed offender, as in [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 11#^verse-25|2 Cor. 11:25]] and [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-26|Matt. 27:26]]. A measuring rod was about 10 feet, 10 inches (330 centimeters) long and was used to determine distances (see [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 40#^verse-3|Ezek. 40:3]]). [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 11#^verse-1|Isa. 11:1]] speaks of a rod (Hebrew Khoterâ€”a twig or shoot), which has been identified in latter-day revelation as a prophet of the Restoration ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 113|D&C 113]]).
