 Village of Nahum. A town on the northern end of the Sea of Galilee, probably on the site now known as Tell-HÃ»m. At the time of our Lord the district was one of the most prosperous and crowded in all Palestine. Here the Lord lived after the beginning of His ministry, so that Capernaum is called "his own city" (compare [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-1|Matt. 9:1]] with [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 2#^verse-1|Mark 2:1]]). It was the home of Peter and Andrew ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-29|Mark 1:29]]) and of Matthew ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-9|Matt. 9:9]]). Many of our Lord's miracles were worked here ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 8#^verse-5|Matt. 8:5, 14]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-1|9:1]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-21|Mark 1:21, 30]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 2#^verse-1|2:1]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-31|Luke 4:31-35, 38]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-18|5:18]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 7#^verse-1|7:1]]). In the synagogue at Capernaum was spoken the wonderful discourse found in [[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-59|John 6:59]]. Later the Lord upbraided the people of the place for their rejection of Him ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11#^verse-23|Matt. 11:23]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 10#^verse-15|Luke 10:15]]).
