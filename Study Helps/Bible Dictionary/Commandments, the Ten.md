 ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 34#^verse-28|Ex. 34:28]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 10#^verse-4|Deut. 10:4]].) The Hebrew name for these is the "Ten Words," hence the Greek name Decalogue. They are also called the Covenant ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 9#^verse-9|Deut. 9:9]]) or the Testimony ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 25#^verse-21|Ex. 25:21]]). The giving of the Ten Commandments by God to Moses, and through him to Israel, is described in [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 19#^verse-16|Ex. 19:16-20:21]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 32#^verse-15|32:15-19]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 34#^verse-1|34:1]]. They were engraved on two tables of stone, which were placed in the Ark; hence the Ark was called the Ark of the Covenant ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 10#^verse-33|Num. 10:33]]). There has been a difference of opinion as to the way in which the commandments were divided into ten. The Roman Church, following the example of St. Augustine, unites what we know as the first and second and divides the last into two. Our Lord, quoting from [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 6#^verse-4|Deut. 6:4-5]] and [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 19#^verse-18|Lev. 19:18]], has summarized the Ten Commandments in "two great commandments" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 22#^verse-37|Matt. 22:37-39]]). To get their full significance we must read them in the light of our Lord's Sermon on the Mount (see also [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 2#^verse-27|Mark 2:27]] and [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 15#^verse-4|Matt. 15:4-6]] for interpretation of fourth and fifth), where it is shown that they are intended to control our thoughts and desires as well as our acts.

 The Ten Commandments have been reiterated in latter-day revelation, certifying as to their genuineness and importance, as also Moses' experience on Sinai has been thus verified. See [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 12#^verse-32|Mosiah 12:32-37]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 13#^verse-5|13:5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 42#^verse-18|D&C 42:18-28]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 59#^verse-5|59:5-13]].
