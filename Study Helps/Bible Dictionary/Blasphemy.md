 Generally denotes contemptuous speech concerning God or concerning something that stands in a sacred relation toward God, such as His temple, His law, or His prophet. Our Lord was on several different occasions charged by the Jews with speaking blasphemy, because He claimed the right to forgive sins ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-3|Matt. 9:3]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-21|Luke 5:21]]), because He called Himself Son of God ([[New Testament/John/John 10#^verse-22|John 10:22-36]]), and because He said they would see Him "sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-64|Matt. 26:64-65]]). These charges would have been true if He had not actually been all that He said He was. The charge brought against Him by the false witnesses at the trial before the Sanhedrin ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-59|Matt. 26:59-61]]; [[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-7|John 19:7]]) was one of blasphemy against God's temple. Our Lord's Apostles, on the other hand, regarded the behavior of the Jews toward Him and toward themselves as blasphemy ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-39|Matt. 27:39]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-65|Luke 22:65]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-39|23:39]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-45|Acts 13:45]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-6|18:6]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-11|26:11]]). A false accusation of blasphemy was also brought against Naboth ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 21#^verse-9|1 Kgs. 21:9-13]]) and against Stephen ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 6#^verse-11|Acts 6:11]]).

 The punishment for willful and intentional blasphemy was death by stoning ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 24#^verse-11|Lev. 24:11-16]]; [[New Testament/John/John 10#^verse-31|John 10:31-33]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-58|Acts 7:58]]). Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which is willfully denying Christ after having received a perfect knowledge of Him from the Holy Ghost, is the unforgivable sin ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 12#^verse-31|Matt. 12:31-32]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 3#^verse-28|Mark 3:28-29]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-27|D&C 132:27]]).
