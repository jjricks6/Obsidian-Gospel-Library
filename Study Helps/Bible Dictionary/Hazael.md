 King of Syria from about 886 to 840 B.C. Frequently mentioned in the lives of Elijah and Elisha ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 19#^verse-15|1 Kgs. 19:15, 17]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-8|2 Kgs. 8:8-14]]). He became king by murdering his master Benhadad ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-15|2 Kgs. 8:15]]) and soon started on a war with Israel and Judah for the possession of Ramoth-gilead ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-28|8:28-29]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 9#^verse-14|9:14-15]]). We learn from Assyrian inscriptions that he was attacked and defeated in Damascus by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria; but a few years later he was again strong enough to attack Israel ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 10#^verse-32|2 Kgs. 10:32]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 12#^verse-17|12:17-18]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 13#^verse-3|13:3-7, 22]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 24#^verse-24|2 Chr. 24:24]]).
