 (1) Son of Saul and Rizpah ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 21#^verse-8|2 Sam. 21:8]]).

 (2) A lame son of Jonathan ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 4#^verse-4|2 Sam. 4:4]]); with Machir at Lodebar ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 9#^verse-6|9:6]]); David's kindness to him ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 9#^verse-5|9:5-13]]); Ziba's slander ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 16#^verse-1|16:1-4]]); his defense ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 19#^verse-24|19:24-28]]); David spares him ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 21#^verse-7|21:7]]). His true name was Merib-baal; but later Israelites were unwilling to pronounce the name Baal ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 23#^verse-13|Ex. 23:13]]) and substituted for it bosheth ("shameful thing").
