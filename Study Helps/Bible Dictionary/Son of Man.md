 A title of our Lord, found in the Gospels about 80 times, used by Him in speaking of Himself but never used by anyone else in speaking of Him, though we see from [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-56|Acts 7:56]] that Christians did apply it to Him soon after His Ascension. In the Old Testament the expression "son of man" is frequently used to denote simply "a man" ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 23#^verse-19|Num. 23:19]]; [[Old Testament/Job/Job 25#^verse-6|Job 25:6]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 8#^verse-4|Ps. 8:4]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 80#^verse-17|80:17]]). The expression is found 90 times in the book of Ezekiel, where the Lord uses the term for the prophet.

 The main ideas that probably underlie the title as applied to our Lord are (1) lowliness, humility, and suffering ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11#^verse-19|Matt. 11:19]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 8#^verse-31|Mark 8:31]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-31|9:31]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 10#^verse-45|10:45]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 14#^verse-21|14:21]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 7#^verse-34|Luke 7:34]]); (2) honor and dignity, as head and founder of the kingdom of God, and judge of all men ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 13#^verse-41|Matt. 13:41]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16#^verse-28|16:28]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 19#^verse-28|19:28]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 24#^verse-30|24:30-31]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25#^verse-31|25:31]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-64|26:64]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 2#^verse-10|Mark 2:10, 28]]); (3) the thought of Him as the representative or ideal Man, chosen by our Lord as expressive of His headship over the whole human family.

 Latter-day revelation confirms the special meaning and sacredness of this phrase when used as a name of the Savior, as in [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 45#^verse-39|D&C 45:39]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 49#^verse-6|49:6, 22]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 58#^verse-65|58:65]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-57|Moses 6:57]].
