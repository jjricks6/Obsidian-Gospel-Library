 A tribe descended from Lot, the nephew of Abraham ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 19#^verse-38|Gen. 19:38]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 2#^verse-19|Deut. 2:19]]); worshippers of Molech or Milcom ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-7|1 Kgs. 11:7, 33]]); they were settled east of Mount Gilead, from the Jabbok southwards, and in the time of the Judges laid claim to the Israelite settlements in Gilead ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 11|Judg. 11]]) but were repulsed by Jephthah and again by Saul ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 11|1 Sam. 11]]) and finally reduced to subjection by David ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 10|2 Sam. 10]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 11#^verse-1|11:1]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 12#^verse-9|12:9, 26, 31]]). They regained their independence after David's death and maintained it, as allies of their Aramean neighbors and bitter enemies of Israel, till they fell under the power of Assyria and Chaldea ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 24#^verse-2|2 Kgs. 24:2]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 25#^verse-2|Ezek. 25:2-10]]; [[Old Testament/Amos/Amos 1#^verse-13|Amos 1:13-15]]; [[Old Testament/Zephaniah/Zephaniah 2#^verse-8|Zeph. 2:8]]). Nor were they less hostile to the Jews after the Captivity ([[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 4|Neh. 4]]). Even under foreign rule the obstinate little nation retained its individuality for two centuries after Christ till it disappeared, absorbed by the advance of the Arabs. The capital Rabbath Ammon received a Greek colony and the name of Philadelphia from Ptolemy Philadelphus, but the old name reappears in the modern Amman.
