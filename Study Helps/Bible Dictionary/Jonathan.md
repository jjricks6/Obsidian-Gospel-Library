 (1) Son of Gershom, a Levite who hired himself as a house-priest to Micah the Ephraimite ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 17#^verse-7|Judg. 17:7-13]]). Through him idolatrous worship was established in Dan ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18|Judg. 18]]).

 (2) Son of Saul, and friend of David; frequently mentioned in [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 13|1 Sam. 13-23]]. His friendship for David, whom he might naturally have regarded as a rival, is one of the most unselfish incidents in Old Testament history. He was killed, along with Saul, on Mount Gilboa. David's lamentation over them is among the most beautiful of Bible poems ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 1|2 Sam. 1]]). Jonathan's body was rescued from Beth-shan by the men of Jabesh-gilead. He left one son, Merib-baal, afterwards called Mephibosheth.

 (3) David's nephew ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 21#^verse-21|2 Sam. 21:21]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 20#^verse-7|1 Chr. 20:7]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 27#^verse-32|27:32]]).

 (4) Son of Abiathar ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 15#^verse-27|2 Sam. 15:27, 36]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 17#^verse-17|17:17, 20]]).

 (5) Five others ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 23#^verse-32|2 Sam. 23:32]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 11#^verse-34|1 Chr. 11:34]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 27#^verse-25|27:25]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 10#^verse-15|Ezra 10:15]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 37#^verse-15|Jer. 37:15, 20]]).
