 Hebrew minchah. The English word meat in this context is used in the older sense of "food." The Minchah consisted chiefly of grain (or flour and cakes made from grain) and wine, seasoned with salt, and offered with incense. The Minchah could not be offered with a sin offering, but no burnt or peace offering was complete without it. Part was placed on the altar of burnt offering; the remainder was usually eaten by the priests in a holy place ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 6#^verse-14|Lev. 6:14-18, 23]]; [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 1#^verse-11|Mal. 1:11]]). It was such an important part of the daily burnt offering that the term is sometimes used to denote the whole morning or evening sacrifice ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 3#^verse-20|2 Kgs. 3:20]]).
