 A skull. The name by which the KJV ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-33|Luke 23:33]]) denotes the place where our Lord was crucified. Calvary is merely an English form of the Latin word calvaria, which is itself a translation of the Hebrew word [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Golgotha|Golgotha]], "a skull." The popular expression "Mount Calvary" is not warranted by any statement in the Gospels. There is no mention of a mount in any of the narratives of the Crucifixion. See Golgotha.
