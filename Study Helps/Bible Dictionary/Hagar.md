 Flight. An Egyptian handmaid of Sarah and mother of Abraham's son Ishmael ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 16|Gen. 16]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 21#^verse-9|21:9-21]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 25#^verse-12|25:12]]). After the birth of Isaac, the "child of promise," Hagar and her son were expelled. Paul uses the story as an allegory to show the difference between the two covenants, the one a covenant of bondage and the other one of freedom ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-24|Gal. 4:24]]).
