 Grace. Mother of Samuel, who was given to her in answer to prayer ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1#^verse-2|1 Sam. 1:2-2:21]]). Her song of thanksgiving may be compared with that of Mary ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-46|Luke 1:46-55]]). It contains the first reference to the title Messiah ("his Anointed") ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 2#^verse-10|1 Sam. 2:10]]).
