 Also known as the Ark of Jehovah and the Ark of the Testimony; an oblong chest of acacia or shittim wood overlaid with gold, 2Â½ cubits long, 1Â½ broad and high, made by Moses at God's command ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 25|Ex. 25]]). It was the oldest and most sacred of the religious symbols of the Israelites, and the Mercy Seat which formed its covering was regarded as the earthly dwelling place of Jehovah ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 25#^verse-22|Ex. 25:22]]). (See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Mercy Seat|Mercy Seat]].) The Ark was fitted with rings and staves, by which it was carried. Prayers were recited before it moved or rested ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 10#^verse-35|Num. 10:35-36]]), and during its progress it was treated with the greatest reverence. According to [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-9|1 Kgs. 8:9]] it contained only the Tables of the Law, but in [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9#^verse-4|Heb. 9:4]] it is said to have contained the "pot of manna" and "Aaron's rod that budded," which had been ordered to be kept "before the Testimony" ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 16#^verse-32|Ex. 16:32-34]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 25#^verse-16|25:16]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 40#^verse-20|40:20]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 17#^verse-10|Num. 17:10]]). The usual resting place of the Ark was in the Holy of Holies (see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Tabernacle|Tabernacle]]). It led the way at the passage of the Jordan ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 3#^verse-3|Josh. 3:3-13]]); it was present at the capture of Jericho ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 6|Josh. 6]]); and during the conquest of Canaan it seems to have been kept at Gilgal ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 9#^verse-6|9:6]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 10#^verse-43|10:43]]). It was present at the solemn service held at Ebal ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 8#^verse-30|8:30-33]]). Later on it was removed to Shiloh ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 18#^verse-1|18:1]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 3#^verse-3|1 Sam. 3:3]]). In the days of Eli it was captured by the Philistines ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 4|1 Sam. 4-7]]), who sent it back to Beth-shemesh ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 6#^verse-11|6:11-20]]), whence it was taken to Kirjath-jearim or Baale of Judah ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 6#^verse-21|6:21-7:2]]). Thence it was brought by David to Jerusalem, the journey being interrupted at Perezuzzah ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 6|2 Sam. 6]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 13#^verse-11|1 Chr. 13:11]]). In Jerusalem it was placed in a separate tent, which David pitched for it ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 7#^verse-2|2 Sam. 7:2]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 16#^verse-1|1 Chr. 16:1]]). It accompanied the army in the war against Ammon ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 11#^verse-11|2 Sam. 11:11]]), but David refused to take it with him in his campaign against Absalom ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 15#^verse-24|2 Sam. 15:24-25]]). On the completion of Solomon's temple it was placed in the Holy of Holies ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 8:1-8]]). Apparently it was removed by Manasseh and reinstated by Josiah ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 33|2 Chr. 33]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 35#^verse-3|35:3]]). In 2 Maccabees 2:4 there is an untrustworthy tradition of its preservation by Jeremiah at the destruction of the temple. It had certainly disappeared before the building of the second temple. It was seen by John in his vision of heaven ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 11#^verse-19|Rev. 11:19]]).
