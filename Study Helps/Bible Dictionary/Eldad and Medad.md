 Two of the 70 elders who assisted Moses in the wilderness. They are mentioned because they received the gift of prophecy in connection with their call, even though they didn't go as appointed to the tabernacle. When Joshua wished Moses to forbid them to prophesy, Moses said, "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!" ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 11#^verse-24|Num. 11:24-29]]).
