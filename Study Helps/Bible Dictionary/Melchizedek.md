 King of Righteousness. A notable prophet and leader who lived about 2000 B.C. He is called the king of Salem (Jerusalem), king of peace, and "priest of the most High God." Unfortunately, information concerning him in the Bible is relatively scarce, being limited to [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-18|Gen. 14:18-20]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 5#^verse-6|Heb. 5:6]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 7#^verse-1|7:1-3]]. Mention of the priesthood of Melchizedek is given in several other instances, primarily in Psalms and in Hebrews. However, latter-day revelation gives us much more about him and his priesthood (see [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-18|JST Gen. 14:17 [Gen. 14:18 note d]]]; [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 14#^verse-25|JST Gen. 14:25-40]]; [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Hebrews/JST, Hebrews 7#^verse-3|JST Heb. 7:3 [Appendix]]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 13#^verse-14|Alma 13:14-19]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-14|D&C 84:14]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-1|107:1-4]]). From these sources we realize something of the greatness of this prophet and the grandeur of his ministry.
