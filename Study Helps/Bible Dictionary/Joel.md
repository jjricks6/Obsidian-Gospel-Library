 A prophet of Judah. The date of his prophecy is uncertain; it may have been spoken as early as the reign of Joash, before 850 B.C., or even so late as after the Return. The occasion of the prophecy was a severe visitation of drought and locusts. He assures the people that on repentance they will again receive the blessings of God. His prophecy of the outpouring of the Spirit ([[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 2#^verse-28|2:28-32]]) was quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 2#^verse-17|Acts 2:17]]), and by the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith ([[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-41|JS—H 1:41]]). There are also traces of Joel in Revelation.
