 Camel's hair is clipped from the animal's neck, back, and hump and woven into a coarse, durable, rough, and often itchy clothlike material and used for clothing. The camel's hair garment worn by John the Baptist ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-6|Mark 1:6]]) was possibly used as part of his austerity to separate him from the soft raiment and gorgeous apparel of the kings' courts ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11#^verse-8|Matt. 11:8]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 7#^verse-25|Luke 7:25]]) and from the Pharisees and Sadducees.
