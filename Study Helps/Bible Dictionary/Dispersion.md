 A title applied to all Israelites who remained settled in foreign countries subsequent to the decree of Cyrus ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 1|Ezra 1]]). The Epistle of James is addressed to them ([[New Testament/James/James 1#^verse-1|James 1:1]]; see also [[New Testament/John/John 7#^verse-35|John 7:35]]). One result of this dispersion was the existence in many different parts of the world of Jewish synagogues, which became of great service to the spread of Christianity ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 2#^verse-5|Acts 2:5-11]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 6#^verse-9|6:9]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-43|13:43-45]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 14#^verse-1|14:1-2, 19]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-3|16:3]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17#^verse-1|17:1, 10-13]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-2|18:2, 12, 19]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 19#^verse-13|19:13-17, 33]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 28#^verse-17|28:17-29]]). All Jews, wherever they might be, regarded the temple at Jerusalem as the center of their worship and contributed the usual half-shekel toward its maintenance ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-24|Matt. 17:24]]). The Jews of Babylonia spoke an Aramaic dialect similar to that spoken in Palestine. The Jews of Syria, Egypt, and Italy adopted the Greek language and along with it many Greek ideas. For their use, the Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint was made.
