 One of the attributes of God ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 46#^verse-9|Isa. 46:9-10]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-18|Acts 15:18]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 9#^verse-20|2 Ne. 9:20]]). Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for one's salvation; hence the gospel is to be taught to every soul. "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10#^verse-14|Rom. 10:14]]). Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 28#^verse-9|Isa. 28:9-10]]). The scriptures, and also living prophets, are given so that the people might have knowledge of things of God and "know how to worship, and know what you worship" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-19|D&C 93:19]]). Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost ([[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-26|John 14:26]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-13|16:13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 34#^verse-10|D&C 34:10]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 121#^verse-26|121:26-33]]) and one of the gifts of the Spirit ([[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 12#^verse-8|1 Cor. 12:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 10#^verse-10|Moro. 10:10]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 46#^verse-18|D&C 46:18]]). Peter lists knowledge along with faith, patience, kindness, and virtue as necessary acquisitions for one who would seek for a divine nature ([[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 1#^verse-3|2 Pet. 1:3-9]]). Since no one can be saved in ignorance of the gospel ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 131#^verse-6|D&C 131:6]]), and one progresses only as fast as he gains knowledge (HC 4:588), it follows that the person who gains knowledge will have "the advantage in the world to come" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 130#^verse-18|D&C 130:18-19]]).

 Other references showing the importance of gaining knowledge are [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 1#^verse-20|Prov. 1:20-33]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 3#^verse-13|3:13-26]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 4#^verse-1|4:1-13]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 8|8]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 15#^verse-14|15:14]]; [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 24#^verse-3|24:3-4]]; [[New Testament/John/John 17#^verse-3|John 17:3]]; [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 3#^verse-8|Philip. 3:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 32#^verse-7|2 Ne. 32:7]].
