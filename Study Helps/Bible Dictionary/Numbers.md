 The book that bears this name is so called from the double numbering or census of the people ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1|Num. 1-4]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 26|26]]). It contains notices of events in the wilderness, more especially in the second year after the Exodus, and at the close of the wandering, interspersed with legislation. (1) [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1#^verse-1|1:1-10:10]], preparation for departure from Sinai. (2) [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 10#^verse-11|10:11-14:45]], march from Sinai to borders of Canaan; the sending of the spies and their report; the refusal to enter Canaan, and God's punishment for disobedience. (3) [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 15#^verse-1|15:1-19:22]], various laws and historical notices. (4) [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 20#^verse-1|20:1-36:13]], the history of the last year in the wilderness from the second arrival of the Israelites in Kadesh till they reach "the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho." The book is remarkable for the number of fragments of ancient poetry preserved in it ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 6#^verse-24|6:24-26]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 10#^verse-35|10:35-36]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 21#^verse-14|21:14-15, 17-18, 27-30]]).
