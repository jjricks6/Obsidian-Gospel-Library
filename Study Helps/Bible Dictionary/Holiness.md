 According to the Old Testament, things or places were holy that were set apart for a sacred purpose; the opposite of holy is therefore common or profane ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 21#^verse-5|1 Sam. 21:5]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 22#^verse-26|Ezek. 22:26]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 42#^verse-20|42:20]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 44#^verse-23|44:23]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 48#^verse-13|48:13-15]]). Similarly a holy person meant one who held a sacred office. The Israelites were a holy people because they stood in a special relationship to Jehovah. Under the guidance of the Prophets it was seen that what distinguished Jehovah from the gods of the heathen was His personal character. The word holy therefore came to refer to moral character ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 11#^verse-44|Lev. 11:44]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 19#^verse-2|19:2]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 21#^verse-8|21:8]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 6#^verse-3|Isa. 6:3-8]]). Israel must be holy in character because the God of Israel was holy ([[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 7#^verse-4|Jer. 7:4-7]]; see also [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-48|Matt. 5:48]]). The Law of Holiness ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 17|Lev. 17-26]]) shows how the attempt was made by means of ceremonial observances to secure this holiness of character. The attempt failed because the later Jews observed the letter and neglected the spirit; they attached more importance to the ceremonial than to the moral; and the result was a lapse into formalism. But in the writings of the Prophets it is clearly laid down that the value of worship in the eyes of God depends upon the personal character of the worshipper.
