 Leprosy is a terrible form of skin disease, still occuring in various parts of the world. Lepers were forbidden by the law to enter any walled city. If a stranger approached, the leper was obliged to cry "unclean." The disease was regarded as a living death, indicated by bare head, rent clothes, and covered lip. For the regulations concerning the treatment of lepers, see [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 13|Lev. 13]] and [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 14|14]].
