 (1) High priest and judge, a descendant of Aaron through Ithamar, his younger son. He was probably the first high priest of this line, and the office remained in his family till the deprivation of Abiathar ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 2#^verse-26|1 Kgs. 2:26-27]]), when it passed back to the family of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son. He is chiefly known to us through his connection with the early history of Samuel ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1|1 Sam. 1-4]]). The blot on his character was his toleration of the wickedness of his own sons.

 (2) My God. ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-46|Matt. 27:46]].) [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 15#^verse-34|Mark 15:34]] renders the word Eloi, which is perhaps a Galilean form.
