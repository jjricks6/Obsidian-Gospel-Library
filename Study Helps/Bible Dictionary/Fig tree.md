 Everywhere common in Palestine, both wild and cultivated. Figs were an important food. The tree is one of the earliest to show its fruitbuds, which appear before the leaves; thus a fig tree with leaves would be expected to also have fruit. Jesus' cursing the fig tree for its fruitlessness ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 11#^verse-12|Mark 11:12-13, 20-23]]) was an allusion to the fruitlessness of Israel. The time when the leaves appear indicates that summer is "nigh at hand" ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 24#^verse-32|Matt. 24:32-33]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 45#^verse-37|D&C 45:37-38]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—Matthew#^verse-38|JS—M 1:38-39]]). For other references to figs, see [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3#^verse-7|Gen. 3:7]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 4#^verse-25|1 Kgs. 4:25]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 20#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 20:7]]; [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-47|John 1:47-50]]. The sycomore, spoken of in [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 9#^verse-10|Isa. 9:10]], [[Old Testament/Amos/Amos 7#^verse-14|Amos 7:14]], and [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 19#^verse-4|Luke 19:4]], was a variety of fig tree.
