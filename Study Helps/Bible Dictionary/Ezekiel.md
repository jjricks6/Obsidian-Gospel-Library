 God will strengthen. A priest of the family of Zadok, and one of the captives carried away by Nebuchadnezzar along with Jehoiachin. He settled at Tel Abib on the Chebar and prophesied during a period of 22 years, 592-570 B.C. The book of Ezekiel has four main divisions: (1) [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 1|1-24]], prophecies of judgment against Jerusalem and the nation; (2) [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 25|25-32]], prophecies against Israel's enemies; (3) [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 33|33-39]], prophecies of restoration; (4) [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 40|40-48]], visions of the reconstruction of the temple and its worship. [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 1|Ezek. 1-39]] is similar in manner and contents to other prophetic writings; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 40|Ezek. 40-48]] is unique in prophecy.

 Among the notable teachings of Ezekiel are [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 3|Ezek. 3]] and [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 18|18]], which show the significance of a prophet's warning and the individual responsibility of every person for the consequences of his own behavior; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 37|Ezek. 37]], which depicts the valley of dry bones, each bone coming together, bone to his bone, in the Resurrection, the restoration of Israel, and the uniting of the stick (record) or Ephraim with the stick of Judah; and [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 47|Ezek. 47-48]], the description of the latter-day temple in Jerusalem, the river running from the temple into the Dead Sea to heal it, and the building of a city "foursquare." Ezekiel was a man of many visions and spoke much about the future restoration of Israel and the glory of the millennial reign of the Lord. The authenticity of his writings is specifically confirmed by latter-day revelation, as in [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 29#^verse-21|D&C 29:21]].
