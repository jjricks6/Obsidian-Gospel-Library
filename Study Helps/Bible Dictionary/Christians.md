 A name first given to believers in Jesus Christ at Antioch in Syria, about A.D. 43 ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 11#^verse-26|Acts 11:26]]). It was perhaps given contemptuously but was accepted by followers of Christ as a fit title. See [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4#^verse-16|1 Pet. 4:16]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 46#^verse-15|Alma 46:15]].
