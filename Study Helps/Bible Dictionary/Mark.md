 Also called John; son of Mary, who had a house of considerable size in Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-12|Acts 12:12]]); cousin (or nephew) of Barnabas ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-10|Col. 4:10]]); accompanied Paul and Barnabas from Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-25|Acts 12:25]]) and on their first missionary journey, deserting them at Perga ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-5|13:5, 13]]); accompanied Barnabas to Cyprus ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-37|15:37-39]]); with Paul at Rome ([[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-10|Col. 4:10]]; [[New Testament/Philemon#^verse-24|Philem. 1:24]]); with Peter at Babylon (probably Rome) ([[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 5#^verse-13|1 Pet. 5:13]]); with Timothy at Ephesus ([[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-11|2 Tim. 4:11]]). His gospel (see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Gospels|Gospels]]) was possibly written under the direction of Peter. His object is to describe our Lord as the incarnate Son of God, living and acting among men. The Gospel contains a living picture of a living Man. Energy and humility are the characteristics of his portrait. It is full of descriptive touches that help us to realize the impression made upon the bystanders. Tradition states that after Peter's death, Mark visited Egypt, founded the Church of Alexandria, and died by martyrdom.
