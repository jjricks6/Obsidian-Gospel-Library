 The scriptures are rich in symbolism and figurative expression. Ceremonies and ordinances are symbolic in their performance, and all bear record of Jesus Christ ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-63|Moses 6:63]]). Such symbolism is seen in sacrifice ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9#^verse-11|Heb. 9:11-15]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 5#^verse-7|Moses 5:7-8]]); in the sacrament ([[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Mark/JST, Mark 14#^verse-20|JST Mark 14:20-24 [Appendix]]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-13|Luke 22:13-20]]); and in baptism ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 6#^verse-1|Rom. 6:1-6]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-12|D&C 128:12-13]]). Biblical names especially are symbolic (see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Christ, names of|Christ, names of]] and [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Names of persons|Names of persons]]). The tabernacle ceremony was symbolic of eternal things ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 8|Heb. 8-10]]), as was the entire law of Moses, containing types and shadows of Christ ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 13#^verse-29|Mosiah 13:29-32]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 25#^verse-15|Alma 25:15]]). For other symbolic items see [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 20#^verse-8|Ex. 20:8-11]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-13|Matt. 5:13-16]]; [[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 4#^verse-5|Jacob 4:5]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-38|Alma 37:38-45]].
