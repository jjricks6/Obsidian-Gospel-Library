 Sometimes denotes an agreement between persons ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 23#^verse-18|1 Sam. 23:18]]) or nations ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 11#^verse-1|1 Sam. 11:1]]); more often between God and man; but in this latter case it is important to notice that the two parties to the agreement do not stand in the relation of independent and equal contractors. God in His good pleasure fixes the terms, which man accepts. The same word is sometimes rendered "testament."

 The gospel is so arranged that principles and ordinances are received by covenant, placing the recipient under strong obligation and responsibility to honor the commitment. Thus the severe consequences to Ananias and Sapphira, who deliberately broke their covenant and lied unto God ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 5#^verse-1|Acts 5:1-11]]).
