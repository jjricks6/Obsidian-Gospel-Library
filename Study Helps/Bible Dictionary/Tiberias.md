 A large town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, built by Herod Antipas, who made it his capital and called it after the name of the reigning emperor, Tiberius ([[New Testament/John/John 6#^verse-23|John 6:23]]). The place is not mentioned in the first three Gospels. Apparently it was never visited by the Lord. After the destruction of Jerusalem it became an important center of Jewish rabbinical learning.
