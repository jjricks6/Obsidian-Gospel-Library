 A district forming the northern part of the Roman province of Asia. Paul, Silas, and Timothy were forbidden by the Spirit to preach in Asia ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-7|Acts 16:7-8]]); they turned toward Bithynia, which district also was forbidden to them; they then passed through Mysia, without preaching, and came to the coast at Troas.
