 Capital of Assyria on the eastern bank of the Tigris, its traditional founder being Nimrod, the great hunter ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10#^verse-11|Gen. 10:11-12]]). For several centuries Calah outstripped it in importance, but under Sennacherib it again became the capital ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 19#^verse-36|2 Kgs. 19:36]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 37#^verse-37|Isa. 37:37]]). It was for more than 200 years a great commercial center and also contained a large library of clay books. The city fell at the downfall of the Assyrian empire, 606 B.C.
