 Regarded by the Israelites as the seat of the life or vital energy of all flesh ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 17#^verse-10|Lev. 17:10-14]]). In Old Testament times blood was forbidden as food ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 9#^verse-4|Gen. 9:4]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 3#^verse-17|Lev. 3:17]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 7#^verse-26|7:26-27]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 19#^verse-26|19:26]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12#^verse-16|Deut. 12:16, 23]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 15#^verse-23|15:23]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 14#^verse-32|1 Sam. 14:32-34]]), which restriction was continued in the Church in New Testament times, at the Jerusalem conference ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-20|Acts 15:20-29]]). The atoning power of a sacrifice was in the blood because it was regarded as containing the life of the animal and because the sacrifice was a type of the great sacrifice who is Jesus Christ ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 17#^verse-11|Lev. 17:11]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9#^verse-22|Heb. 9:22]]). The scripture says that "almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission" ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9#^verse-22|Heb. 9:22]]). Jesus worked out a perfect atonement by the shedding of His own blood ([[New Testament/1 John/1 John 1#^verse-7|1 Jn. 1:7]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 5#^verse-9|Rev. 5:9-10]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 3#^verse-16|Mosiah 3:16-19]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 27#^verse-19|3 Ne. 27:19-21]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 45#^verse-4|D&C 45:4]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-69|76:69]]). Joseph Smith, as have many other prophets, sealed his testimony with his blood that the righteous might be honored and the wicked might be condemned ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 6#^verse-9|Rev. 6:9-10]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 135#^verse-6|D&C 135:6-7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 136#^verse-39|136:39]]).

 Often a covenant was sealed with blood ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 15#^verse-9|Gen. 15:9-18]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-8|Ex. 24:8]]; [[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 9#^verse-11|Zech. 9:11]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-28|Matt. 26:28]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 10#^verse-29|Heb. 10:29]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13#^verse-20|13:20]]).
