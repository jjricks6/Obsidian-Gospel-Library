 (Good) fortune. (1) Son of Jacob by Zilpah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 30#^verse-11|Gen. 30:11]]). For the blessing pronounced on the tribe of Gad, see [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-19|Gen. 49:19]] and [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-20|Deut. 33:20-21]], where the warlike character of the Gadites is emphasized. The children of Gad along with the Reubenites were owners of cattle, and for that reason grazing land was allotted to them in Canaan ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 32#^verse-1|Num. 32:1-5]]). Their district lay east of the Jordan and contained good arable pasture land, with an abundance of water. It was given them on condition they went armed before their brethren ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 32|Num. 32]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 34#^verse-14|34:14]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 3#^verse-12|Deut. 3:12-20]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 29#^verse-8|29:8]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 1#^verse-12|Josh. 1:12-18]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 4#^verse-12|4:12]]). Their boundaries are described ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 12#^verse-1|Josh. 12:1-6]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 13#^verse-8|13:8-12]]). After the wars they were sent home with a blessing and built an altar, which caused offense ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 22|Josh. 22]]). The Gadites, who were brave and warlike ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-11|1 Chr. 5:11-22]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 12#^verse-8|12:8, 14]]), were sometimes known as Gileadites ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 5#^verse-17|Judg. 5:17]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 12#^verse-4|12:4]]). Their land was invaded, and they were carried captive by Tiglath-pileser ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 10#^verse-33|2 Kgs. 10:33]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-26|1 Chr. 5:26]]).

 (2) The seer. A prophet and faithful friend and adviser of David ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 22#^verse-5|1 Sam. 22:5]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 24#^verse-11|2 Sam. 24:11-19]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 21#^verse-9|1 Chr. 21:9-19]]). He wrote a book of the acts of David ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 29#^verse-29|1 Chr. 29:29]]) and assisted in the arrangement of the music of the house of God ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29#^verse-25|2 Chr. 29:25]]).
