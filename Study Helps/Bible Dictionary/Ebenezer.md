 Stone of help. A stone set up by Samuel as a token of gratitude for deliverance from the Philistines ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 7#^verse-10|1 Sam. 7:10-12]]). The place had previously been the scene of two defeats ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 4#^verse-1|1 Sam. 4:1]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 5#^verse-1|5:1]]); and in the account of these defeats it is called by the name it received later on. Its position may have been at the head of the valley of Ajalon.
