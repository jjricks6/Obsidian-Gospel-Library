 Ancient capital of Attica, but by New Testament times it was in the Roman province known as Achaia. Much of its former greatness had passed away, and many Athenians had become engrossed in unprofitable discussions that Paul said were "too religious" (superstitious). Philosophy was represented by the Stoics and Epicureans. On his second mission journey Paul visited the city ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 17#^verse-15|Acts 17:15-18:1]]) and made a notable speech on Mars Hill, but it appears that his efforts met with only partial success.
