 The life and work of the great Apostle Paul is recorded at considerable length in the Acts and the epistles. It is only possible to indicate here a few of the chief facts. He was known in early life as Saul; his Latin name Paul is first mentioned at the beginning of his gentile ministry ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-9|Acts 13:9]]). He belonged to Tarsus, in Cilicia ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-11|Acts 9:11]]); was a Pharisee and a pupil of Gamaliel ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 22#^verse-3|Acts 22:3]]); was active in the persecution of Christians ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8#^verse-3|Acts 8:3]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-10|26:10]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-13|Gal. 1:13]]; [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 3#^verse-6|Philip. 3:6]]); and took part in the martyrdom of Stephen ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-58|Acts 7:58]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8#^verse-1|8:1]]). He started for Damascus for the purpose of further persecution ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-1|Acts 9:1]]) and on the road saw a vision of the Lord Jesus, which changed the whole current of his life ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-4|Acts 9:4-19]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 22#^verse-7|22:7]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 26#^verse-14|26:14]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-15|Gal. 1:15-16]]). After his baptism by Ananias ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-18|Acts 9:18]]), he retired into Arabia ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-17|Gal. 1:17]]) and then returned to Damascus, where he preached ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-19|Acts 9:19-25]]; [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 11#^verse-32|2 Cor. 11:32]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-17|Gal. 1:17-18]]). Being compelled to flee, about three years after his conversion he went to Jerusalem, where he stayed 15 days, Barnabas introducing him to Peter and James ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-26|Acts 9:26-30]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-18|Gal. 1:18-19]]). Being in danger, he retired to Tarsus ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-29|Acts 9:29-30]]) and there remained six or seven years, preaching in Syria and Cilicia ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-21|Gal. 1:21-24]]). He was then brought by Barnabas to Antioch ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 11#^verse-26|Acts 11:26]]) and after one year paid a visit to Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 11#^verse-29|Acts 11:29-30]]). After two more years' work in Antioch, he started with Barnabas and Mark on his first missionary journey ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-1|Acts 13:1-14:26]]). Then came another visit to Jerusalem with Barnabas to attend a conference with the other Apostles ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-1|Acts 15:1-33]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2#^verse-1|Gal. 2:1-10]]), after which they returned to Antioch ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-35|Acts 15:35]]). He then started on his second missionary journey ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-36|Acts 15:36-18:22]]), which lasted about three years and ended with a visit to Jerusalem. After a short stay in Antioch, Paul began his third journey, which occupied about 3Â½ years ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-23|Acts 18:23-21:15]]). On his return to Jerusalem he was arrested and sent to Caesarea ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-17|Acts 21:17-23:35]]), where he remained a prisoner for two years ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 24#^verse-1|Acts 24:1-26:32]]), and was then sent for trial to Rome, suffering shipwreck on the way ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 27#^verse-1|Acts 27:1-28:10]]). He remained in Rome two years ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 28#^verse-30|Acts 28:30]]) and was then released. He then appears to have visited Asia, Macedonia, Crete, and perhaps Spain. At the end of about four years he was again taken a prisoner to Rome and suffered martyrdom, probably in the spring of A.D. 65.
