 The Lord (is) righteousness. The last king of Judah, his name changed from Mattaniah to Zedekiah ([[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 23#^verse-6|Jer. 23:6]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 33#^verse-16|33:16]]).

 Book of Mormon references to Zedekiah are many, a notable contribution being the information that not all of the sons of Zedekiah were slain (as implied in [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 52#^verse-10|Jer. 52:10]]), for one son, Mulek, came to the Western Hemisphere ([[Book of Mormon/Helaman/Helaman 8#^verse-21|Hel. 8:21]]). See also [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 1#^verse-4|1 Ne. 1:4]]; [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5#^verse-12|5:12-13]]; [[Book of Mormon/Omni#^verse-15|Omni 1:15]]; [[Book of Mormon/Helaman/Helaman 6#^verse-10|Hel. 6:10]].
