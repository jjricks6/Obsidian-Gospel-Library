 Field of blood. The popular name for the field bought with the money returned to the chief priests by Judas ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-3|Matt. 27:3-10]]). From [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1#^verse-18|Acts 1:18-19]] it appears to have been so called as being the scene of his death. It was afterwards used as a buryingplace for "strangers" (Jews of the dispersion and proselytes).
