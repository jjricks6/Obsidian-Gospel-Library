 The unlawful association of men and women. Although generally having reference to illicit activity of married persons, the scripture often does not distinguish between the married and the unmarried. While adultery is usually spoken of in the individual sense, it is sometimes used to illustrate the apostasy of a nation or a whole people from the ways of the Lord, such as Israel forsaking her God and going after strange gods and strange practices ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 20#^verse-14|Ex. 20:14]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 3#^verse-7|Jer. 3:7-10]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-27|Matt. 5:27-32]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 18#^verse-11|Luke 18:11]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 43#^verse-24|D&C 43:24-25]]). Severe penalties were given in the Old Testament for adultery ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 20#^verse-10|Lev. 20:10]]); and unrepentant adulterers will suffer the judgments of God in the world to come ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13#^verse-4|Heb. 13:4]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 18#^verse-3|Rev. 18:3-18]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-103|D&C 76:103]]).
