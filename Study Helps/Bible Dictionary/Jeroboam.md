 (1) Son of Nebat ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-26|1 Kgs. 11:26-14:20]]); the first king of divided kingdom of Israel; a member of the tribe of Ephraim, which led the revolt against the house of Judah and family of David. This revolt seems to have had the approval of the prophet Ahijah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-29|11:29-40]]), but one of Jeroboam's first steps after the separation was to set up image worship in Dan and Bethel, the two calves being supposed to be images of Jehovah. This sin made his name proverbial ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 15#^verse-34|15:34]]) and called down on him the rebuke of the prophet Ahijah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-6|14:6-16]]). He also made priests of men who were not of the family of Aaron ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12#^verse-31|1 Kgs. 12:31]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 13#^verse-9|2 Chr. 13:9]]); he instituted a new feast of his own, and also began the worship of wooden images or Asherah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-15|1 Kgs. 14:15]]).

 (2) Jeroboam â¡, of the dynasty of Jehu, the ablest of the kings of Israel, and the most successful in war ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 13#^verse-13|2 Kgs. 13:13]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 14#^verse-16|14:16, 23, 27-29]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 15#^verse-1|15:1, 8]]). Amos and Hosea prophesied during his reign, and denounced the idolatry, licentiousness, and oppression that prevailed throughout the kingdom.
