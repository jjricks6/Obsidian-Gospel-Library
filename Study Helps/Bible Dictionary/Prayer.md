 Before the first generation of mankind had passed away, men began to call upon the name of the Lord ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 4#^verse-26|Gen. 4:26]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 5#^verse-4|Moses 5:4]]). Prayers, whether with ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 12#^verse-8|Gen. 12:8]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 13#^verse-4|13:4]]) or without ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 20#^verse-7|Gen. 20:7]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 32#^verse-9|32:9-11]]) sacrifice, were constantly offered by the patriarchs to God. The efficacy of the intercession of good men was recognized ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 18#^verse-23|Gen. 18:23]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 20#^verse-7|20:7]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 32#^verse-11|Ex. 32:11]]).

 Prayer is nowhere specifically commanded as a duty in the law, and prayers were not prescribed at the sacrifices except on two occasions: a confession of sin on the Day of Atonement ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 16#^verse-21|Lev. 16:21]]) and a thanksgiving when offering the firstfruits and tithes ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 26#^verse-3|Deut. 26:3, 13]]). It is, however, certain from the nature of things, and from the custom in later times, that prayer accompanied sacrifice.

 Even in the times of the Judges, the children of Israel did not forget to cry unto the Lord, and a model of prayer is furnished by Hannah ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 2#^verse-1|1 Sam. 2:1]]). Samuel was recognized by his nation to be characteristically a man of prayer ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 7#^verse-5|1 Sam. 7:5, 8]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 12#^verse-19|12:19, 23]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 99#^verse-6|Ps. 99:6]]). David's Psalms, and the Psalms generally, breathe the highest spirit of prayer. The nation that possessed them must have been rich in teachers and examples of prayer. Remarkable prayers were prayed by Solomon ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8|1 Kgs. 8]]); Hezekiah ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 19#^verse-14|2 Kgs. 19:14]], etc.; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 38#^verse-9|Isa. 38:9]], etc.); Ezra ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 9#^verse-5|Ezra 9:5]]); the Levites ([[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 9#^verse-5|Neh. 9:5]], etc.); and Daniel ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 9#^verse-3|Dan. 9:3]], etc.). "Making many prayers" was a part of the corrupt religion of Israel under the later kings ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 1#^verse-15|Isa. 1:15]]) and a marked feature of the religion of the Pharisees ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-5|Matt. 6:5]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 23#^verse-14|23:14]]).

 It was the custom to pray three times a day, as did David ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 55#^verse-17|Ps. 55:17]]), Daniel ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6#^verse-10|Dan. 6:10]]), and the later Jews. Prayer was said before meat ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 9#^verse-13|1 Sam. 9:13]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 15#^verse-36|Matt. 15:36]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 27#^verse-35|Acts 27:35]]).

 The attitude of prayer ordinarily was standing ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1#^verse-26|1 Sam. 1:26]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 9#^verse-2|Neh. 9:2, 4]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-5|Matt. 6:5]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 18#^verse-11|Luke 18:11, 13]]); also kneeling ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-54|1 Kgs. 8:54]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 9#^verse-5|Ezra 9:5]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6#^verse-10|Dan. 6:10]]); or prostrate ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 7#^verse-6|Josh. 7:6]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 8#^verse-6|Neh. 8:6]]). The hands were spread forth to heaven ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-22|1 Kgs. 8:22]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 9#^verse-5|Ezra 9:5]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 141#^verse-2|Ps. 141:2]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 1#^verse-15|Isa. 1:15]]). Smiting on the breast and rending of the garments signified special sorrow ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 9#^verse-5|Ezra 9:5]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 18#^verse-13|Luke 18:13]]). The Lord's attitude in prayer is recorded only once. In the Garden of Gethsemane He knelt ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-41|Luke 22:41]]), fell on His face ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-39|Matt. 26:39]]), and fell on the ground ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 14#^verse-35|Mark 14:35]]). It is noteworthy that Stephen ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-60|Acts 7:60]]), Peter ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-40|9:40]]), Paul ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 20#^verse-36|20:36]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-5|21:5]]), and the Christians generally ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-5|21:5]]) knelt to pray.

 Prayers were said at the Sanctuary ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1#^verse-9|1 Sam. 1:9-12]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8|1 Kgs. 8]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 42#^verse-2|Ps. 42:2, 4]]) or looking toward the Sanctuary ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-44|1 Kgs. 8:44, 48]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 5#^verse-7|Ps. 5:7]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6#^verse-10|Dan. 6:10]]); on the housetop or in an upper chamber ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6#^verse-10|Dan. 6:10]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10#^verse-9|Acts 10:9]]). The Pharisees prayed publicly in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-5|Matt. 6:5]]). The Lord prayed upon the tops of mountains ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14#^verse-23|Matt. 14:23]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 9#^verse-28|Luke 9:28]]) or in solitary places ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-35|Mark 1:35]]).

 As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are His children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 7#^verse-7|Matt. 7:7-11]]). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.

 There are many passages in the New Testament that teach the duty of prayer ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 7#^verse-7|Matt. 7:7]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-41|26:41]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 18#^verse-1|Luke 18:1]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 21#^verse-36|21:36]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 6#^verse-18|Eph. 6:18]]; [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 4#^verse-6|Philip. 4:6]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-2|Col. 4:2]]; [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 5#^verse-17|1 Thes. 5:17, 25]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 2#^verse-1|1 Tim. 2:1, 8]]). Christians are taught to pray in Christ's name ([[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-13|John 14:13-14]]; [[New Testament/John/John 15#^verse-7|15:7, 16]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-23|16:23-24]]). We pray in Christ's name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christâ€”when His words abide in us ([[New Testament/John/John 15#^verse-7|John 15:7]]). We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ's name at all; they in no way represent His mind but spring out of the selfishness of man's heart.

 Book of Mormon references on prayer include [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 18#^verse-3|1 Ne. 18:3]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 34#^verse-17|Alma 34:17-28]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 2#^verse-14|Ether 2:14]].
