 Originally known as Aram (or "the highlands"), a general name for the country north and northeast of Palestine. The people were of Semitic origin ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10#^verse-22|Gen. 10:22]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 22#^verse-21|22:21]]) and were descended from the same stock as the Israelites. (See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Aram, Arameans|Aram]].) At the beginning of the Hebrew monarchy Syria was divided into a number of small kingdoms, such as Damascus ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-5|2 Sam. 8:5-6]]), Maachah and Geshur ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 15#^verse-8|2 Sam. 15:8]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 19#^verse-6|1 Chr. 19:6]]), Beth-Rehob ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 10#^verse-6|2 Sam. 10:6]]), and Zobah ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 10#^verse-6|2 Sam. 10:6, 8]]). These kingdoms were as a rule rivals of Israel ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-3|2 Sam. 8:3-6]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-23|1 Kgs. 11:23-25]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 15#^verse-18|15:18]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 20#^verse-34|20:34]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 22|22]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 6#^verse-24|2 Kgs. 6:24-7:20]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-28|8:28-29]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 10#^verse-32|10:32-33]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 21#^verse-17|21:17-18]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 13#^verse-3|13:3-7, 25]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 14#^verse-28|14:28]]). As the Assyrian kingdom grew stronger, Syria grew weaker, and Damascus was destroyed ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 16#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 16:7-9]]). Under Seleucus Nicator (312 B.C.) Syria again became a powerful kingdom with Antioch as its capital. Antiochus the Great (223 B.C.) increased its strength, and Palestine became a Syrian province. Then followed the Maccabean rebellion (see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Maccabees|Maccabees]]). In 66 B.C. Syria was conquered by Pompey and became a Roman province; as such it is mentioned in the New Testament in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4#^verse-24|Matt. 4:24]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-2|Luke 2:2]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15#^verse-41|Acts 15:41]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-18|18:18]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-3|21:3]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 1#^verse-21|Gal. 1:21]].
