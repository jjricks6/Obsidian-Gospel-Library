 The Law ordered that a yearling lamb, with its proper meal and drink offerings, should be offered every morning and every evening as a burnt offering ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 29#^verse-38|Ex. 29:38-42]]). This was never omitted, at least in later times, except in the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes and for about three weeks before the taking of Jerusalem by Titus. In the Holy Place, every morning and evening, incense was burnt upon the altar of incense ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 30#^verse-7|Ex. 30:7-8]]). There was also a meal offering twice every day, probably in connection with the daily burnt offering ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 6#^verse-20|Lev. 6:20]]). The offering of the daily sacrifices was accompanied with (1) music, vocal and instrumental ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29#^verse-27|2 Chr. 29:27-28]]); (2) worship and prayer on the part of the people present ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29#^verse-28|2 Chr. 29:28]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-10|Luke 1:10]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3#^verse-1|Acts 3:1]]); (3) psalms, one being appointed for each day in the week: [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 24|Ps. 24]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 48|48]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 81|81]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 82|82]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 92|92]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 93|93]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 94|94]]. Besides the public offerings, numerous private offerings were daily made. In later times daily offerings were also made on behalf of the gentile authorities, the kings of Persia ([[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 6#^verse-9|Ezra 6:9-10]]), the kings of Syria, and the Roman emperors and Roman people.
