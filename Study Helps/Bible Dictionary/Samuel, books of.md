 In the Hebrew Bible these books form one. Our division into two books follows the Greek Bible. The books begin with the birth of Samuel (hence the title) and carry us down nearly to the death of David, a period of about 130 years. It is uncertain who the author was or when he wrote. In order to compile his narrative he no doubt used various writings that he found already in existence, including the state chronicles (among which were writings by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 10#^verse-25|1 Sam. 10:25]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 29#^verse-29|1 Chr. 29:29]]). In some cases he has combined together two different accounts of the same event and has not always been careful to reconcile the two together (compare the two accounts of David's introduction to Saul, [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 16#^verse-14|1 Sam. 16:14-23]] and [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 17#^verse-1|17:1-18:5]]). He also made use of various national and religious poems, which may have been preserved in writing or by oral tradition, such as Hannah's song ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 2#^verse-1|1 Sam. 2:1-10]]); David's lament for Abner ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 3#^verse-33|2 Sam. 3:33-34]]); David's thanksgiving and his last words ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 22|2 Sam. 22]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 23#^verse-1|23:1-7]]); see also the reference to the Book of Jasher ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 1#^verse-18|2 Sam. 1:18]]).
