 The word saint is a translation of a Greek word also rendered "holy," the fundamental idea being that of consecration or separation for a sacred purpose; but since what was set apart for God must be without blemish, the word came to mean "free from blemish," whether physical or moral. In the New Testament the saints are all those who by baptism have entered into the Christian covenant (see [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-13|Acts 9:13, 32, 41]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 1#^verse-7|Rom. 1:7]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 1#^verse-2|1 Cor. 1:2]]; [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 1#^verse-1|Philip. 1:1]]; [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 1#^verse-14|1 Pet. 1:14-15]]).
