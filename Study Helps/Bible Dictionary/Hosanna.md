 Save now. The word is taken from [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 118#^verse-25|Ps. 118:25]], one of the Psalms of the Hallel. The chanting of this psalm was connected at the Feast of Tabernacles with the waving of palm branches; hence the use of the word by the multitudes at our Lord's triumphal entry into Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 21#^verse-9|Matt. 21:9, 15]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 11#^verse-9|Mark 11:9-10]]; [[New Testament/John/John 12#^verse-13|John 12:13]]).
