 The name given to bands of prophets or "sons of prophets" living together for instruction and worship under Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha. Little is known about these schools, but they seem to have been important religious institutions in Israel and references to them are frequent ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 10#^verse-11|1 Sam. 10:11]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 19#^verse-19|19:19-20]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 2#^verse-3|2 Kgs. 2:3, 5]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 4#^verse-38|4:38]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 6#^verse-1|6:1]]). Not all the "sons of the prophets" claimed to have a supernatural gift; they were simply trained religious teachers, while some inspired prophets had received no training in the schools ([[Old Testament/Amos/Amos 7#^verse-14|Amos 7:14]]; see also [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-127|D&C 88:127, 136-38]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 90#^verse-7|90:7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 95#^verse-10|95:10, 17]]).
