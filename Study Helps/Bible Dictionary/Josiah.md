 (1) King of Judah, 641-610 B.C. (see [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 22|2 Kgs. 22-24]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 34|2 Chr. 34-35]]). While still young, he made, under the guidance of Hilkiah, a thorough religious reformation, which extended to the northern tribes. He restored the temple, destroyed idolatrous images and the high places, put down the idolatrous priests, and celebrated a great Passover ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23#^verse-21|2 Kgs. 23:21-23]]). During this reformation a book of the law was found by Hilkiah ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 22#^verse-8|2 Kgs. 22:8-9]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 34#^verse-15|2 Chr. 34:15-16]]). It made at once a great impression and led to the centralizing of all sacrificial worship at Jerusalem and the abolition of local idolatrous sanctuaries or high places. Josiah became involved in the war between Assyria and Egypt, and, though Pharaoh Necho disclaimed enmity, Josiah met him in battle at Megiddo and was defeated and slain ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 35#^verse-20|2 Chr. 35:20-25]]; see also [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23#^verse-29|2 Kgs. 23:29-30]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 22#^verse-10|Jer. 22:10-12, 18]]; [[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 12#^verse-11|Zech. 12:11]]).

 (2) Son of Zephaniah ([[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 6#^verse-10|Zech. 6:10]]).
