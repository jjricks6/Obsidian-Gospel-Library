 Dispersion. This refers to the scattering of the house of Israel into lands other than Palestine. In many instances those scattered remained in those lands and did not return. The Jews in particular penetrated all the large cities of the Roman Empire and established centers of Judaism, with synagogues, although they retained strong ties with Jerusalem, making frequent pilgrimages there at the Feasts of Passover, Pentecost, Tabernacles, etc. ([[New Testament/John/John 7#^verse-35|John 7:35]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 2#^verse-5|Acts 2:5, 9-11]]). In these countries the Jews often adopted many traits of Greek and Roman culture. Paul was a Jew of the diaspora, as was also Aquila.
