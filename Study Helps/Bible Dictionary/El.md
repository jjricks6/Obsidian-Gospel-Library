 Might, strength. In Hebrew and related languages it designates "the divine being." Many biblical names employ El with other words, such as Bethel ("the house of God"), Eleazar ("God has helped"), Michael ("who is like God"), Daniel ("a judge is God"), Ezekiel ("God will strengthen"), and Israel ("to prevail with God" or perhaps "let God prevail"). Possibly the best known use of El is in Elohim, a plural form signifying the "almighty" or "omnipotent," a name applied to the Father.
