 One of the Twelve; son of Zebedee and brother of James. In his early life he was a fisherman in fairly comfortable circumstances ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-20|Mark 1:20]]). We may assume he is the unnamed disciple of the Baptist mentioned in [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-40|John 1:40]]. Later on he received a call to be a disciple of Jesus Christ ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4#^verse-21|Matt. 4:21-22]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 5#^verse-1|Luke 5:1-11]]). He was one of the inner circle of three who were with the Lord at the raising of Jairus's daughter, at the Transfiguration, and in Gethsemane. In his own Gospel he refers to himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" ([[New Testament/John/John 13#^verse-23|John 13:23]]; [[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-26|19:26]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-2|20:2]]; [[New Testament/John/John 21#^verse-7|21:7, 20]]) and that "other disciple" ([[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-2|John 20:2-8]]). From Jesus he received the name Boanerges, "a son of thunder" ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 3#^verse-17|Mark 3:17]]). Other incidents that reveal his character are recorded in [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-38|Mark 9:38]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 10#^verse-35|10:35-40]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 9#^verse-54|Luke 9:54]]. There are frequent references to him in the accounts of the Crucifixion and Resurrection ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-8|Luke 22:8]]; [[New Testament/John/John 18#^verse-15|John 18:15]]; [[New Testament/John/John 19#^verse-26|19:26-27]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-2|20:2]]; [[New Testament/John/John 21#^verse-2|21:2]]). In the Acts he appears but seldom ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3#^verse-1|Acts 3:1, 11]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 4#^verse-13|4:13]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8#^verse-14|8:14]]). Paul refers to his meeting with him in Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2#^verse-9|Gal. 2:9]]). In [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 1#^verse-9|Rev. 1:9]] John tells of his banishment to Patmos.

 John is mentioned frequently in latter-day revelation, as in [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 14#^verse-18|1 Ne. 14:18-27]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 28#^verse-6|3 Ne. 28:6]]; [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 4#^verse-16|Ether 4:16]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 7|D&C 7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 27#^verse-12|27:12]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 61#^verse-14|61:14]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 77|77]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-141|88:141]]. These passages serve to confirm and to clarify the biblical record of John and also give us a hint as to his greatness and the importance of the work the Lord has given him to do on the earth, not only in the time of the New Testament, but also in the last days. We especially have a clarification of [[New Testament/John/John 21#^verse-20|John 21:20-23]], ascertaining that John did not die but has been allowed to remain on the earth as a ministering servant until the time of the Lord's Second Coming ([[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 28#^verse-6|3 Ne. 28:6]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 7|D&C 7]]).
