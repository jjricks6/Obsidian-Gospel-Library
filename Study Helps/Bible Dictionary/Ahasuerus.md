 Old Testament name of one Median and two Persian kings. (1) [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 9#^verse-1|Dan. 9:1]], father of "Darius the Mede."

 (2) [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 4#^verse-6|Ezra 4:6]]; probably the same as (3).

 (3) [[Old Testament/Esther/Esther 1#^verse-1|Esth. 1:1]], where Ahasuerus is certainly to be identified with Xerxes.
