 Pillars of Solomon's temple ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 7#^verse-21|1 Kgs. 7:21]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 3#^verse-17|2 Chr. 3:17]]); the names denote "He will establish" and "In Him is strength." The pillars, which stood on the south and north sides of the porch, were probably ornamental and not intended to support any part of the weight of the building.
