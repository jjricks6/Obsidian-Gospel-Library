 Porcius Festus, successor of Felix as procurator of Judea ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 24#^verse-27|Acts 24:27]]). Finding Paul in prison at Caesarea, he proposed to try him in Jerusalem. To avoid such a trial, Paul appealed to Caesar. While waiting for an opportunity to send him to Rome, Festus was visited by Herod Agrippa. Paul was brought before them and made a speech in his own defense. Festus died two years after his appointment to Judea.
