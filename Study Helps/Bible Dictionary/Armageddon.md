 A Greek transliteration from the Hebrew Har Megiddon, or "Mountain of Megiddo." The valley of Megiddo is in the western portion of the plain of Esdraelon about 75 miles north of Jerusalem. Several times the valley of Megiddo was the scene of violent and crucial battles during Old Testament times ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 5#^verse-19|Judg. 5:19]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 9#^verse-27|2 Kgs. 9:27]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23#^verse-29|23:29]]). A great and final conflict taking place at the Second Coming of the Lord is called the battle of Armageddon. See [[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 11|Zech. 11-14]], especially [[Old Testament/Zechariah/Zechariah 12#^verse-11|12:11]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 16#^verse-14|Rev. 16:14-21]].
