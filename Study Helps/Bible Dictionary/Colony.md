 A name given to a city, usually on the frontier of the Empire, in which for military reasons a body of Roman citizens had been placed in full enjoyment of all rights of citizenship ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-12|Acts 16:12-13]]). Apparently few Jewish people were in the colony, for it appears there was no synagogue there, and the people met for prayer at the river.
