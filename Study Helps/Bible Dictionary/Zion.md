 The word Zion is used repeatedly in all the standard works of the Church and is defined in latter-day revelation as "the pure in heart" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 97#^verse-21|D&C 97:21]]). Other usages of Zion have to do with a geographical location. For example, Enoch built a city that was called Zion ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 7#^verse-18|Moses 7:18-19]]); Solomon built his temple on Mount Zion ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 8:1]]; see also [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 5#^verse-6|2 Sam. 5:6-7]]); and Jackson County, Missouri, is called Zion in many of the revelations in the D&C, such as [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 58#^verse-49|58:49-50]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 62#^verse-4|62:4]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 63#^verse-48|63:48]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 72#^verse-13|72:13]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-76|84:76]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 104#^verse-47|104:47]]. The city of New Jerusalem, to be built in Jackson County, Missouri, is to be called Zion ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 45#^verse-66|D&C 45:66-67]]). The revelations also speak of "the cause of Zion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 6#^verse-6|D&C 6:6]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 11#^verse-6|11:6]]). In a wider sense all of North and South America are Zion (HC 6:318-19).

(In the New Testament, Zion is spelled Sion.)
