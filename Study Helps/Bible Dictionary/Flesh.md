 Permission to eat flesh is found in [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 9#^verse-3|Gen. 9:3]] and [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 49#^verse-18|D&C 49:18-19]] (see also [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 4#^verse-1|1 Tim. 4:1-3]]). [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 9#^verse-11|JST Gen. 9:11 (Appendix)]] adds a caution against wasting flesh or needlessly killing animals. There is a prohibition against eating flesh of animals dying a natural death ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 17#^verse-15|Lev. 17:15]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 14#^verse-21|Deut. 14:21]]), partly because they would not have been properly bled. The flesh is often spoken of as being a part of our mortal or fallen nature (as in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-41|Matt. 26:41]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 7#^verse-5|Rom. 7:5, 14-23]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-3|8:3]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 3#^verse-1|1 Cor. 3:1-2]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 2#^verse-3|Eph. 2:3]]); as opposed to the Spirit ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-5|Rom. 8:5-9]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3#^verse-3|Gal. 3:3]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 5#^verse-17|5:17-25]]), and as needing to be overcome ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4#^verse-4|Matt. 4:4]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-7|Rom. 8:7, 12-13]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 5#^verse-17|Gal. 5:17, 24]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 6#^verse-8|6:8]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 2#^verse-11|Col. 2:11]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 3#^verse-5|3:5]]; [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4#^verse-2|1 Pet. 4:2]]; [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 2#^verse-16|1 Jn. 2:16-17]]). Since flesh often means "mortality," Adam is spoken of as the "first flesh" upon the earth, meaning he was the first mortal on the earth, all things being created in a nonmortal condition and becoming mortal through the Fall of Adam. Jesus is the "Only Begotten of the Father" in the flesh, meaning He is the only one begotten of the Father into mortality ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 3#^verse-7|Moses 3:7]]).
