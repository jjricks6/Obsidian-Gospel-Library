 This has always been regarded by Eastern nations as a duty of the highest importance. [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 18#^verse-1|Gen. 18:1-5]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 19#^verse-1|19:1-3]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 2#^verse-20|Ex. 2:20]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 13#^verse-15|Judg. 13:15]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 19#^verse-20|19:20-21]] tell of instances of the readiness with which hospitality was offered to strangers. Such hospitality was a necessity of desert life. A host was bound at all cost to protect the life and property of his guest, even though previously unknown to him. To taste another man's salt was to establish a claim on his protection. The New Testament enjoins the duty even more emphatically ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 10#^verse-42|Matt. 10:42]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25#^verse-43|25:43]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 12#^verse-13|Rom. 12:13]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 3#^verse-2|1 Tim. 3:2]]; [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 1#^verse-8|Titus 1:8]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13#^verse-2|Heb. 13:2]]; [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4#^verse-9|1 Pet. 4:9]]).
