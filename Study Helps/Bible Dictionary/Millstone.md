 A mill consisted of two heavy flat circular stones, one resting on the other. The lower remained fixed. The upper one was rotated, by means of a handle, around a peg fastened into the lower stone and passed through a funnel-shaped hole in the upper one. Grain was poured into this funnel and ground between the two stones, and flour came out at the circumference. Small mills were worked by hand; larger ones were turned by an ass ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 18#^verse-6|Matt. 18:6]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 9#^verse-42|Mark 9:42]]).
