 Strength. Slain for touching the Ark ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 6#^verse-6|2 Sam. 6:6]]); called Uzza ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 13#^verse-9|1 Chr. 13:9]]). The penalty may appear to us severe, but it must be remembered that the Ark was a sacred repository, and the people had been clearly warned that only designated persons could touch the Ark, and warned also of the consequences of disobedience.
