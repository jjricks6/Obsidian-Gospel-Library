 Capital of the Roman province of Asia and a great commercial center. Ephesus was three miles from the sea, on the banks of the navigable river Cayster. It was an important business center, much of the commerce between east and west passing along the great highway that connected Ephesus with the Euphrates. It thus became a natural center for the Christian Church in Asia Minor. The city was celebrated as the guardian of the image of Artemis or Diana ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 19#^verse-35|Acts 19:35]]), and there was a large manufacture of silver shrines of the goddess. The magnificence of her temple was proverbial. Ephesus was visited by Paul at the close of his second missionary journey ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-19|Acts 18:19]]); he stayed there for two years on his third journey ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 19|Acts 19]]) and left in consequence of a disturbance caused by silversmiths whose trade in shrines of the goddess had suffered in consequence of the growth of the Christian faith. See also [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 20#^verse-17|Acts 20:17]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-32|1 Cor. 15:32]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 16#^verse-8|16:8]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1#^verse-3|1 Tim. 1:3]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-18|2 Tim. 1:18]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-12|4:12]]. The city was also closely connected with the life of [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/John|John]]. See also John.
