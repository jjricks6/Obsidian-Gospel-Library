 Snakes marked with flamelike spots, or whose bite caused acute inflammation ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 21#^verse-6|Num. 21:6]]). The Lord sent these upon the children of Israel to "straiten them," and He prepared a way that those who were bitten might be healed by looking at the serpent of brass that Moses raised up before them, which was a symbol of the Redeemer being lifted upon the cross ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-14|John 3:14-15]]). The event is confirmed in latter-day revelation ([[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 17#^verse-41|1 Ne. 17:41]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 25#^verse-20|2 Ne. 25:20]]).
