 The Philistine giant killed by David ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 17|1 Sam. 17]]). In [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 21#^verse-19|2 Sam. 21:19]] the reference is probably to a different man of the same name, or some error may have crept into the text. See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Giants|Giants]].
