 The Hebrews appear to have been ignorant of coinage until the Persian period. Before that time gold and silver were used as a medium of exchange, but payments were made by weight. Hence the temptation arose to use false weights and false balances. Before the Exile sums of money were usually reckoned in shekels or talents. By a shekel we must always understand a shekel of silver, unless it is expressly stated to be of gold. In the Maccabean period the weight of a shekel was 218 grains (15.126 grams); in earlier times it may have been lighter.

 The only coin, properly so called, mentioned in the Old Testament is the gold dram, bearing the figure of a crowned king who is kneeling and is holding in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow.

 Simon Maccabaeus coined silver shekels and half-shekels, as well as bronze money. The shekel had on one side the figure of a cup, with the inscription "Shekel of Israel," and on the other a branch with three buds and the words "Jerusalem the Holy."

 The following coins are mentioned in the New Testament:

 The drachme ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 15#^verse-8|Luke 15:8-9]]), the ordinary silver Greek coin, and the didrachmon (or double drachme) ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-24|Matt. 17:24]]), translated "half-shekel" in some Bibles, or "tribute money" in KJV.

 The stater ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-27|Matt. 17:27]]), originally of gold, but in New Testament times of silver, and equal to four drachmes. In [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-27|Matt. 17:27]], the KJV tanslates the word as "a piece of money." The pieces of silver mentioned in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-15|Matt. 26:15]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-3|27:3, 5-6]] were probably staters.

 The lepton (or mite) ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 12#^verse-42|Mark 12:42]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12#^verse-59|Luke 12:59]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 21#^verse-2|21:2]]), the smallest bronze coin used by the Jews. Equaled one-half quadrans.

 The Roman silver denarius. The KJV always translates this word as "penny."

 The assarion ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 10#^verse-29|Matt. 10:29]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12#^verse-6|Luke 12:6]]), or farthing; a bronze coin originally one-tenth, but in New Testament times one-sixteenth, of a denarius.

 The kodrantes (Latin quadrans) ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5#^verse-26|Matt. 5:26]], where it is translated "farthing," and [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 12#^verse-42|Mark 12:42]], where it is translated "mites"); equaled one-fourth assarion.

 The talent ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 18#^verse-24|Matt. 18:24]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25#^verse-15|25:15]]) and the mina (pounds) ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 19#^verse-13|Luke 19:13]]) are not coins but sums of money.
