 Part of the dress of the high priest ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 28#^verse-6|Ex. 28:6]], etc.), shaped like a waistcoat with two shoulder pieces and a girdle. It was of richly variegated material, blue, purple, and scarlet. On the shoulder pieces were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the 12 tribes. To the ephod was fastened the Breastplate of Judgment. An ephod of linen seems to have become the dress of all priests ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 22#^verse-18|1 Sam. 22:18]]). It was also worn by Samuel ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 2#^verse-18|1 Sam. 2:18]]) and by David when he brought up the Ark ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 6#^verse-14|2 Sam. 6:14]]). The ephod at one time became the object of idolatrous worship ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 8#^verse-27|Judg. 8:27]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 17#^verse-5|17:5]]). The name may possibly in these last passages have been used to denote an image of some kind. See also [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Gideon|Gideon]].
