 Red. Name of Esau ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 25#^verse-30|Gen. 25:30]]); of his descendants ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 36|Gen. 36]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 1#^verse-35|1 Chr. 1:35-42]]); of their country in Mount Seir ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 32#^verse-3|Gen. 32:3]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 36#^verse-9|36:9]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 2#^verse-5|Deut. 2:5, 12, 22]]). This country lay south of the Dead Sea, having Moab on the north and the Dead Sea on the northwest. It was not included within the limits of the land of Israel ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 2#^verse-5|Deut. 2:5]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 24#^verse-4|Josh. 24:4]]). From the time of the Maccabees it was known as Idumea. The original inhabitants were "the children of Seir," or Horites ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-6|Gen. 14:6]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 36#^verse-20|36:20]]), and were probably dwellers in holes or caverns. It passed by conquest into the possession of the descendants of Esau; and in [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 2#^verse-4|Deut. 2:4-5]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 23#^verse-7|23:7]], mention is made of the blood relationship between the Israelites and the Edomites. In spite of the kinship there seems to have been great mutual hatred, and wars were of constant occurrence ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 20#^verse-14|Num. 20:14-21]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 21#^verse-4|21:4]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 11#^verse-17|Judg. 11:17]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 14#^verse-47|1 Sam. 14:47]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-13|2 Sam. 8:13-14]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 27#^verse-3|Jer. 27:3]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 49#^verse-7|49:7-22]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 35#^verse-3|Ezek. 35:3-15]]). The Edomites spoke a language that closely resembled Hebrew.
