 (1) A river of Eden ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 2#^verse-13|Gen. 2:13]]).

 (2) A place containing a spring near Jerusalem, where Solomon was anointed king ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 1#^verse-33|1 Kgs. 1:33, 38, 45]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 32#^verse-30|2 Chr. 32:30]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 33#^verse-14|33:14]]). The valley in which Gihon was situated was probably the bed of the Kedron, or valley of Jehoshaphat. The waters of the spring flowed through Hezekiah's tunnel to the pool of Siloam, within the city ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 20#^verse-20|2 Kgs. 20:20]]).
