 Servant of the Lord. (1) The steward of Ahab who protected the prophets of God from Jezebel ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18|1 Kgs. 18]]).

 (2) A prophet who foretold the doom of [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Edom|Edom]]. Nothing is known of his personal history. The prophecy was spoken directly after some capture of Jerusalem (possibly by the Philistines and Arabians during the reign of Jehoram, 848-844 B.C., or more probably by the Chaldeans, 586 B.C.) during which the Edomites had displayed hostility to Judah. (See Edom.) Obadiah foretells their punishment. For the fulfillment of his prophecy see [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 14#^verse-7|2 Kgs. 14:7]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 25#^verse-11|2 Chr. 25:11-12]]. One of the better known passages of Obadiah is [[Old Testament/Obadiah#^verse-21|1:21]], speaking of "saviours ... on mount Zion," which refers to the doctrine of salvation for the dead.
