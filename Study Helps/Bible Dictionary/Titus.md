 Apparently converted by Paul, perhaps at Antioch ([[New Testament/Titus/Titus 1#^verse-4|Titus 1:4]]). Attended the conference at Jerusalem about circumcision ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2#^verse-1|Gal. 2:1]]); probably with Paul on his third missionary journey; sent by him to Corinth as the bearer of 1 Cor. ([[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 7#^verse-6|2 Cor. 7:6-7, 13, 15]]). He then returned to Paul in Macedonia and was again sent to Corinth with 2 Cor. and with instructions about a collection for the poor of Jerusalem ([[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 8#^verse-4|2 Cor. 8:4-7]]). After this we have no mention of him for eight years. At the conclusion of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome, Titus joined him at Ephesus, and they went together to Crete, where Titus remained and where he received a letter from Paul with instructions about his work and asking him to come to Nicopolis ([[New Testament/Titus/Titus 1#^verse-5|Titus 1:5]]; [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 3#^verse-12|3:12]]). Later on he was sent on a mission to Dalmatia ([[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 4#^verse-10|2 Tim. 4:10]]).
