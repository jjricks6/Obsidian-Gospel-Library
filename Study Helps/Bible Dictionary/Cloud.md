 A word often used in the Bible. A pillar of cloud hovered over the camp by day, while Israel traveled through the wilderness. It went before them when they were to march to the next stopping place. At night it became a pillar of fire over the tabernacle ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 13#^verse-21|Ex. 13:21-22]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 14#^verse-24|14:24]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 33#^verse-9|33:9-10]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 9#^verse-15|Num. 9:15-23]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 10#^verse-11|10:11-12, 34]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 31#^verse-15|Deut. 31:15]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 9#^verse-12|Neh. 9:12]]). The Lord called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud on Mount Sinai ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-16|Ex. 24:16]]), and a cloud filled the temple of Solomon ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-10|1 Kgs. 8:10-11]]). The Father spoke from a "bright cloud" on the Mount of Transfiguration ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17#^verse-5|Matt. 17:5]]); and at Jesus' Ascension a cloud received Him out of sight ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1#^verse-9|Acts 1:9]]). These were no doubt clouds of glory, not the dull, gray clouds of rain. Furthermore, at the Lord's second advent He will come with clouds ([[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 1#^verse-7|Rev. 1:7]]).
