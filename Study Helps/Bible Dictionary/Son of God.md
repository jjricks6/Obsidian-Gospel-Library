 It does not appear from the Gospels that our Lord frequently applied this title to Himself (but see [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27#^verse-43|Matt. 27:43]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-70|Luke 22:70]]; [[New Testament/John/John 5#^verse-25|John 5:25]]; [[New Testament/John/John 9#^verse-35|9:35-37]]; [[New Testament/John/John 10#^verse-36|10:36]]; [[New Testament/John/John 11#^verse-4|11:4]]), though we often find it used by others in speaking to Him ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14#^verse-33|Matt. 14:33]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16#^verse-16|16:16]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-41|Luke 4:41]]; [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-49|John 1:49]]; [[New Testament/John/John 11#^verse-27|11:27]]); and of Him ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 1#^verse-1|Mark 1:1]]; [[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-18|John 3:18]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-31|20:31]]). But there is ample proof that He claimed to be the Son of God in a sense that was true of Him and of no one else (see [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11#^verse-27|Matt. 11:27]] [[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 10#^verse-22|Luke 10:22]]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 13#^verse-32|Mark 13:32]]). He speaks of Himself as Son of God, and of others as sons of God, but there is not a single passage in which the sonship of others is spoken of as being the same thing as His own. So too He speaks of "my Father" and "your Father," but never of "our Father." (The Lord's Prayer is no exception, as it was intended for the disciples' use.) There is a consistency in scripture, ancient and modern, that Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God the Father, being the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. See [[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 4#^verse-5|Jacob 4:5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-21|D&C 20:21]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-52|Moses 6:52, 54, 57]].
