 Jesus is spoken of as the Christ and the Messiah, which means He is the one anointed of the Father to be His personal representative in all things pertaining to the salvation of mankind. The English word Christ is from a Greek word meaning "anointed" and is the equivalent of Messiah, which is from a Hebrew and Aramaic term meaning "anointed."
