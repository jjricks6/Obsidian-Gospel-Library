 (1) Son of Terah and brother of Abraham. The father of Lot and also the father of Abraham's wife Sarah ([[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-2|Abr. 2:2]]), he died as the result of a severe famine in Ur of the Chaldees ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 11#^verse-26|Gen. 11:26-31]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-1|Abr. 2:1]]).

 (2) A Levite ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 23#^verse-9|1 Chr. 23:9]]).

 (3) The place of Abraham's (Abram's) first settlement on leaving Ur of the Chaldees; apparently named in memory of Abraham's deceased brother Haran. It was a place of many flocks, and Terah, Abraham's father, tarried there. The Lord appeared to Abraham at Haran ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 11#^verse-29|Gen. 11:29-32]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-4|Abr. 2:4-6]]). It was in the district near the source of the Euphrates and was a trading center of great importance, frequently mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions. It continued to be a flourishing city for many centuries. [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7#^verse-2|Acts 7:2]] renders the word "Charran."
