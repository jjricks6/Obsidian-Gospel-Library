 The preparation of incense is described in [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 30#^verse-34|Ex. 30:34-36]]; the duty of offering it twice daily fell upon the high priest ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 30#^verse-7|Ex. 30:7-8]]), but in the second temple the privilege was extended to all the priests, and the lot was cast each day to decide who should offer it ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-9|Luke 1:9]]). Live coals were brought from the brazen altar of burnt offering and placed on the golden altar of incense; then the priest to whom the lot had fallen entered alone into the Holy Place, carrying in a censer the incense, which he cast on the fire. Then, bowing reverently toward the Holy of Holies, he returned to the congregation, who were praying outside, and pronounced the blessing in [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 6#^verse-24|Num. 6:24-26]]. The choir of Levites at once started to sing the daily psalms. On the Day of Atonement there was a special offering of incense. See [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 141#^verse-2|Ps. 141:2]]; [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 1#^verse-11|Mal. 1:11]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 5#^verse-8|Rev. 5:8]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 8#^verse-3|8:3-4]].
