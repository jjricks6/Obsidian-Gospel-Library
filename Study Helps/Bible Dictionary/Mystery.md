 Denotes in the New Testament a spiritual truth that was once hidden but now is revealed and that without special revelation would have remained unknown. It is generally used along with words denoting revelation or publication ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 16#^verse-25|Rom. 16:25-26]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 1#^verse-9|Eph. 1:9]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 3#^verse-3|3:3-10]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 1#^verse-26|Col. 1:26]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4#^verse-3|4:3]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 3#^verse-16|1 Tim. 3:16]]). The modern meaning of something incomprehensible forms no part of the significance of the word as it occurs in the New Testament. See also [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 12#^verse-9|Alma 12:9-11]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 40#^verse-3|40:3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 19#^verse-10|D&C 19:10]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 42#^verse-61|42:61-65]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 76#^verse-5|76:5-10]]. On the other hand, there is no spiritual gain in idle speculation about things the Lord has not revealed. See [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 29#^verse-29|Deut. 29:29]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37#^verse-11|Alma 37:11]].
