 Usury sometimes has more than one meaning. In biblical English it often means simply charging interest on a loan. At other times it implies an unduly high rate of interest. Under the law of Moses, Israel was forbidden to charge usury, as in [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 22#^verse-25|Ex. 22:25]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 25#^verse-35|Lev. 25:35-38]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 23#^verse-19|Deut. 23:19-21]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 5#^verse-1|Neh. 5:1-13]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 18#^verse-8|Ezek. 18:8]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 22#^verse-12|22:12]]. The restriction, however, seems to be when lending to a fellow church member. There is no clear restriction against charges for loans to others. Jesus gives some credence to interest charges in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25#^verse-14|Matt. 25:14-30]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 19#^verse-12|Luke 19:12-27]]. Latter-day revelation does not contain restrictions against interest charges.
