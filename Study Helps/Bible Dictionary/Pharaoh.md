 (See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Egypt|Egypt]].) The title given to the Egyptian kings; its meaning is "Great House." Nine or ten different Pharaohs are mentioned in the Old Testament, belonging to several different dynasties.

(2) Pharaoh (also one of the Hyksos) and Joseph ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 39|Gen. 39-50]]). (3) The Pharaohs of oppression, Seti â  and Ramses â¡, belonging to the 19th dynasty ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 1|Ex. 1]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 2|2]]); it is generally believed that the Pharaoh of the Exodus was Mer-ne-ptah, but the discovery of the Tell el-Amarna tablets has thrown doubt on this. (4) The Pharaoh whose daughter Solomon married, perhaps Pi-netchem of the 21st dynasty ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 3#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 3:1]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 7#^verse-8|7:8]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 9#^verse-16|9:16, 24]]). (5) Shishak or Sheshonk, of the 22nd dynasty, who befriended Jeroboam. (6) So (Shabakah) with whom Hoshea makes alliance ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 17#^verse-4|2 Kgs. 17:4]]). (7) Pharaoh Necho, who defeated Josiah at Megiddo ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23#^verse-29|2 Kgs. 23:29-35]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 25#^verse-19|Jer. 25:19]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 46#^verse-17|46:17, 25]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 47#^verse-1|47:1]]). (8) Pharaoh Hophra, who sent an army to the assistance of Zedekiah ([[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 37#^verse-5|Jer. 37:5-11]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 43#^verse-9|43:9]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 17#^verse-17|Ezek. 17:17]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 29#^verse-2|29:2-3]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 30#^verse-21|30:21-25]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 31#^verse-2|31:2, 18]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 32#^verse-2|32:2, 31-32]]).
