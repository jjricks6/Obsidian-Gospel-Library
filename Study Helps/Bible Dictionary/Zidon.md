 Fisher's town (sometimes spelled Sidon). In ancient times it was the most important city of Phoenicia (hence Phoenicians are generally called Zidonians in the Old Testament). It was on the border of Asher ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 19#^verse-28|Josh. 19:28]]) but was never occupied by that tribe ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 1#^verse-31|Judg. 1:31]]). The town is now known as Saida, midway between Tyre and Beyrout (Beirut).
