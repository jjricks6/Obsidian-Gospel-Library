 The distance it was supposed that the law allowed a man to walk on the Sabbath; the rabbis, by means of a forced and unnatural interpretation of [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 16#^verse-29|Ex. 16:29]], fixed this at 2,000 cubits, being the distance between the Ark and the people during the march in the wilderness ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 3#^verse-4|Josh. 3:4]]), and also, according to tradition, the distance between the tabernacle and the furthest part of the camp. See also [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1#^verse-12|Acts 1:12]].
