 There are various references in the New Testament to the use of hymns, such as in the account of the Last Supper ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 26#^verse-30|Matt. 26:30]]), where the hymn would be part of the Hallel ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 113|Ps. 113-18]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 4#^verse-24|Acts 4:24]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 16#^verse-25|16:25]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 14#^verse-15|1 Cor. 14:15, 26]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 5#^verse-19|Eph. 5:19]]; [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 3#^verse-16|Col. 3:16]]; [[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-13|James 5:13]]). Psalmody and hymnody were highly developed in the religious services of the Jews and were thus easily continued in Christian worship. The Gospel hymns, such as the Magnificat ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-46|Luke 1:46-55]]), the Benedictus ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-68|1:68-79]]), the Gloria in Excelsis ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-14|2:14]]), and the Nunc Dimittis ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2#^verse-29|2:29-32]]), have from early times been used in public worship.
