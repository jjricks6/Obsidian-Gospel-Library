 A mountain reached by the Israelites three months after the Exodus. Its site has been much disputed, and some scholars maintain that it was in the country of Edom. It probably was in the southern part of the peninsula between the gulfs of Suez and Aqabah and is to be identified with one of the peaks of Jebel Musa. It was an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Babylonian moongod Sin, from whom the name is derived. Here the Ten Commandments were given to Israel by God through Moses and the tabernacle was built. It was while Moses was in the mount with God that the people made themselves a golden calf to worship. The encampment at Sinai lasted somewhat more than a year ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 1#^verse-1|Num. 1:1]]).
