 A walled city in the valley of the Jordan, 800 feet below the Mediterranean, near the place where the Israelites crossed the river on their first entry into the promised land ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 2#^verse-1|Josh. 2:1-3]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 3#^verse-16|3:16]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 6|6]]). Joshua placed a curse upon it ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 6#^verse-26|Josh. 6:26]]), which was afterwards fulfilled ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 16#^verse-34|1 Kgs. 16:34]]). It was within the territory assigned to Benjamin ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 18#^verse-12|Josh. 18:12, 21]]) and was visited by our Lord on His last journey to Jerusalem ([[New Testament/Mark/Mark 10#^verse-46|Mark 10:46]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 18#^verse-35|Luke 18:35]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 19#^verse-1|19:1]]).
