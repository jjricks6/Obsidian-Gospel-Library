 First mentioned in [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 4#^verse-2|Gen. 4:2]]; some laws pertaining to it are found in [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 19#^verse-9|Lev. 19:9-10, 19]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 23#^verse-10|23:10-14, 22]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 25#^verse-3|25:3-7, 11, 18-22]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 24#^verse-19|Deut. 24:19-22]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 25#^verse-4|25:4]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 26|26]]. Cultivation of the vine and olive, two of the most important products of Palestine, necessarily implies a settled life and could not be practiced by wandering tribes. In addition to the vine and olive, various kinds of cereal grains were extensively cultivated. The plowshare and the pruninghook together represent agriculture ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 2#^verse-4|Isa. 2:4]]; [[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 3#^verse-10|Joel 3:10]]). Among other implements of husbandry mentioned are the sickle, the threshing instrument, the winnowing shovel, and the winnowing fork. Grain was either simply parched ([[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 2#^verse-14|Ruth 2:14]]), pounded in a mortar ([[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 27#^verse-22|Prov. 27:22]]), or ground in a handmill made of two slabs of stone that were placed one upon another. The work of grinding was usually performed by slaves, often by female slaves, and hence came to be regarded as degrading ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 16#^verse-21|Judg. 16:21]]; [[Old Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations 5#^verse-13|Lam. 5:13]]). Thus Isaiah, addressing Babylon, bids her descend from the throne and grind meal ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 47#^verse-2|Isa. 47:2]]). Mention is also made of millstones ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 18#^verse-6|Matt. 18:6]]); large and heavy, they were turned by the use of animals.
