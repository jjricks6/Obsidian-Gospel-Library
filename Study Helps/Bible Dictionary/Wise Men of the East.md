 [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 2#^verse-1|Matt. 2:1-12]] states that wise men (how many is not recorded), guided by a new star, came to Bethlehem to worship Jesus sometime after His birth. Who these men were we are not told, but it is certain they were not ordinary men. That they were privileged to search out the Son of God and give Him gifts, and that they were spiritually sensitive and knowledgeable, suggests that they were actually prophets on a divine errand. The customary identification of them as astrologers is a gross misrepresentation. They evidently were holy men from a land east of Palestine. See also [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Magi|Magi]].
