 Given to God. The word describes anything dedicated to God and therefore not available for ordinary uses. The utterance of it was held to constitute a binding vow, and the fulfillment of a vow was regarded by the Pharisees as of deeper obligation than the duty even to parents. See [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 15#^verse-5|Matt. 15:5]] and [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 7#^verse-11|Mark 7:11]], where it appears that the Pharisees misused the opportunity of dedicating their material possessions to God, in order to avoid responsibility to care for their parents.
