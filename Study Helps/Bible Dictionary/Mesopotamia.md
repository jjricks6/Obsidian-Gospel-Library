 Hebrew Aram-naharaim (see [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 60|Ps. 60 heading]]), Aram of the two rivers (Euphrates and Tigris), the name being specially applied to the fruitful country between the upper parts of these two rivers. In this region Nahor settled after leaving Ur of the Chaldees ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 24#^verse-10|Gen. 24:10]]); and here other members of the family remained after Abraham had moved on into Canaan. See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Aram, Arameans|Aram]].
