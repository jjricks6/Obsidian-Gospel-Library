 The shepherd's sling that we associate with David ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 17#^verse-40|1 Sam. 17:40-50]]) and with the men of Benjamin ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 20#^verse-16|Judg. 20:16]]) was made of a pad to which were fastened two strings or thongs of leather. The pad for the stone was made of woven material or leather. One of the thongs would often be fitted with loops in which to insert one's fingers. With a stone placed in the pad the sling would be swung around the head. When one of the strings was let go, the stone would fly out of its place to its mark. With practice, a person could become very accurate in casting stones in this manner. Flint slingstones have been found measuring three inches in diameter.
