 Palestine has little mineral wealth, though [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 8#^verse-9|Deut. 8:9]] shows mining was to some extent carried on. There are some iron and coal mines in the Lebanon, while in the Sinai peninsula copper, iron, and manganese are found. The precious stones, to which there are many allusions in the Old Testament, were imported for the most part from southern Arabia.
