 Hairy. Elder son of Isaac and twin brother of Jacob. The two brothers were rivals from their birth and became the ancestors of rival nations, the Israelites and Edomites. Esau sold to Jacob his birthright ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 25#^verse-33|Gen. 25:33]]), by which he lost both the leadership of the tribe and also the covenant blessing ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 27#^verse-28|Gen. 27:28-29, 36]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12#^verse-16|Heb. 12:16-17]]). He married against the wishes of his parents ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 26#^verse-34|Gen. 26:34-35]]; see also [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-9|28:9]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 36#^verse-2|36:2]]) and settled in Mount Seir. He was living there on Jacob's return from Padan-aram ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 32#^verse-3|Gen. 32:3-32]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 35#^verse-1|35:1, 29]]). By that time he saw clearly that the covenant blessing and the land of Canaan would not be his, and the brothers separated in friendly fashion. Of Esau's subsequent history nothing is known. For his descendants, see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Edom|Edom]].
