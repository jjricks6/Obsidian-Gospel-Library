 An important river that rises in the mountains of Armenia and falls into the Persian Gulf, frequently called in scripture "the River." It provided a route of communication between east and west. It was the boundary of the land promised to the seed of Abraham ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 15#^verse-18|Gen. 15:18]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 1#^verse-7|Deut. 1:7]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 1#^verse-4|Josh. 1:4]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 5#^verse-9|1 Chr. 5:9]]); this boundary was reached in the time of David ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-3|2 Sam. 8:3]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 18#^verse-3|1 Chr. 18:3]]). The stronghold of Carchemish was built at the ford of the river and was a position of great importance in military operations ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 35#^verse-20|2 Chr. 35:20]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 46#^verse-2|Jer. 46:2]]). On the banks of the Euphrates stood the great city of Babylon.
