 The Lord raiseth up. King of Judah (609-598 B.C.), originally called Eliakim ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23#^verse-34|2 Kgs. 23:34-36]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 24#^verse-1|24:1-6, 19]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 3#^verse-15|1 Chr. 3:15-16]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 36#^verse-4|2 Chr. 36:4-5, 8]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 1#^verse-3|Jer. 1:3]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 22#^verse-18|22:18, 24]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 26#^verse-1|26:1, 21-23]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 27#^verse-1|27:1, 20]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 28#^verse-4|28:4]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 35#^verse-1|35:1]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 36#^verse-1|36:1, 9, 28-32]]). Jehoiakim was son of Joash, king of Judah, and brother of Zedekiah. He was not a faithful ruler; an interesting event is told of him burning the manuscript of one of the prophecies of Jeremiah ([[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 36#^verse-1|Jer. 36:1-26]]), whereupon Jeremiah wrote the prophecy again. Jehoiakim was given a dishonorable burial of an ass ([[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 22#^verse-18|Jer. 22:18-19]]). He was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, who in turn was succeeded by Zedekiah.
