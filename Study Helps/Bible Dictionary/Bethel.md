 House of God. (1) Formerly called Luz ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-19|Gen. 28:19]]), on the border between Benjamin and Ephraim, and one of the most sacred spots in Israel. Here Abraham built his altar on his first arrival in Canaan ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 12#^verse-8|Gen. 12:8]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 13#^verse-3|13:3]]); here Jacob had his dream, set up a pillar, and gave the place its name ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-19|28:19]]).
