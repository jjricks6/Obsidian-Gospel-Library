 These terms are used in various combinations and with varying meanings. Generally speaking, the kingdom of God on the earth is the Church. It is a preparation for the greater kingdomâ€”the celestial or kingdom of heaven. This is the manner in which these terms are used in [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 65|D&C 65]]. However, kingdom of heaven is sometimes used in scripture to mean the Church (as in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 3#^verse-2|Matt. 3:2]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4#^verse-17|4:17]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 13|13]]; and [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25#^verse-1|25:1-13]]), meaning that the true church on the earth is the path to heaven and is the kingdom of heaven on earth.

 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the kingdom of God on the earth but is at the present limited to an ecclesiastical kingdom. During the millennial era, the kingdom of God will be both political and ecclesiastical (see [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 7#^verse-18|Dan. 7:18, 22, 27]]; [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 11#^verse-15|Rev. 11:15]]; [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Revelation/JST, Revelation 12#^verse-1|JST Rev. 12:1-3, 7 [Appendix]]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 65|D&C 65]]) and will have worldwide jurisdiction in political realms when the Lord has made "a full end of all nations" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 87#^verse-6|D&C 87:6]]).
