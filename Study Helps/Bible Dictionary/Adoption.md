 There are two types of adoption spoken of in the scriptures. A person who is of non-Israelite lineage becomes a member of the house of Israel through faith in Jesus Christ when it is accompanied by baptism in water and the reception of the Holy Ghost. In addition, all candidates for the fulness of salvation are accounted as sons and daughters of Jesus Christ, being His children by obedience to the gospel ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 5#^verse-7|Mosiah 5:7-8]]). Although the word adoption is not actually used by John the Baptist, he taught the concept as recorded in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 3#^verse-9|Matt. 3:9]] and [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-8|Luke 3:8]] (compare [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Matthew/JST, Matthew 3#^verse-36|JST Matt. 3:36 [Appendix]]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-8|JST Luke 3:8 [Luke 3:8 note d]]]). See also [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8#^verse-15|Rom. 8:15-17]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-5|Gal. 4:5-7]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 1#^verse-5|Eph. 1:5]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-10|Abr. 2:10]].
