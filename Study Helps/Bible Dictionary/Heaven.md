 This term has several meanings in the scriptures. It is first of all the place where God lives and the future home of the saints ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-12|Gen. 28:12]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 11#^verse-4|Ps. 11:4]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-9|Matt. 6:9]]). It also means the expanse around the earth, as the heavens ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 1#^verse-1|Gen. 1:1, 17]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24#^verse-10|Ex. 24:10]]). It is usually thought of as being "up," or above the earth ([[New Testament/John/John 3#^verse-13|John 3:13]]; see also [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 18#^verse-30|Alma 18:30-32]]). In the sense of being God's home and the ultimate place for the faithful, it is clearly distinguished from paradise, which is the temporary abode of the faithful spirits of persons who have lived and died on this earth. Jesus visited paradise after His death on the cross, but on the third day thereafter, He informed Mary that He had not yet been to the Father (see [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23#^verse-39|Luke 23:39-44]]; [[New Testament/John/John 20#^verse-17|John 20:17]]).
