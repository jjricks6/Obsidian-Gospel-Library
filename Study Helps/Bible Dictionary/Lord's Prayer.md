 So called because it was taught by our Lord to His disciples. Matthew ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-9|6:9-13]]) includes it in the Sermon on the Mount, while Luke ([[New Testament/Luke/Luke 11#^verse-1|11:1-5]]) tells us that it was given by our Lord in answer to a request from one of His disciples. There are some small differences in the form in which the two disciples have recorded the prayer; these may be accounted for by supposing that they themselves did not always use exactly the same words in saying the prayer. A slightly different rendition is found in [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 13#^verse-9|3 Ne. 13:9-13]]; and further variations are to be seen in JST Matt. 6:9-15 (see [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6#^verse-13|Matt. 6:13 note a]]).
