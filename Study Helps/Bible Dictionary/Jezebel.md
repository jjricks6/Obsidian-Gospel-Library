 A Phoenician princess, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidonians, and wife of Ahab, king of Israel ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 16#^verse-31|1 Kgs. 16:31]]). This marriage, more than any other single event, caused the downfall of the northern kingdom, as Jezebel introduced into Israel the worst forms of Phoenician worship in place of the worship of Jehovah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-4|1 Kgs. 18:4, 13, 19]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 19#^verse-1|19:1-2]]; see also [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 21#^verse-5|21:5-25]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 9|2 Kgs. 9]]). In [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 2#^verse-20|Rev. 2:20]] the name is applied figuratively to a woman (or sect) causing great harm to the Church in Thyatira.
