 Peace. The home of Melchizedek ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 14#^verse-18|Gen. 14:18]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 7#^verse-1|Heb. 7:1-2]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 13#^verse-17|Alma 13:17-18]]). Salem was called Jebus at the time the Israelites came into Canaan. However, the Tell el-Amarna tablets of about 1400 B.C. give the name of the city as Uru-Salem (an older name than Jebus), which is easily identified as Jerusalem, the "City of Peace," the city of Melchizedek about 2000 B.C.
