 God heareth. Son of Abraham and Hagar the Egyptian ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 16#^verse-11|Gen. 16:11-16]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 17#^verse-18|17:18-26]]). He was the child "born after the flesh" ([[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-23|Gal. 4:23]]) and not the child "by promise" and was sent from home after mocking Isaac ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 21#^verse-8|Gen. 21:8-21]]; see also [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 25#^verse-9|25:9-17]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-9|28:9]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 36#^verse-3|36:3]]). His descendants, the Ishmaelites, appear to have been a wandering race ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 16#^verse-12|16:12]]), living by plunder, having commercial relations and intermarrying with the heathen nations of Canaan ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 37#^verse-25|Gen. 37:25-28]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 39#^verse-1|39:1]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 8#^verse-24|Judg. 8:24]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 83#^verse-6|Ps. 83:6]]; see also [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-21|Gal. 4:21-5:1]]).
