 From the Hebrew Yarah, meaning "to cast," as to put forth instruction. One form of the verb also means to point out, show, and thus to direct, instruct. The Torah is thus divine direction and instruction; it includes the law, particularly the five books of Moses, and takes precedence over other books of the Old Testament to most Jewish people. Torah scrolls are often elaborately made and protected by a cloth or metal case.
