 Denotes changing one's views, in a conscious acceptance of the will of God ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3#^verse-19|Acts 3:19]]). If followed by continued faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism in water for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, conversion will become complete and will change a natural man into a sanctified, born again, purified personâ€”a new creature in Christ Jesus (see [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 5#^verse-17|2 Cor. 5:17]]). Complete conversion comes after many trials and much testing (see [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 22#^verse-32|Luke 22:32]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 112#^verse-12|D&C 112:12-13]]). To labor for the conversion of one's self and others is a noble task, as in [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 51#^verse-13|Ps. 51:13]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 12#^verse-3|Dan. 12:3]]; [[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-19|James 5:19-20]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 26|Alma 26]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 18#^verse-15|D&C 18:15-16]].
