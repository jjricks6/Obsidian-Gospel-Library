 One who prevails with God or Let God prevail. This name was given to Jacob at Penuel ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 32#^verse-28|Gen. 32:28]]) and at Bethel ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 35#^verse-10|Gen. 35:10]]). It also applies to his descendants and to their kingdom ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 1#^verse-24|2 Sam. 1:24]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 23#^verse-3|23:3]]). After the division of the kingdom, the northern tribes, as the larger part, retained the name Israel, while the southern kingdom was called Judah. The land of Canaan is also called Israel today. And in another sense Israel means the true believer in Christ, as explained by Paul ([[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10#^verse-1|Rom. 10:1]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 11#^verse-7|11:7]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 6#^verse-16|Gal. 6:16]]; [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 2#^verse-12|Eph. 2:12]]). The name Israel is therefore variously used to denote (1) the man Jacob, (2) the literal descendants of Jacob, and (3) the true believers in Christ, regardless of their lineage or geographical location.
