It was afterwards known as Petra. There are still important buildings there belonging to the Roman period.

 (2) A musical term that occurs 71 times in the Psalms and three times in Habakkuk. Its meaning is uncertain. Most likely it is a direction to the musicians to strike up, either with a louder accompaniment or with an interlude while the singing ceased.
