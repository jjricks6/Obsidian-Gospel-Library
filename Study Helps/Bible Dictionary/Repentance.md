 The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined. Without this there can be no progress in the things of the soul's salvation, for all accountable persons are stained by sin and must be cleansed in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. Repentance is not optional for salvation; it is a commandment of God ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 18#^verse-9|D&C 18:9-22]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-29|20:29]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 133#^verse-16|133:16]]). The preaching of repentance by John the Baptist formed the preparation for the ministry of our Lord.
