 "A seer is a revelator and a prophet also" ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 8#^verse-15|Mosiah 8:15-16]]), and when necessary he can use the Urim and Thummim or holy interpreters ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 8#^verse-13|Mosiah 8:13]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 28#^verse-16|28:16]]). There have been many seers in the history of God's people on this earth but not so many as there have been prophets. "A seer is greater than a prophet ... and a gift which is greater can no man have ..." ([[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 8#^verse-15|Mosiah 8:15-18]]). Joseph Smith is the great seer of the latter days. In addition, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators.
