 Name of God. Son of Elkanah and Hannah, born in answer to his mother's prayers ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 1|1 Sam. 1]]); as a child placed in Eli's charge at the tabernacle at Shiloh ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 2#^verse-11|2:11]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 3#^verse-1|3:1]]). After Eli's death he became the great prophet and judge of Israel, and restored law and order and regular religious worship in the land ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 7#^verse-2|7:2-17]]). After Saul had been appointed king (see [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 8|8]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 9#^verse-14|9:14-10:25]]), Samuel seems to have ceased to act as judge, but he continued to be the prophet and representative of Jehovah. The following are the chief events belonging to this later period of his life: he calls the people to witness to his own integrity ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 12|1 Sam. 12]]); reproves Saul for his presumption ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 13#^verse-8|13:8-15]]); bids Saul destroy the Amalekites, and reproves him for his disobedience ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 15|1 Sam. 15]]); anoints David ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 16#^verse-1|16:1-13]]); receives David at Naioth ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 19#^verse-18|19:18]]); his death ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 25#^verse-1|25:1]]). There are also references to him in [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 6#^verse-28|1 Chr. 6:28]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 9#^verse-22|9:22]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 11#^verse-3|11:3]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 26#^verse-28|26:28]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 29#^verse-29|29:29]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 35#^verse-18|2 Chr. 35:18]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 99#^verse-6|Ps. 99:6]]; [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 15#^verse-1|Jer. 15:1]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3#^verse-24|Acts 3:24]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-20|13:20]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-32|Heb. 11:32]]. Though not a priest, he performed priestly functions and constantly offered sacrifice at various places. His old age was saddened by the willfulness of Saul, and he is a signal example of faith, patience, integrity, and self-sacrifice through a long and trying career.

 The account in [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 28#^verse-5|1 Sam. 28:5-20]] of the prophet being brought back from the dead by the witch of Endor, at King Saul's request, presents a problem. It is certain that a witch or other medium cannot by any means available to her bring up a prophet from the world of spirits. We may confidently be assured that if Samuel was present on that occasion, it was not due to conjuring of the witch. Either Samuel came in spite of and not because of the witch, or some other spirit came impersonating him.
