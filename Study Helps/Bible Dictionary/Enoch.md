 The seventh from Adam. Son of Jared, and father of Methuselah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5#^verse-18|Gen. 5:18-24]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-37|Luke 3:37]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-5|Heb. 11:5]]). The biblical account of Enoch is scanty. It tells us that he was translated but gives nothing of the details of his ministry. A quotation from his prophecy is found in [[New Testament/Jude#^verse-14|Jude 1:14]]. From latter-day revelation we learn much more of Enoch; specifically of his preaching, his city called Zion, his visions, and his prophecies. See [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-48|D&C 107:48-57]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6|Moses 6-7]]. From these sources we observe that he was a preacher of righteousness and a vigorous exponent of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We also note that not only Enoch but also his entire city was translated. We also become aware that Enoch was a much greater person with a far more significant ministry than one would ever suppose from the Bible alone.

 There are at least three apocalyptic works purporting to be books of Enoch; these are included in the category usually called "pseudepigrapha," meaning writings under assumed names, compiled long after the time of the supposed author. On the basis of latter-day revelation it appears there are some truths contained in the apocalyptic Enoch books. See also [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Pseudepigrapha|Pseudepigrapha]].
