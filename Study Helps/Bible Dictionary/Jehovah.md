 The covenant or proper name of the God of Israel. It denotes the "Unchangeable One," "the eternal I Am" ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 6#^verse-3|Ex. 6:3]]; [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 83#^verse-18|Ps. 83:18]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 12#^verse-2|Isa. 12:2]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 26#^verse-4|26:4]]). The original pronunciation of this name has possibly been lost, as the Jews, in reading, never mentioned it but substituted one of the other names of God, usually Adonai. Probably it was pronounced Jahveh, or Yahveh. In the KJV, the Jewish custom has been followed, and the name is generally denoted by Lord or God, printed in small capitals.

 Jehovah is the premortal Jesus Christ and came to earth being born of Mary (see [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 3#^verse-8|Mosiah 3:8]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 15#^verse-1|15:1]]; [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 15#^verse-1|3 Ne. 15:1-5]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 110#^verse-1|D&C 110:1-10]]). Although [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 6#^verse-3|Ex. 6:3]] states that the God of Israel was not known by the name Jehovah before Moses' time, latter-day revelation tells us otherwise; see [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 6#^verse-3|JST Ex. 6:3 (Ex. 6:3 note c)]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 1#^verse-16|Abr. 1:16]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-8|2:8]]; see also [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 22#^verse-14|Gen. 22:14]].
