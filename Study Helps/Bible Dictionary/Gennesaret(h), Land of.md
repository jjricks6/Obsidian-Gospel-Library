 The fertile plain on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, toward the northern end, 1 mile broad and 2Â½ miles long, 500 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. In our Lord's day it was considered the best part of Galilee, but it became desolate and uncultivated until the rise of modern Israel ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14#^verse-34|Matt. 14:34]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 6#^verse-53|Mark 6:53]]). The "lake of Gennesaret" refers to the Sea of Galilee. See [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Galilee, Sea of|Galilee, Sea of]].
