 Judge of Israel; for his history see [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 11|Judg. 11-12]]. He is chiefly known for his rash vow, in consequence of which he offered his own daughter in sacrifice. He is commended in [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-32|Heb. 11:32]], probably because of his delivery of Israel from Ammon.
