 My messenger. The prophecy of Malachi was spoken about 430 B.C. The first part ([[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 1#^verse-1|Mal. 1:1-2:9]]) is addressed to the priesthood, reproving them for their neglect of service to God. The second part ([[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 2#^verse-10|2:10-4:6]]) is addressed to the people, speaking against marriage outside the covenant, divorces from wives within the covenant, and neglect of tithe paying, and reproving the general spirit of discontent. The faithful are encouraged to remain so, with the assurance that the Lord is mindful of them, and the disobedient shall fail in the day of the Lord's coming. Notable passages are [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 3#^verse-1|3:1]], which is quoted in [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11#^verse-10|Matt. 11:10]] as having reference to John the Baptist; [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 3#^verse-7|Mal. 3:7-12]], an exposition of the law of tithing; [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4#^verse-1|4:1]], which speaks of the Second Coming of the Lord; and [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4#^verse-5|4:5-6]], which deals with the return of Elijah (cited also in [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 2|D&C 2]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 128#^verse-17|128:17]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Joseph Smith—History#^verse-37|JS—H 1:37-39]]). All of [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 3|Mal. 3]] and [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4|4]] was quoted by the Savior to the Nephites, as recorded in [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 24|3 Ne. 24]] and [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 25|25]].
