 The name Adam is given to the first man of the human family on this earth as cited in the account of the Creation in the books of Genesis, Moses, and Abraham and in many instances in the New Testament, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. From these scriptures we learn that Adam is the father and patriarch of the human race on the earth. The aggregate of the scriptures certifies that his transgression in the garden of Eden, although designated as a "fall," was necessary to the advancement and spiritual progress of humanity on this earth, and Adam rightly should be honored, not denigrated. Adam is the Ancient of Days and is also known as Michael. He is the archangel and will come again to the earth in power and glory as the patriarch of the human family preparatory to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 7#^verse-9|Dan. 7:9-14]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 116|D&C 116]]; HC 3:385-87; 4:207-8).

 From latter-day revelation we learn that Adam had a pure and perfect language that was both written and spoken ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-5|Moses 6:5-6]]); that he was taught the gospel of Jesus Christ ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-51|Moses 6:51-63]]); that he was baptized in water and received the Holy Ghost ([[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 6#^verse-64|Moses 6:64-68]]); and that he was visited personally by the Lord ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-55|D&C 107:55-56]]). Other references to Adam include [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 3#^verse-38|Luke 3:38]]; [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 5#^verse-12|Rom. 5:12-21]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11#^verse-9|1 Cor. 11:9]]; [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 15#^verse-20|15:20-22, 45-49]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 2#^verse-13|1 Tim. 2:13]]; [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2#^verse-20|2 Ne. 2:20-26]]; [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 3#^verse-11|Mosiah 3:11, 16]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 29#^verse-34|D&C 29:34-44]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 107#^verse-41|107:41-57]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 2|Moses 2-6]].
