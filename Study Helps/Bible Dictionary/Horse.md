 Most of the allusions to horses that occur in the Bible refer to their use in war. They were not used at all by the early Hebrews; Solomon introduced them from Egypt. The Canaanites, in the time of Joshua, made use of war-horses and chariots ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 11#^verse-9|Josh. 11:9]]), but they could only be used in plains and level country. In [[Old Testament/Job/Job 39#^verse-19|Job 39:19-25]] there is a description of a war-horse. There is only one allusion to the horse being employed for agricultural purposes among the Jews, namely, for threshing grain ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 28#^verse-28|Isa. 28:28]]).
