 Care should be taken to distinguish between two different uses of this word. The "fear of the Lord" is frequently spoken of as part of man's duty ([[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 111#^verse-10|Ps. 111:10]]; [[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes/Ecclesiastes 12#^verse-13|Eccl. 12:13]]; [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 11#^verse-2|Isa. 11:2-3]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 1#^verse-50|Luke 1:50]]); it is also described as "godly fear" ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12#^verse-28|Heb. 12:28]]). In such passages fear is equivalent to reverence, awe, worship, and is therefore an essential part of the attitude of mind in which we ought to stand toward the All-holy God. On the other hand fear is spoken of as something unworthy of a child of God, something that "perfect love casteth out" ([[New Testament/1 John/1 John 4#^verse-18|1 Jn. 4:18]]). The first effect of Adam's sin was that he was afraid ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3#^verse-10|Gen. 3:10]]). Sin destroys that feeling of confidence God's child should feel in a loving Father and produces instead a feeling of shame and guilt. Ever since the Fall God has been teaching men not to fear, but with penitence to ask forgiveness in full confidence of receiving it.
