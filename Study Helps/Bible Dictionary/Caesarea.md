 An important seaport town of Palestine, on the main road from Tyre to Egypt, 33 miles north of Joppa, and about 60 miles from Jerusalem. Built by Herod the Great, it was the official residence of Festus, Felix, and other Roman prefects and procurators of Judea ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 23#^verse-23|Acts 23:23, 33]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 25#^verse-1|25:1-13]]). Philip worked in Caesarea ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8#^verse-40|Acts 8:40]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-8|21:8, 16]]). It was there that Cornelius, the gentile centurion, was baptized by Peter ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10#^verse-1|Acts 10:1, 24]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 11#^verse-11|11:11]]), and that Herod Agrippa died ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 12#^verse-23|Acts 12:23]]). Caesarea is also frequently mentioned in connection with Paul's journeys ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-30|Acts 9:30]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 18#^verse-22|18:22]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21#^verse-8|21:8, 16]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 23#^verse-23|23:23, 33]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 25#^verse-1|25:1, 4, 6, 13]]).
