 Judge. Son of Bilhah, Rachel's maid, and brother to Naphtali. After the settlement in Canaan, the district assigned to the tribe of Dan was small in area but had an admirable situation, adjoining Ephraim, Benjamin, and Judah, parts of it being extremely fertile ([[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 19#^verse-40|Josh. 19:40-48]]). There was a good deal of difficulty in holding it against the Amorites ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 1#^verse-34|Judg. 1:34]]) and against the Philistines ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 13#^verse-2|Judg. 13:2, 25]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18#^verse-1|18:1]]). Consequently the Danites made for themselves a settlement in the north of Palestine ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 18|Judg. 18]]), around Laish, to which city they gave the name of Dan. This town is well known as the northern limit of Palestine, which extended "from Dan even to Beer-sheba." It was chosen by Jeroboam as one of the places in which to establish the calf worship for the northern tribes ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12#^verse-29|1 Kgs. 12:29]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 10#^verse-29|2 Kgs. 10:29]]). The city was laid waste by Benhadad ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 15#^verse-20|1 Kgs. 15:20]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 16#^verse-4|2 Chr. 16:4]]); and Jewish tradition records that the calf was carried off to Assyria by Tiglath-pileser ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 15#^verse-29|2 Kgs. 15:29]]). The reason for the omission of the tribe of Dan in John's list in [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 7#^verse-5|Rev. 7:5-7]] is not known. Its character is sketched in the blessings of Jacob and Moses ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49#^verse-16|Gen. 49:16-18]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33#^verse-22|Deut. 33:22]]).
