 Son of Solomon by the Ammonite princess Naamah ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-21|1 Kgs. 14:21, 31]]), and his successor in the kingdom ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-43|1 Kgs. 11:43]]). During his reign the division took place between north and south ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12|1 Kgs. 12]]), being mainly the result of an old rivalry between Judah and Ephraim, which Rehoboam tried to pacify by going to Shechem to be crowned. Much discontent had also been caused by the rigor of Solomon's government, and by Rehoboam's refusal to relieve the burdens placed upon the people ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 12#^verse-1|1 Kgs. 12:1-11]]). An invasion by Shishak, king of Egypt, also weakened Rehoboam's power ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 14#^verse-21|1 Kgs. 14:21-31]]).
