 A judge (is) God. (1) The second son of David, by Abigail the Carmelitess ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 3#^verse-1|1 Chr. 3:1]]); also called Chileab ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 3#^verse-3|2 Sam. 3:3]]).

 (2) The hero of the book of Daniel. Nothing is known of his parentage, though he appears to have been of royal descent ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-3|Dan. 1:3]]); he was taken captive to Babylon and received the name of Belteshazzar ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-6|1:6-7]]). Along with three others he refused the "king's meat" from fear of defilement ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 1#^verse-8|1:8-16]]). He then won the favor of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius by his power of interpreting dreams ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 2|Dan. 2]]; [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 4|4]]) and the handwriting on the wall ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 5|Dan. 5]]). In consequence of a plot on the part of his enemies he was thrown into a den of lions ([[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 6|Dan. 6]]), but his life was preserved. There are references to him in [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 14#^verse-14|Ezek. 14:14, 20]]; [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 28#^verse-3|28:3]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-33|Heb. 11:33]]. Interesting points of resemblance may be noticed between the history of Daniel and that of Joseph.
