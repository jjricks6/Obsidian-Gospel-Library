 The phrase "light of Christ" does not appear in the Bible, although the principles that apply to it are frequently mentioned therein. The precise phrase is found in [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 28#^verse-14|Alma 28:14]], [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 7#^verse-18|Moro. 7:18]], and [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-7|D&C 88:7]]. Biblical phrases that are sometimes synonymous to the term "light of Christ" are "spirit of the Lord" and "light of life" (see, for example, [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-4|John 1:4]]; [[New Testament/John/John 8#^verse-12|8:12]]). The "spirit of the Lord," however, sometimes is used with reference to the Holy Ghost and so must not be taken in every case as having reference to the light of Christ.

 The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ. For instance, Christ is "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 93#^verse-2|D&C 93:2]]; see [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-9|John 1:9]]). The light of Christ fills the "immensity of space" and is the means by which Christ is able to be "in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things." It "giveth life to all things" and is "the law by which all things are governed." It is also "the light that quickeneth" man's understanding (see [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 88#^verse-6|D&C 88:6-13, 41]]). In this manner, the light of Christ is related to man's conscience and tells him right from wrong ([[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 7#^verse-12|Moro. 7:12-19]]).

 The light of Christ should not be confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ is not a personage at all. Its influence is preliminary to and preparatory to one's receiving the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ will lead the honest soul who "hearkeneth to the voice" to find the true gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost (see [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-46|D&C 84:46-48]]). Additional references are [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 19#^verse-6|Alma 19:6]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 26#^verse-3|26:3]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-27|D&C 20:27]].
