 Descendants of Levi. The work of ministering in the sanctuary was assigned to this tribe. The Levites are sometimes spoken of as distinct from the priests ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 8#^verse-4|1 Kgs. 8:4]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 2#^verse-70|Ezra 2:70]]; [[New Testament/John/John 1#^verse-19|John 1:19]]); sometimes as though all Levites were also priests, "the priests, the Levites" ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 18#^verse-1|Deut. 18:1]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 3#^verse-3|Josh. 3:3]]). The work of the Levites was to assist the priests ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 3#^verse-5|Num. 3:5-10]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 18#^verse-1|18:1-7]]). They acted as musicians ([[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 6#^verse-16|1 Chr. 6:16, 31]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 15#^verse-16|15:16]]; [[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 11#^verse-17|Neh. 11:17, 22]]); slaughtered the sacrifices ([[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 29#^verse-34|2 Chr. 29:34]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 35#^verse-11|35:11]]; [[Old Testament/Ezra/Ezra 6#^verse-20|Ezra 6:20]]); and generally assisted in the temple ([[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 11#^verse-16|Neh. 11:16, 19]]). The Levites were themselves offered as a wave-offering on behalf of the children of Israel ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 8#^verse-11|Num. 8:11-15]]); they thus became God's peculiar property, given to Him in place of the firstborn ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 8#^verse-16|8:16]]). They were cleansed for their office ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 8#^verse-7|8:7-16]]). They had no inheritance in Canaan ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 18#^verse-23|18:23-24]]); but they had the tithe ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 18#^verse-21|18:21]]), 48 cities ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 35#^verse-6|35:6]]), and a claim on the alms of the people at feast times ([[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12#^verse-18|Deut. 12:18-19]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 14#^verse-27|14:27-29]]).
