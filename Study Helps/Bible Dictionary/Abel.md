 A son of Adam and Eve; a shepherd who offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 4#^verse-4|Gen. 4:4]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-4|Heb. 11:4]]) and was killed by him out of jealousy and because Cain lusted after his flocks. Abel's sacrifice was accepted of the Lord because he was authorized by revelation to make the offering; and he performed it in faith, in the proper manner, by the proper authority, and for the proper reasons, his sacrifice being a type or symbol of the Redeemer ([[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11#^verse-4|Heb. 11:4]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 5#^verse-5|Moses 5:5-8, 17-36]]; HC 2:15-16; see also [[Study Helps/Joseph Smith Translation Appendix/JST, Genesis/JST, Genesis 17#^verse-7|JST Gen. 17:7 [Appendix]]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 23#^verse-35|Matt. 23:35]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12#^verse-24|Heb. 12:24]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-16|D&C 84:16]]).
