 Among early nations it was the custom to erect altars on hilltops ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 12#^verse-7|Gen. 12:7-8]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 22#^verse-2|22:2-4]]; [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 31#^verse-54|31:54]]). After the settlement in Canaan heathen altars were found set up on various hills and were ordered to be destroyed ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 33#^verse-52|Num. 33:52]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12#^verse-2|Deut. 12:2-3]]). Altars to Jehovah were built at several high places ([[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 6#^verse-25|Judg. 6:25-26]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 9#^verse-12|1 Sam. 9:12-25]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 10#^verse-5|10:5, 13]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 3#^verse-2|1 Kgs. 3:2-4]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 18#^verse-30|18:30]]; [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 21#^verse-26|1 Chr. 21:26]]). Such altars became local centers of the worship of Jehovah. When idolatry came in, many of these altars were desecrated and used for heathen worship. Religious reformers like Hezekiah and Josiah tried therefore to centralize the worship more and more in Jerusalem, where it could be better kept under control, and the high places were ordered to be removedâ€”no sacrifices were to be offered anywhere except in Jerusalem ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 18#^verse-4|2 Kgs. 18:4, 22]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 23|23]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 31#^verse-1|2 Chr. 31:1]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 34#^verse-3|34:3]]; see also [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 12#^verse-11|Deut. 12:11-14]]).
