 These were of two kinds: (a) dedication—some person or thing was given to the Lord ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 27#^verse-1|Lev. 27:1-24]]); (b) abstinence—a promise made to abstain from some lawful act or enjoyment ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 6#^verse-3|Num. 6:3]]). No unnatural mutilation was permitted ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 19#^verse-28|Lev. 19:28]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 14#^verse-1|Deut. 14:1]], etc.). Nothing already holy to the Lord, or intrinsically unholy, or blemished in the slightest degree, could be offered as a vow ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 22#^verse-23|Lev. 22:23]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 27#^verse-26|27:26]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 23#^verse-18|Deut. 23:18]]). Provisions were made for ransoming such offerings when they could not be fitly sacrificed ([[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 27#^verse-11|Lev. 27:11]]). The vows of dependent women (wives or daughters) did not stand unless ratified explicitly or implicitly by the husband or father ([[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 30#^verse-3|Num. 30:3-16]]; see also [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 44#^verse-19|Jer. 44:19]]). Vows often had an entreating character; they were offered in order to obtain some favor from Jehovah ([[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 28#^verse-20|Gen. 28:20]]; [[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 15#^verse-7|2 Sam. 15:7-8]]).
