 (More properly menorah, or lampstand.) Made for the tabernacle ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 25#^verse-31|Ex. 25:31-37]]; [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 37#^verse-17|37:17-24]]), placed on the south side, opposite the table of shewbread. From the main vertical stem three pairs of branches extended, curving upward so that all seven lamps on the ends were at the same level. In Solomon's temple there were 10 golden lampstands ([[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 7#^verse-49|1 Kgs. 7:49]]; [[Old Testament/2 Chronicles/2 Chronicles 4#^verse-7|2 Chr. 4:7]]). In the temple of Zerubbabel there was a single lampstand, afterwards carried off by Titus from the Herodian temple, and said to have been finally placed (A.D. 533) in a Christian church in Jerusalem. The metaphor in [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 11#^verse-36|1 Kgs. 11:36]], [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 18#^verse-28|Ps. 18:28]], and [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 2#^verse-5|Rev. 2:5]] refers to the eastern custom of keeping a lamp burning day and night.
