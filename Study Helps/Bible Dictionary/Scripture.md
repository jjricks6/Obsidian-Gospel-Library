 The word scripture means "a writing" and is used to denote a writing recognized by the Church as sacred and inspired. It is so applied to the books of the Old Testament by the writers of the New Testament ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 22#^verse-29|Matt. 22:29]]; [[New Testament/John/John 5#^verse-39|John 5:39]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 3#^verse-15|2 Tim. 3:15]]). For an account of the process by which the books of the Old Testament and New Testament came to be recognized as scripture, see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Canon|Canon]]. Latter-day revelation identifies scripture as that which is spoken under the influence of the Holy Ghost ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 68#^verse-1|D&C 68:1-4]]).
