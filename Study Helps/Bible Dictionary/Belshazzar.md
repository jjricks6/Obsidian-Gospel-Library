 Mentioned in [[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 5#^verse-1|Dan. 5:1-2]] as son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, being the last reigning king before the conquest by Cyrus. He has been usually identified with Nabonidus, but we learn from recently discovered monuments that Nabonidus had a son Belshazzar (Bel-sana-usur), who was never king, but was prince-regent during his father's reign.
