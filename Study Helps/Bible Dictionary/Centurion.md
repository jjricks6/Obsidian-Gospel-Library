 An officer of the Roman army, in command of a century, or company of 100 men, forming one-sixtieth part of a Roman legion. In New Testament times the legions were not up to their full strength, and a century varied from 50 to 100 men. At least five centurions are mentioned in the New Testament, of which perhaps the best known is Cornelius ([[New Testament/Acts/Acts 10#^verse-1|Acts 10:1-35]]).
