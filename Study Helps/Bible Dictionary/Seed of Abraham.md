 The heirs of the promises and covenants made to Abraham and obtained only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Men and women become heirs by faithfulness to covenant obligations whether they are literally of Abraham's lineage or by adoption. See [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 3#^verse-26|Gal. 3:26-29]]; [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4#^verse-1|4:1-7]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 84#^verse-34|D&C 84:34]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 103#^verse-17|103:17]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 132#^verse-30|132:30]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Abraham/Abraham 2#^verse-9|Abr. 2:9-11]]. Literal seed may also lose their blessings by disobedience, as in [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 9#^verse-6|Rom. 9:6-8]].
