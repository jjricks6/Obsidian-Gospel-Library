 The name indicated first of all a man of the kingdom of Judah, as distinguished from persons belonging to the northern kingdom of Israel. Its first chronological occurrence in the Bible is in [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 16#^verse-6|2 Kgs. 16:6]], about 740 B.C. It has become customary to use the word Jew to refer to all the descendants of Jacob, but this is a mistake. It would be limited to those of the kingdom of Judah or, more especially today, those of the tribe of Judah and his associates. Thus all Jews are Israelites, but not all Israelites are Jews, because there are descendants of the other tribes of Israel also upon the earth. See also [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 33#^verse-8|2 Ne. 33:8]].
