 (6) King of Macedon, surnamed the Great; born 356 B.C., died 323 B.C. He made himself ruler over a wide empire stretching from Greece to the Indus, including Syria and Egypt. Josephus records a meeting between him and the high priest Jaddua ([[Old Testament/Nehemiah/Nehemiah 12#^verse-11|Neh. 12:11, 22]]). This story is that Alexander was marching against Jerusalem when the high priest came to meet him in his robes of hyacinth and gold and accompanied by a train of priests and citizens arrayed in white. Alexander was so moved by the solemn spectacle that he did reverence to the high priest, visited Jerusalem, and conferred important privileges on the Jews.
