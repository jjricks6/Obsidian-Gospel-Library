 The word does not occur in the KJV. It is an English form of the Greek parakletos, a name applied by the Lord ([[New Testament/John/John 14#^verse-16|John 14:16, 26]]; [[New Testament/John/John 15#^verse-26|15:26]]; [[New Testament/John/John 16#^verse-7|16:7]]) to the Holy Spirit and that may be translated Comforter, Advocate, or Helper. The same name is applied by John ([[New Testament/1 John/1 John 2#^verse-1|1 Jn. 2:1]]) to the Lord Himself. Advocate is probably the English word that most nearly represents the meaning of the Greek.
