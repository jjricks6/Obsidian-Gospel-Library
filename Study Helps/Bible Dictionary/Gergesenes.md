 Men of Gergesa ([[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 8#^verse-28|Matt. 8:28]]). There is a difference of opinion as to the scene of the healing of the man with an unclean spirit; see [[Study Helps/Bible Dictionary/Gadara|Gadara]]. Gadara and Gerasa were well-known places, and these names might easily be substituted for the less well-known Gergesa, where the miracle was almost certainly worked, near the middle of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee; the modern name is Khersa.
