 Said to have been a succession of Jewish teachers between the prophets and the scribes (430-300 B.C.). Nehemiah was, according to tradition, its founder, and Simon the Just the last of its members, who numbered 120 in all. The Talmud attributes to this body the completion of the Old Testament canon, the compilation of the synagogue service, and the establishment of schools for the teaching of the law. There is no historical evidence in support of these traditions, and it is doubtful whether there ever existed such a body as the Great Synagogue at all.
