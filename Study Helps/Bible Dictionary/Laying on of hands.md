 A procedure used from the earliest times in the manner of blessing, conferring the Holy Ghost, and ordaining to the priesthood. See [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 48#^verse-14|Gen. 48:14, 17]]; [[Old Testament/Numbers/Numbers 27#^verse-18|Num. 27:18, 23]]; [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 34#^verse-9|Deut. 34:9]]; [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9#^verse-18|Matt. 9:18]]; [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 10#^verse-13|Mark 10:13, 16]]; [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 4#^verse-40|Luke 4:40]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 6#^verse-6|Acts 6:6]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8#^verse-14|8:14-17]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9#^verse-12|9:12, 17]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13#^verse-3|13:3]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 19#^verse-1|19:1-7]]; [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 28#^verse-8|28:8]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 4#^verse-14|1 Tim. 4:14]]; [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 5#^verse-22|5:22]]; [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1#^verse-6|2 Tim. 1:6]]; [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 6#^verse-2|Heb. 6:2]]; [[New Testament/James/James 5#^verse-14|James 5:14-16]]; [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 6#^verse-1|Alma 6:1]]; [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 2|Moro. 2]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 20#^verse-41|D&C 20:41, 58, 68, 70]]; [[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 36#^verse-1|36:1-2]]; [[Pearl of Great Price/Articles of Faith#^verse-5|A of F 1:5]]. Such procedure is in accord with the revealed will of the Lord and is not a mere formality. In latter-day revelation the laying on of hands is discussed by the Lord as follows: "I will lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit ..." ([[Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants/Doctrine and Covenants 36#^verse-2|D&C 36:2]]).

 The laying on of hands also formed part of the ritual of sacrifice under the law of Moses ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 29#^verse-10|Ex. 29:10, 15, 19]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 1#^verse-4|Lev. 1:4]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 3#^verse-2|3:2, 8, 13]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 4#^verse-4|4:4]]; [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 8#^verse-14|8:14]]).
