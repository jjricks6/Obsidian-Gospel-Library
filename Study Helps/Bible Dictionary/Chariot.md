 A vehicle, generally used for purposes of war ([[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 14#^verse-7|Ex. 14:7]]; [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 17#^verse-18|Josh. 17:18]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 1#^verse-19|Judg. 1:19]]; [[Old Testament/Judges/Judges 4#^verse-3|4:3]]; [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 13#^verse-5|1 Sam. 13:5]]). Up to the time of David the Israelites had few chariots ([[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 8#^verse-11|1 Sam. 8:11-12]]); in later times a regular force was maintained ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-4|2 Sam. 8:4]]; [[Old Testament/1 Kings/1 Kings 10#^verse-26|1 Kgs. 10:26]]). The armies that fought against Israel also had chariots, such as the Syrians ([[Old Testament/2 Samuel/2 Samuel 8#^verse-4|2 Sam. 8:4]]; [[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 8#^verse-21|2 Kgs. 8:21]]), the Assyrians ([[Old Testament/2 Kings/2 Kings 19#^verse-23|2 Kgs. 19:23]]), and the Persians ([[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 22#^verse-6|Isa. 22:6-7]]). The Israelite fighting chariot was probably after the Egyptian model, the plan of which is known from Egyptian paintings and reliefs still in existence.
