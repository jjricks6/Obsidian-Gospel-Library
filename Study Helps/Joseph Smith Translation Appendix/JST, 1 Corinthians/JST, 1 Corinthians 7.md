**1**  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me, saying, It is good for a man not to touch a woman. ^verse-1

**2**  Nevertheless, I say, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. ^verse-2

**5**  Depart ye not one from the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. ^verse-5

**26**  I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, for a man so to remain that he may do greater good. ^verse-26

**29**  But I speak unto you who are called unto the ministry. For this I say, brethren, the time that remaineth is but short, that ye shall be sent forth unto the ministry. Even they who have wives, shall be as though they had none; for ye are called and chosen to do the Lord's work. ^verse-29

**30**  And it shall be with them who weep, as though they wept not; and them who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not, and them who buy, as though they possessed not; ^verse-30

**31**  And them who use this world, as not using it; for the fashion of this world passeth away. ^verse-31

**32**  But I would, brethren, that ye magnify your calling. I would have you without carefulness. For he who is unmarried, careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord; therefore he prevaileth. ^verse-32

**33**  But he who is married, careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife; therefore there is a difference, for he is hindered. ^verse-33

**38**  So then he that giveth himself in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth himself not in marriage doeth better. ^verse-38
