**4**  And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar; and gave thanks unto the Lord, and rejoiced in his heart. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord spake unto Noah, and he blessed him. And Noah smelled a sweet savor, and he said in his heart; ^verse-5

**6**  I will call on the name of the Lord, that he will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; and that he will not again smite any more every thing living, as he hath done, while the earth remaineth; ^verse-6

**10**  But, the blood of all flesh which I have given you for meat, shall be shed upon the ground, which taketh life thereof, and the blood ye shall not eat. ^verse-10

**11**  And surely, blood shall not be shed, only for meat, to save your lives; and the blood of every beast will I require at your hands. ^verse-11

**12**  And whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man. ^verse-12

**13**  For a commandment I give, that every man's brother shall preserve the life of man, for in mine own image have I made man. ^verse-13

**14**  And a commandment I give unto you, Be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly on the earth, and multiply therein. ^verse-14

**15**  And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I will establish my covenant with you, which I made unto your father Enoch, concerning your seed after you. ^verse-15

**21**  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant, which I made unto thy father Enoch; that, when men should keep all my commandments, Zion should again come on the earth, the city of Enoch which I have caught up unto myself. ^verse-21

**22**  And this is mine everlasting covenant, that when thy posterity shall embrace the truth, and look upward, then shall Zion look downward, and all the heavens shall shake with gladness, and the earth shall tremble with joy; ^verse-22

**23**  And the general assembly of the church of the firstborn shall come down out of heaven, and possess the earth, and shall have place until the end come. And this is mine everlasting covenant, which I made with thy father Enoch. ^verse-23

**24**  And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will establish my covenant unto thee, which I have made between me and thee, for every living creature of all flesh that shall be upon the earth. ^verse-24

**25**  And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and thee; for all flesh that shall be upon the earth. ^verse-25
