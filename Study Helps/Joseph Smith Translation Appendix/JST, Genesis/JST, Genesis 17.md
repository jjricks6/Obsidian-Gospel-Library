**3**  And it came to pass, that Abram fell on his face, and called upon the name of the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  And God talked with him, saying, My people have gone astray from my precepts, and have not kept mine ordinances, which I gave unto their fathers; ^verse-4

**5**  And they have not observed mine anointing, and the burial, or baptism wherewith I commanded them; ^verse-5

**6**  But have turned from the commandment, and taken unto themselves the washing of children, and the blood of sprinkling; ^verse-6

**7**  And have said that the blood of the righteous Abel was shed for sins; and have not known wherein they are accountable before me. ^verse-7

**8**  But as for thee, behold, I will make my covenant with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. ^verse-8

**9**  And this covenant I make, that thy children may be known among all nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be called Abraham; for, a father of many nations have I made thee. ^verse-9

**10**  And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come of thee, and of thy seed. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will establish a covenant of circumcision with thee, and it shall be my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations; that thou mayest know forever that children are not accountable before me until they are eight years old. ^verse-11

**12**  And thou shalt observe to keep all my covenants wherein I covenanted with thy fathers; and thou shalt keep the commandments which I have given thee with mine own mouth, and I will be a God unto thee and thy seed after thee. ^verse-12

**23**  Then Abraham fell on his face and rejoiced, and said in his heart, There shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old, and Sarah that is ninety years old shall bear. ^verse-23

**24**  And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live uprightly before thee! ^verse-24
