**14**  And suffer us not to be led into temptation, but deliver us from evil. ^verse-14

**22**  The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single to the glory of God, thy whole body shall be full of light. ^verse-22

**25**  And, again, I say unto you, Go ye into the world, and care not for the world; for the world will hate you, and will persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues. ^verse-25

**26**  Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching the people; and I will go before you. ^verse-26

**27**  And your heavenly Father will provide for you, whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat; and for raiment, what ye shall wear or put on. ^verse-27

**38**  Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. ^verse-38
