**18**  Then said the Pharisees unto him, Why will ye not receive us with our baptism, seeing we keep the whole law? ^verse-18

**20**  I receive not you with your baptism, because it profiteth you nothing. ^verse-20

**21**  For when that which is new is come, the old is ready to be put away. ^verse-21
