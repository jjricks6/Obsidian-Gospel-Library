**13**  But the days will come, when the violent shall have no power; for all the prophets and the law prophesied that it should be thus until John. ^verse-13

**14**  Yea, as many as have prophesied have foretold of these days. ^verse-14

**15**  And if ye will receive it, verily, he was the Elias, who was for to come and prepare all things. ^verse-15
