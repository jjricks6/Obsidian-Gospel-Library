**25**  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. ^verse-25

**26**  And now for a man to take up his cross, is to deny himself all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and keep my commandments. ^verse-26

**27**  Break not my commandments for to save your lives; for whosoever will save his life in this world, shall lose it in the world to come. ^verse-27

**28**  And whosoever will lose his life in this world, for my sake, shall find it in the world to come. ^verse-28

**29**  Therefore, forsake the world, and save your souls; for what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? ^verse-29
