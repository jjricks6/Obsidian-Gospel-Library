**19**  For I will send my servant unto you who are blind; yea, a messenger to open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf; ^verse-19

**20**  And they shall be made perfect notwithstanding their blindness, if they will hearken unto the messenger, the Lord's servant. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou art a people, seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears to hear, but thou hearest not. ^verse-21

**22**  The Lord is not well pleased with such a people, but for his righteousness' sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable. ^verse-22

**23**  Thou art a people robbed and spoiled; thine enemies, all of them, have snared thee in holes, and they have hid thee in prison houses; they have taken thee for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. ^verse-23
