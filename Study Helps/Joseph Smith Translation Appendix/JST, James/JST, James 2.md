**1**  My brethren, ye cannot have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, and yet have respect to persons. ^verse-1

**14**  What profit is it, my brethren, for a man to say he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him? ^verse-14

**15**  Yea, a man may say, I will show thee I have faith without works; but I say, Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. ^verse-15

**16**  For if a brother or sister be naked and destitute, and one of you say, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; notwithstanding he give not those things which are needful to the body; what profit is your faith unto such? ^verse-16

**17**  Even so faith, if it have not works is dead, being alone. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead and cannot save you? ^verse-18

**19**  Thou believest there is one God; thou doest well; the devils also believe, and tremble; thou hast made thyself like unto them, not being justified. ^verse-19

**20**  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? ^verse-20

**21**  Seest thou how works wrought with his faith, and by works was faith made perfect? ^verse-21
