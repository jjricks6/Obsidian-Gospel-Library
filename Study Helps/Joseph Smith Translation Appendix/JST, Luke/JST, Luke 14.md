**35**  Then certain of them came to him, saying, Good Master, we have Moses and the prophets, and whosoever shall live by them, shall he not have life? ^verse-35

**36**  And Jesus answered, saying, Ye know not Moses, neither the prophets; for if ye had known them, ye would have believed on me; for to this intent they were written. For I am sent that ye might have life. Therefore I will liken it unto salt which is good; ^verse-36

**37**  But if the salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? ^verse-37
