**38**  This he spake, signifying the gathering of his saints; and of angels descending and gathering the remainder unto them; the one from the bed, the other from the grinding, and the other from the field, whithersoever he listeth. ^verse-38

**39**  For verily there shall be new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. ^verse-39

**40**  And there shall be no unclean thing; for the earth becoming old, even as a garment, having waxed in corruption, wherefore it vanisheth away, and the footstool remaineth sanctified, cleansed from all sin. ^verse-40
