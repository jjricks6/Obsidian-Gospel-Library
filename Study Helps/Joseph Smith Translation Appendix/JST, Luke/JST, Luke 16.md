**16**  And they said unto him, We have the law, and the prophets; but as for this man we will not receive him to be our ruler; for he maketh himself to be a judge over us. ^verse-16

**17**  Then said Jesus unto them, The law and the prophets testify of me; yea, and all the prophets who have written, even until John, have foretold of these days. ^verse-17

**18**  Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached, and every man who seeketh truth presseth into it. ^verse-18

**19**  And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of the law to fail. ^verse-19

**20**  And why teach ye the law, and deny that which is written; and condemn him whom the Father hath sent to fulfill the law, that ye might all be redeemed? ^verse-20

**21**  O fools! for you have said in your hearts, There is no God. And you pervert the right way; and the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence of you; and you persecute the meek; and in your violence you seek to destroy the kingdom; and ye take the children of the kingdom by force. Woe unto you, ye adulterers! ^verse-21

**22**  And they reviled him again, being angry for the saying, that they were adulterers. ^verse-22

**23**  But he continued, saying, Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her who is put away from her husband, committeth adultery. Verily I say unto you, I will liken you unto the rich man. ^verse-23
