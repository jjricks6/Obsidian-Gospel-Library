**1**  When therefore the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, ^verse-1

**2**  They sought more diligently some means that they might put him to death; for many received John as a prophet, but they believed not on Jesus. ^verse-2

**3**  Now the Lord knew this, though he himself baptized not so many as his disciples; ^verse-3

**4**  For he suffered them for an example, preferring one another. ^verse-4

**26**  For unto such hath God promised his Spirit. And they who worship him, must worship in spirit and in truth. ^verse-26
