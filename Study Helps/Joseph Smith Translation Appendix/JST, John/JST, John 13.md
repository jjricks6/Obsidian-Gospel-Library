**8**    Peter saith unto him, Thou needest not to wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. ^verse-8

**9**  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. ^verse-9

**10**  Jesus saith to him, He that has washed his hands and his head, needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit; and ye are clean, but not all. Now this was the custom of the Jews under their law; wherefore, Jesus did this that the law might be fulfilled. ^verse-10
