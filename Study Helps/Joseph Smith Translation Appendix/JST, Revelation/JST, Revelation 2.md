**22**  Behold, I will cast her into hell, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. ^verse-22

**26**  And to him who overcometh, and keepeth my commandments unto the end, will I give power over many kingdoms; ^verse-26

**27**  And he shall rule them with the word of God; and they shall be in his hands as the vessels of clay in the hands of a potter; and he shall govern them by faith, with equity and justice, even as I received of my Father. ^verse-27
