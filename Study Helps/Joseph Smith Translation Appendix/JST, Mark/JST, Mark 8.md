**37**  For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; or whosoever will save his life, shall be willing to lay it down for my sake; and if he is not willing to lay it down for my sake, he shall lose it. ^verse-37

**38**  But whosoever shall be willing to lose his life for my sake, and the gospel, the same shall save it. ^verse-38
