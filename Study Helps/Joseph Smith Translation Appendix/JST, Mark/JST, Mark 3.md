**21**  And then came certain men unto him, accusing him, saying, Why do ye receive sinners, seeing thou makest thyself the Son of God. ^verse-21

**22**  But he answered them and said, Verily I say unto you, All sins which men have committed, when they repent, shall be forgiven them; for I came to preach repentance unto the sons of men. ^verse-22

**23**  And blasphemies, wherewith soever they shall blaspheme, shall be forgiven them that come unto me, and do the works which they see me do. ^verse-23

**24**  But there is a sin which shall not be forgiven. He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness; but is in danger of being cut down out of the world. And they shall inherit eternal damnation. ^verse-24

**25**  And this he said unto them because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. ^verse-25
