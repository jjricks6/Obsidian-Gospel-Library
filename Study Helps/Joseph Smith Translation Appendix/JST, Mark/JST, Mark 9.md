**47**  It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God, with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. ^verse-47

**48**  For it is better that thyself should be saved, than to be cast into hell with thy brother, where their worm dieth not, and where the fire is not quenched. ^verse-48
