**10**  Full well is it written of you, by the prophets whom ye have rejected. ^verse-10

**11**  They testified these things of a truth, and their blood shall be upon you. ^verse-11

**12**  Ye have kept not the ordinances of God; for Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death of the transgressor, as it is written in your law; but ye keep not the law. ^verse-12
