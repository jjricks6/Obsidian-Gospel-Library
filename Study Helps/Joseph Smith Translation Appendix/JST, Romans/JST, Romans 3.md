**5**  But if we remain in our unrighteousness and commend the righteousness of God, how dare we say, God is unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man who fears God,) ^verse-5

**6**  God forbid; for then how shall God judge the world? ^verse-6

**7**  For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, (as it is called of the Jews,) unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? and not received? Because we are slanderously reported; ^verse-7

**8**  And some affirm that we say, (whose damnation is just,) Let us do evil that good may come. But this is false. ^verse-8
