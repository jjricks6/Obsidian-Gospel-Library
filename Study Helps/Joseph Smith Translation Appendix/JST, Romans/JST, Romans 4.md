**2**  For if Abraham were justified by the law of works, he hath to glory in himself; but not of God. ^verse-2

**3**  For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. ^verse-3

**4**  Now to him who is justified by the law of works, is the reward reckoned, not of grace, but of debt. ^verse-4

**5**  But to him that seeketh not to be justified by the law of works, but believeth on him who justifieth not the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. ^verse-5

**16**  Therefore ye are justified of faith and works, through grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to them only who are of the law, but to them also who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, ^verse-16
