*Hannah prays for a son and vows to give him to the Lord—Eli the priest blesses her—Samuel is born—Hannah loans him to the Lord.*

**1**  Now there was a certain man of [[#^note-1a|Ramathaim-zophim]], of mount Ephraim, and his name was [[#^note-1b|Elkanah]], the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: ^verse-1

**2**  And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had [[#^note-2a|no children]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And this man went up out of his city [[#^note-3a|yearly]] to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in [[#^note-3b|Shiloh]]. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: ^verse-4

**5**  But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb. ^verse-5

**6**  And her adversary also [[#^note-6a|provoked]] her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb. ^verse-6

**7**  And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the [[#^note-7a|house]] of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. ^verse-7

**8**  Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a [[#^note-9a|seat]] by a post of the temple of the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  And she was in [[#^note-10a|bitterness]] of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. ^verse-10

**11**  And she [[#^note-11a|vowed]] a [[#^note-11b|vow]], and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine [[#^note-11c|handmaid]], and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no [[#^note-11d|razor]] come upon his head. ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli [[#^note-12a|marked]] her mouth. ^verse-12

**13**  Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. ^verse-13

**14**  And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. ^verse-14

**15**  And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have [[#^note-15a|poured]] out my soul before the Lord. ^verse-15

**16**  Count not thine handmaid for a [[#^note-16a|daughter]] of [[#^note-16b|Belial]]: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. ^verse-16

**17**  Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. ^verse-17

**18**  And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to [[#^note-19a|Ramah]]: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord [[#^note-19b|remembered]] her. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a [[#^note-20a|son]], and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord the [[#^note-21a|yearly]] sacrifice, and his vow. ^verse-21

**22**  But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever. ^verse-22

**23**  And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young. ^verse-24

**25**  And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. ^verse-25

**26**  And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. ^verse-26

**27**  For this [[#^note-27a|child]] I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: ^verse-27

**28**  Therefore also I have [[#^note-28a|lent]] him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there. ^verse-28
