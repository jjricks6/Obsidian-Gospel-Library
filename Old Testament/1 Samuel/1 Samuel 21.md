*David gets help from Ahimelech the priest—He eats the shewbread—He goes to Gath, where he pretends madness.*

**1**  Then came David to [[#^note-1a|Nob]] to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee? ^verse-1

**2**  And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place. ^verse-2

**3**  Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present. ^verse-3

**4**  And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is [[#^note-4a|hallowed]] [[#^note-4b|bread]]; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women. ^verse-4

**5**  And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel. ^verse-5

**6**  So the priest gave him [[#^note-6a|hallowed]] bread: for there was no bread there but the [[#^note-6b|shewbread]], that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. ^verse-6

**7**  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was [[#^note-7a|Doeg]], an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste. ^verse-8

**9**  And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. ^verse-10

**11**  And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not [[#^note-11a|sing]] one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? ^verse-11

**12**  And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. ^verse-12

**13**  And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his [[#^note-13a|spittle]] fall down upon his beard. ^verse-13

**14**  Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me? ^verse-14

**15**  Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house? ^verse-15
