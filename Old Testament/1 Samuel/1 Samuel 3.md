*The Lord calls Samuel—The house of Eli will not be purged by sacrifices and offerings—Samuel is recognized as a prophet by all Israel—The Lord appears to him.*

**1**  And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open [[#^note-1a|vision]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his [[#^note-2a|eyes]] began to wax dim, that he could not see; ^verse-2

**3**  And ere the [[#^note-3a|lamp]] of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; ^verse-3

**4**  That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. ^verse-4

**5**  And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. ^verse-6

**7**  Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him. ^verse-7

**8**  And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child. ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. ^verse-9

**10**  And the Lord came, and [[#^note-10a|stood]], and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy [[#^note-10b|servant]] heareth. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall [[#^note-11a|tingle]]. ^verse-11

**12**  In that day I will perform [[#^note-12a|against]] Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. ^verse-12

**13**  For I have told him that I will [[#^note-13a|judge]] his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his [[#^note-13b|sons]] made themselves vile, and he [[#^note-13c|restrained]] them not. ^verse-13

**14**  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel [[#^note-15a|feared]] to shew Eli the vision. ^verse-15

**16**  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. ^verse-16

**17**  And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. ^verse-17

**18**  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And Samuel [[#^note-19a|grew]], and the [[#^note-19b|Lord]] was [[#^note-19c|with]] him, and did let none of his words [[#^note-19d|fall]] to the ground. ^verse-19

**20**  And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was [[#^note-20a|established]] to be a prophet of the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord [[#^note-21a|appeared]] again in [[#^note-21b|Shiloh]]: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the [[#^note-21c|word]] of the Lord. ^verse-21
