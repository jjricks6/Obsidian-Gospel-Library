*Hannah sings praises to the Lord—Samuel ministers before the Lord—Eli blesses Elkanah and Hannah, and they have sons and daughters—The sons of Eli reject the Lord and live in wickedness—The Lord rejects the house of Eli.*

**1**  And Hannah [[#^note-1a|prayed]], and said, My heart [[#^note-1b|rejoiceth]] in the Lord, mine [[#^note-1c|horn]] is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy [[#^note-1d|salvation]]. ^verse-1

**2**  There is [[#^note-2a|none]] holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any [[#^note-2b|rock]] like our God. ^verse-2

**3**  Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of [[#^note-3a|knowledge]], and by him [[#^note-3b|actions]] are weighed. ^verse-3

**4**  The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. ^verse-4

**5**  They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the [[#^note-5a|barren]] hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. ^verse-5

**6**  The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he [[#^note-6a|bringeth]] down to the grave, and bringeth up. ^verse-6

**7**  The Lord [[#^note-7a|maketh]] [[#^note-7b|poor]], and maketh [[#^note-7c|rich]]: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. ^verse-7

**8**  He [[#^note-8a|raiseth]] up the [[#^note-8b|poor]] out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the [[#^note-8c|pillars]] of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them. ^verse-8

**9**  He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be [[#^note-9a|silent]] in darkness; for by [[#^note-9b|strength]] shall no man prevail. ^verse-9

**10**  The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall [[#^note-10a|judge]] the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his [[#^note-10b|anointed]]. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|And]] Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Now the [[#^note-12a|sons]] of Eli were [[#^note-12b|sons]] of [[#^note-12c|Belial]]; they knew not the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was [[#^note-13a|in seething]], with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; ^verse-13

**14**  And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest [[#^note-14a|took]] for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. ^verse-14

**15**  Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have [[#^note-15a|sodden]] flesh of thee, but raw. ^verse-15

**16**  And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat [[#^note-16a|presently]], and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men [[#^note-17a|abhorred]] the offering of the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen [[#^note-18a|ephod]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Moreover his [[#^note-19a|mother]] made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And Eli [[#^note-20a|blessed]] Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee seed of this woman for [[#^note-20b|the loan]] which is [[#^note-20c|lent]] to the Lord. And they went unto their own home. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord [[#^note-21a|visited]] Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^verse-22

**23**  And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. ^verse-23

**24**  Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the Lord's people to [[#^note-24a|transgress]]. ^verse-24

**25**  If one man sin against another, the [[#^note-25a|judge]] shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them. ^verse-25

**26**  And the child Samuel [[#^note-26a|grew]] on, and was in [[#^note-26b|favour]] both with the Lord, and also with men. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? ^verse-27

**28**  And did I [[#^note-28a|choose]] him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an [[#^note-28b|ephod]] before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the [[#^note-28c|offerings]] made by fire of the children of Israel? ^verse-28

**29**  Wherefore [[#^note-29a|kick ye at]] my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and [[#^note-29b|honourest]] thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? ^verse-29

**30**  Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy [[#^note-30a|house]], and the house of thy father, should [[#^note-30b|walk]] before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that [[#^note-30c|honour]] me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly [[#^note-30d|esteemed]]. ^verse-30

**31**  Behold, the [[#^note-31a|days]] come, that I will [[#^note-31b|cut off]] thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. ^verse-31

**32**  And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. ^verse-32

**33**  And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. ^verse-33

**34**  And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall [[#^note-34a|die]] both of them. ^verse-34

**35**  And I will [[#^note-35a|raise]] me up a faithful [[#^note-35b|priest]], that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and [[#^note-35c|I]] will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. ^verse-35

**36**  And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. ^verse-36
