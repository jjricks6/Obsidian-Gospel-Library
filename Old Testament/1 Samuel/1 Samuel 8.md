[[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/1 Samuel/1 Samuel 9|Next Entry]]

*Samuel's sons take bribes and pervert judgment—The Israelites seek for a king to rule over them—Samuel rehearses the nature and evils of kingly rule—The Lord consents to give them a king.*

**1**  And it came to pass, when [[#^note-1a|Samuel]] was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. ^verse-1

**2**  Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. ^verse-2

**3**  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took [[#^note-3a|bribes]], and perverted judgment. ^verse-3

**4**  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, ^verse-4

**5**  And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons [[#^note-5a|walk]] not in thy ways: now make us a [[#^note-5b|king]] to judge us like all the nations. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the [[#^note-7a|voice]] of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not [[#^note-7b|rejected]] thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not [[#^note-7c|reign]] over them. ^verse-7

**8**  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet [[#^note-9a|protest]] solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the [[#^note-9b|king]] that shall [[#^note-9c|reign]] over them. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. ^verse-10

**11**  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. ^verse-11

**12**  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to [[#^note-12a|ear]] his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. ^verse-12

**13**  And he will take your daughters to be [[#^note-13a|confectionaries]], and to be cooks, and to be bakers. ^verse-13

**14**  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. ^verse-14

**15**  And he will take the [[#^note-15a|tenth]] of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. ^verse-15

**16**  And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. ^verse-16

**17**  He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. ^verse-17

**18**  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your [[#^note-18a|king]] which ye shall have [[#^note-18b|chosen]] you; and the Lord will not [[#^note-18c|hear]] you in that day. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ Nevertheless the people refused to [[#^note-19a|obey]] the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; ^verse-19

**20**  That we also may be like all the [[#^note-20a|nations]]; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. ^verse-20

**21**  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. ^verse-21

**22**  And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. ^verse-22
