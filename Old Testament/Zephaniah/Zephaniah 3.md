[[Old Testament/Zephaniah/Zephaniah 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Haggai|Next Entry]]

*At the Second Coming, all nations will assemble to battle—Men will have a pure language—The Lord will reign in their midst.*

**1**  Woe to her that is [[#^note-1a|filthy]] and polluted, to the oppressing city! ^verse-1

**2**  She [[#^note-2a|obeyed not]] the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God. ^verse-2

**3**  Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening [[#^note-3a|wolves]]; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. ^verse-3

**4**  Her prophets are [[#^note-4a|light]] and treacherous persons: her priests have [[#^note-4b|polluted]] the sanctuary, they have done violence to the [[#^note-4c|law]]. ^verse-4

**5**  The just Lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. ^verse-5

**6**  I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. ^verse-6

**7**  I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up [[#^note-8a|to]] the prey: for my determination is to gather the [[#^note-8b|nations]], that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the [[#^note-8c|earth]] shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. ^verse-8

**9**  For then will I turn to the people a pure [[#^note-9a|language]], that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one [[#^note-9b|consent]]. ^verse-9

**10**  From [[#^note-10a|beyond]] the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. ^verse-10

**11**  In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be [[#^note-11a|haughty]] [[#^note-11b|because of]] my holy mountain. ^verse-11

**12**  I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak [[#^note-13a|lies]]; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. ^verse-14

**15**  The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the [[#^note-15a|midst]] of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. ^verse-15

**16**  In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. ^verse-16

**17**  The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. ^verse-17

**18**  I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. ^verse-18

**19**  Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that [[#^note-19a|halteth]], and [[#^note-19b|gather]] her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. ^verse-19

**20**  At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I [[#^note-20a|gather]] you: for I will make you a name and a [[#^note-20b|praise]] among all people of the earth, when I turn back your [[#^note-20c|captivity]] before your eyes, saith the Lord. ^verse-20
