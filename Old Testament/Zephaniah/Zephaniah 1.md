*The destruction of Judah is symbolic of the Second Comingâ€”It is the day of the Lord's sacrifice, a day of wrath and trouble.*

**1**  The word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of [[#^note-1a|Josiah]] the son of Amon, king of Judah. ^verse-1

**2**  I will utterly [[#^note-2a|consume]] all things from off the land, saith the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the [[#^note-3a|stumblingblocks]] with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  I will also [[#^note-4a|stretch]] out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the [[#^note-4b|Chemarims]] with the priests; ^verse-4

**5**  And them that worship the host of heaven upon the [[#^note-5a|housetops]]; and them that worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by [[#^note-5b|Malcham]]; ^verse-5

**6**  And them that are [[#^note-6a|turned]] back from the Lord; and those that have not sought the Lord, nor inquired for him. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Hold]] thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the [[#^note-7b|day]] of the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange [[#^note-8a|apparel]]. ^verse-8

**9**  In the same day also will I punish all those that leap [[#^note-9a|on]] the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit. ^verse-9

**10**  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish [[#^note-10a|gate]], and an howling from [[#^note-10b|the second]], and a great crashing from the hills. ^verse-10

**11**  Howl, ye inhabitants of [[#^note-11a|Maktesh]], for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off. ^verse-11

**12**  And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are [[#^note-12a|settled]] on their [[#^note-12b|lees]]: that say in their heart, The Lord will [[#^note-12c|not]] do good, neither will he do evil. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also [[#^note-13a|build]] houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall [[#^note-13b|plant]] vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. ^verse-13

**14**  The [[#^note-14a|great day]] of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. ^verse-14

**15**  That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and [[#^note-15a|desolation]], a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, ^verse-15

**16**  A day of the [[#^note-16a|trumpet]] and alarm against the [[#^note-16b|fenced cities]], and against the high towers. ^verse-16

**17**  And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. ^verse-17

**18**  Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the [[#^note-18a|fire]] of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land. ^verse-18
