*The Jews despise the Lord by offering polluted bread upon the altar and by sacrificing animals with blemishes—The Lord's name will be great among the Gentiles.*

**1**  The burden of the [[#^note-1a|word]] of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. ^verse-1

**2**  I have [[#^note-2a|loved]] you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou [[#^note-2b|loved]] us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, ^verse-2

**3**  And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his [[#^note-3a|heritage]] [[#^note-3b|waste]] for the [[#^note-3c|dragons]] of the wilderness. ^verse-3

**4**  Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever. ^verse-4

**5**  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ A son [[#^note-6a|honoureth]] his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine [[#^note-6b|honour]]? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? ^verse-6

**7**  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. ^verse-7

**8**  And if ye offer the [[#^note-8a|blind]] for [[#^note-8b|sacrifice]], is it not evil? and if ye offer [[#^note-8c|the lame and sick]], is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-8

**9**  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-9

**10**  Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I [[#^note-10a|accept]] an offering at your hand. ^verse-10

**11**  For from the [[#^note-11a|rising]] of the sun even unto the going down of the same my [[#^note-11b|name]] shall be great among the [[#^note-11c|Gentiles]]; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The [[#^note-12a|table]] of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. ^verse-12

**13**  Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have [[#^note-13a|snuffed at it]], saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the [[#^note-13b|lame]], and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I [[#^note-13c|accept]] this of your hand? saith the Lord. ^verse-13

**14**  But [[#^note-14a|cursed]] be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is [[#^note-14b|dreadful]] among the heathen. ^verse-14
