[[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Malachi/Malachi 4|Next Entry]]

*The Lord's messenger will prepare the way for the Second Coming—The Lord will sit in judgment—The people of Israel are commanded to pay tithes and offerings—They keep a book of remembrance.*

**1**  Behold, I will [[#^note-1a|send]] my [[#^note-1b|messenger]], and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly [[#^note-1c|come]] to his [[#^note-1d|temple]], even the [[#^note-1e|messenger]] of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-1

**2**  But who may [[#^note-2a|abide]] the [[#^note-2b|day]] of his [[#^note-2c|coming]]? and who shall [[#^note-2d|stand]] when he appeareth? for he is like a [[#^note-2e|refiner's]] [[#^note-2f|fire]], and like fullers' [[#^note-2g|soap]]: ^verse-2

**3**  And he shall sit as a [[#^note-3a|refiner]] and purifier of silver: and he shall [[#^note-3b|purify]] the [[#^note-3c|sons]] of [[#^note-3d|Levi]], and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an [[#^note-3e|offering]] in righteousness. ^verse-3

**4**  Then shall the offering of [[#^note-4a|Judah]] and Jerusalem be [[#^note-4b|pleasant]] unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. ^verse-4

**5**  And I will come near to you to [[#^note-5a|judgment]]; and I will be a swift witness against the [[#^note-5b|sorcerers]], and against the [[#^note-5c|adulterers]], and against [[#^note-5d|false]] swearers, and against those that [[#^note-5e|oppress]] the hireling in his [[#^note-5f|wages]], the [[#^note-5g|widow]], and the fatherless, and that turn aside the [[#^note-5h|stranger]] from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-5

**6**  For I am the Lord, I [[#^note-6a|change not]]; therefore ye sons of [[#^note-6b|Jacob]] are not [[#^note-6c|consumed]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Even from the days of your [[#^note-7a|fathers]] ye are gone away from mine [[#^note-7b|ordinances]], and have not kept them. [[#^note-7c|Return]] unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? ^verse-7

**8**    ¶ [[#^note-8a|Will]] a man [[#^note-8b|rob]] God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In [[#^note-8c|tithes]] and offerings. ^verse-8

**9**  Ye are [[#^note-9a|cursed]] with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. ^verse-9

**10**  Bring ye all the [[#^note-10a|tithes]] into the storehouse, that there may be [[#^note-10b|meat]] in mine house, and [[#^note-10c|prove]] me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not [[#^note-10d|open]] you the [[#^note-10e|windows of heaven]], and pour you out a [[#^note-10f|blessing]], that there shall not be room enough to receive it. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will [[#^note-11a|rebuke]] the [[#^note-11b|devourer]] for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-11

**12**  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Your words have been [[#^note-13a|stout]] against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? ^verse-13

**14**  Ye have said, It is [[#^note-14a|vain]] to serve God: and what [[#^note-14b|profit]] is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? ^verse-14

**15**  And now we call the [[#^note-15a|proud]] happy; yea, they that work [[#^note-15b|wickedness]] are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a [[#^note-16a|book]] of [[#^note-16b|remembrance]] was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. ^verse-16

**17**  And they shall be [[#^note-17a|mine]], saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my [[#^note-17b|jewels]]; and I will [[#^note-17c|spare]] them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. ^verse-17

**18**  Then shall ye return, and [[#^note-18a|discern]] between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. ^verse-18
