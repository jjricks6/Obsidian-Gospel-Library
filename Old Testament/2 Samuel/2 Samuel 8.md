*David defeats and subjects many nations—The Lord is with him—He executes judgment and justice unto all his people.*

**1**  And after this it came to pass, that David [[#^note-1a|smote]] the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines. ^verse-1

**2**  And he smote [[#^note-2a|Moab]], and [[#^note-2b|measured]] them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the [[#^note-2c|Moabites]] became David's servants, and brought gifts. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. ^verse-3

**4**  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. ^verse-4

**5**  And when the [[#^note-5a|Syrians]] of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. ^verse-5

**6**  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. ^verse-6

**7**  And David took the [[#^note-7a|shields]] of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. ^verse-7

**8**  And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, ^verse-9

**10**  Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: ^verse-10

**11**  Which also king David did [[#^note-11a|dedicate]] unto the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; ^verse-11

**12**  Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of [[#^note-12a|Ammon]], and of the [[#^note-12b|Philistines]], and of [[#^note-12c|Amalek]], and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. ^verse-12

**13**  And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of [[#^note-13a|salt]], being eighteen thousand men. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And he put garrisons in [[#^note-14a|Edom]]; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. ^verse-14

**15**  And David [[#^note-15a|reigned]] over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. ^verse-15

**16**  And [[#^note-16a|Joab]] the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; ^verse-16

**17**  And [[#^note-17a|Zadok]] the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the [[#^note-17b|scribe]]; ^verse-17

**18**  And [[#^note-18a|Benaiah]] the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the [[#^note-18b|Pelethites]]; and David's sons were [[#^note-18c|chief rulers]]. ^verse-18
