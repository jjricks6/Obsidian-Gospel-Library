*David offers to build a house for the Lord—The Lord, through Nathan, says He has not asked David to do so—The Lord will establish David's house and kingdom forever—David offers a prayer of thanksgiving.*

**1**  And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him [[#^note-1a|rest]] round about from all his enemies; ^verse-1

**2**  That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within [[#^note-2a|curtains]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine [[#^note-3a|heart]]; for the Lord is with thee. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto [[#^note-4a|Nathan]], saying, ^verse-4

**5**  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me an [[#^note-5a|house]] for me to dwell in? ^verse-5

**6**  Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. ^verse-6

**7**  In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an [[#^note-7a|house]] of cedar? ^verse-7

**8**  Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the [[#^note-8a|sheepcote]], from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: ^verse-8

**9**  And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, ^verse-10

**11**  And as since the time that I commanded [[#^note-11a|judges]] to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to [[#^note-11b|rest]] from all thine enemies. Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an [[#^note-11c|house]]. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy [[#^note-12a|seed]] after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. ^verse-12

**13**  He shall [[#^note-13a|build]] an house for my name, and I will [[#^note-13b|stablish]] the throne of his kingdom for ever. ^verse-13

**14**  I will be his [[#^note-14a|father]], and he shall be my [[#^note-14b|son]]. If he commit iniquity, I will [[#^note-14c|chasten]] him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: ^verse-14

**15**  But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. ^verse-15

**16**  And thine [[#^note-16a|house]] and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy [[#^note-16b|throne]] shall be established for ever. ^verse-16

**17**  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? ^verse-18

**19**  And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord God? ^verse-19

**20**  And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord God, [[#^note-20a|knowest]] thy servant. ^verse-20

**21**  For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these [[#^note-21a|great things]], to make thy servant know them. ^verse-21

**22**  Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none [[#^note-22a|like]] thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. ^verse-22

**23**  And what one [[#^note-23a|nation]] in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? ^verse-23

**24**  For thou hast [[#^note-24a|confirmed]] to thyself thy people [[#^note-24b|Israel]] to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord, art become their God. ^verse-24

**25**  And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, [[#^note-25a|establish]] it for ever, and do as thou hast said. ^verse-25

**26**  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. ^verse-26

**27**  For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. ^verse-27

**28**  And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be [[#^note-28a|true]], and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: ^verse-28

**29**  Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. ^verse-29
