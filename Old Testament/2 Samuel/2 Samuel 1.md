*David learns of the death of Saul and Jonathan—He slays the Amalekite who claims to have killed Saul—David laments the passing of Saul and Jonathan with a song.*

**1**  Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; ^verse-1

**2**  It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. ^verse-2

**3**  And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. ^verse-3

**4**  And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. ^verse-4

**5**  And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? ^verse-5

**6**  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. ^verse-6

**7**  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. ^verse-7

**8**  And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. ^verse-8

**9**  He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. ^verse-9

**10**  So I stood upon him, and [[#^note-10a|slew]] him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. ^verse-10

**11**  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: ^verse-11

**12**  And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. ^verse-13

**14**  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to [[#^note-14a|destroy]] the Lord's [[#^note-14b|anointed]]? ^verse-14

**15**  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. ^verse-15

**16**  And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: ^verse-17

**18**  (Also he bade them [[#^note-18a|teach]] the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of [[#^note-18b|Jasher]].) ^verse-18

**19**  The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! ^verse-19

**20**  Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. ^verse-20

**21**  Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. ^verse-21

**22**  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. ^verse-22

**23**  Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not [[#^note-23a|divided]]: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. ^verse-23

**24**  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your [[#^note-24a|apparel]]. ^verse-24

**25**  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. ^verse-25

**26**  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy [[#^note-26a|love]] to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. ^verse-26

**27**  How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of [[#^note-27a|war]] perished! ^verse-27
