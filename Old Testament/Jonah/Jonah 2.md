*Jonah prays to the Lord, and the fish vomits him out on dry ground.*

**1**  Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly, ^verse-1

**2**  And said, I cried by reason of mine [[#^note-2a|affliction]] unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of [[#^note-2b|hell]] cried I, and thou heardest my voice. ^verse-2

**3**  For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. ^verse-3

**4**  Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy [[#^note-4a|temple]]. ^verse-4

**5**  The waters compassed me about, [[#^note-5a|even to the soul]]: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. ^verse-5

**6**  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou [[#^note-6a|brought up]] my life from corruption, O Lord my God. ^verse-6

**7**  When my soul fainted within me I [[#^note-7a|remembered]] the Lord: and my [[#^note-7b|prayer]] came in unto thee, into thine holy [[#^note-7c|temple]]. ^verse-7

**8**  They that observe [[#^note-8a|lying]] vanities forsake their own mercy. ^verse-8

**9**  But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have [[#^note-9a|vowed]]. [[#^note-9b|Salvation]] is of the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  Â¶ And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. ^verse-10
