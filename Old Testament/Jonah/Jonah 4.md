*Jonah is displeased with the Lord for His mercy upon the people—The Lord rebukes him.*

**1**  But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. ^verse-1

**2**  And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and [[#^note-2a|merciful]], slow to anger, and of great kindness, and [[#^note-2b|repentest]] thee of the evil. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Then said the Lord, Doest thou well to be angry? ^verse-4

**5**  So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a [[#^note-5a|booth]], and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord God prepared a [[#^note-6a|gourd]], and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. ^verse-6

**7**  But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement [[#^note-8a|east wind]]; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. ^verse-8

**9**  And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be [[#^note-9a|angry]] for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. ^verse-9

**10**  Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: ^verse-10

**11**  And should not I [[#^note-11a|spare]] Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand [[#^note-11b|persons]] that cannot [[#^note-11c|discern]] between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? ^verse-11
