*Babylon will be destroyed and never rise again—The scattered people of Israel will be brought again into the lands of their inheritance.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|word]] that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. ^verse-1

**2**  Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, [[#^note-2a|Bel]] is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. ^verse-2

**3**  For out of the [[#^note-3a|north]] there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall [[#^note-3b|dwell]] therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall [[#^note-4a|come]], they and the children of Judah [[#^note-4b|together]], going and [[#^note-4c|weeping]]: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. ^verse-4

**5**  They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a [[#^note-5a|perpetual]] [[#^note-5b|covenant]] that shall not be forgotten. ^verse-5

**6**  My people hath been lost sheep: their [[#^note-6a|shepherds]] have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. ^verse-6

**7**  All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We [[#^note-7a|offend not]], because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Remove]] out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the [[#^note-8b|Chaldeans]], and be as the he goats before the flocks. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the [[#^note-9a|north]] country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their [[#^note-9b|arrows]] shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return [[#^note-9c|in vain]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; ^verse-11

**12**  Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the [[#^note-12a|hindermost]] of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. ^verse-12

**13**  Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. ^verse-13

**14**  Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord. ^verse-14

**15**  Shout against her round about: she hath [[#^note-15a|given her hand]]: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. ^verse-15

**16**  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his [[#^note-16a|people]], and they shall flee every one to his own [[#^note-16b|land]]. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath [[#^note-17a|broken]] his bones. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will [[#^note-19a|bring]] Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. ^verse-19

**20**  In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will [[#^note-20a|pardon]] them whom I reserve. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. ^verse-21

**22**  A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. ^verse-22

**23**  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! ^verse-23

**24**  I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord. ^verse-24

**25**  The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. ^verse-25

**26**  Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. ^verse-26

**27**  Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their [[#^note-27a|visitation]]. ^verse-27

**28**  The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple. ^verse-28

**29**  Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel. ^verse-29

**30**  Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord. ^verse-30

**31**  Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. ^verse-31

**32**  And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. ^verse-33

**34**  Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name: he shall throughly [[#^note-34a|plead]] their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. ^verse-34

**35**  ¶ A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. ^verse-35

**36**  A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. ^verse-36

**37**  A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the [[#^note-37a|mingled]] people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her [[#^note-37b|treasures]]; and they shall be robbed. ^verse-37

**38**  A [[#^note-38a|drought]] is upon her waters; and they shall be [[#^note-38b|dried]] up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. ^verse-38

**39**  Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the [[#^note-39a|owls]] shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. ^verse-39

**40**  As God overthrew [[#^note-40a|Sodom]] and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the Lord; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. ^verse-40

**41**  Behold, a people shall come from the [[#^note-41a|north]], and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the [[#^note-41b|coasts]] of the earth. ^verse-41

**42**  They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are [[#^note-42a|cruel]], and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. ^verse-42

**43**  The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. ^verse-43

**44**  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that [[#^note-44a|shepherd]] that will stand before me? ^verse-44

**45**  Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them. ^verse-45

**46**  At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is [[#^note-46a|moved]], and the cry is heard among the nations. ^verse-46
