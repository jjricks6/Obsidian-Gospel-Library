*The utter ruin of Judah is foreseen—Israel is rejected and scattered for serving false gods—Fishers and hunters will gather Israel again, and the people will serve the Lord—The gospel is to be restored.*

**1**  The word of the Lord came also unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. ^verse-2

**3**  For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land; ^verse-3

**4**  They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be [[#^note-4a|lamented]]; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be [[#^note-4b|consumed]] by the sword, and by famine; and their [[#^note-4c|carcases]] shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. ^verse-4

**5**  For thus saith the Lord, Enter not into the house of [[#^note-5a|mourning]], neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the Lord, even lovingkindness and mercies. ^verse-5

**6**  Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, [[#^note-6a|nor]] cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them: ^verse-6

**7**  Neither shall men [[#^note-7a|tear themselves]] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink. ^verse-8

**9**  For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of [[#^note-9a|mirth]], and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, [[#^note-10a|Wherefore]] hath the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God? ^verse-10

**11**  Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the Lord, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; ^verse-11

**12**  And ye have done [[#^note-12a|worse]] than your [[#^note-12b|fathers]]; for, behold, ye walk every one after the [[#^note-12c|imagination]] of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me: ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore will I [[#^note-13a|cast]] you out of this [[#^note-13b|land]] into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other [[#^note-13c|gods]] day and night; where I will not [[#^note-13d|shew you favour]]. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the [[#^note-14a|Lord]], that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; ^verse-14

**15**  But, The Lord liveth, that [[#^note-15a|brought up]] the children of Israel from the land of the [[#^note-15b|north]], and from all the [[#^note-15c|lands]] whither he had driven them: and I will [[#^note-15d|bring]] them again into their [[#^note-15e|land]] that I gave unto their fathers. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Behold, I will send for many [[#^note-16a|fishers]], saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. ^verse-16

**17**  For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their [[#^note-17a|iniquity]] hid from mine eyes. ^verse-17

**18**  And first I will [[#^note-18a|recompense]] their iniquity and their sin [[#^note-18b|double]]; because they have [[#^note-18c|defiled]] my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things. ^verse-18

**19**  O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the [[#^note-19a|Gentiles]] shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have [[#^note-19b|inherited]] lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. ^verse-19

**20**  Shall a man make [[#^note-20a|gods]] unto himself, and they are no [[#^note-20b|gods]]? ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to [[#^note-21a|know]], I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my [[#^note-21b|name]] is The Lord. ^verse-21
