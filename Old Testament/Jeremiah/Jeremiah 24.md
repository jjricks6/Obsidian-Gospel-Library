*Zedekiah and the people of Judah will be cursed and scattered—Some will be gathered back from Chaldea to serve the Lord.*

**1**  The Lord shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the Lord, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of [[#^note-1a|Jehoiakim]] king of Judah, and the [[#^note-1b|princes]] of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to [[#^note-1c|Babylon]]. ^verse-1

**2**  One basket had very good [[#^note-2a|figs]], even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very [[#^note-2b|naughty]] figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. ^verse-2

**3**  Then said the Lord unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-4

**5**  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Like these [[#^note-5a|good]] figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. ^verse-5

**6**  For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will [[#^note-6a|bring]] them again to this [[#^note-6b|land]]: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will [[#^note-6c|plant]] them, and not pluck them up. ^verse-6

**7**  And I will give them an [[#^note-7a|heart]] to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the Lord, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the [[#^note-8a|residue]] of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: ^verse-8

**9**  And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a [[#^note-9a|reproach]] and a proverb, a taunt and a [[#^note-9b|curse]], in all places whither I shall drive them. ^verse-9

**10**  And I will send the sword, the [[#^note-10a|famine]], and the pestilence, among them, till they be [[#^note-10b|consumed]] from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. ^verse-10
