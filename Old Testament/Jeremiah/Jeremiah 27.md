*The Lord sends word to many nations that they are to serve Babylon—The vessels of the Lord's house will go into Babylon.*

**1**  In the beginning of the reign of [[#^note-1a|Jehoiakim]] the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Thus saith the Lord to me; Make thee bonds and [[#^note-2a|yokes]], and put them upon thy neck, ^verse-2

**3**  And send them to the [[#^note-3a|king]] of [[#^note-3b|Edom]], and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of [[#^note-3c|Zidon]], by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; ^verse-3

**4**  And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; ^verse-4

**5**  I have made the [[#^note-5a|earth]], the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have [[#^note-5b|given]] it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. ^verse-5

**6**  And now have I [[#^note-6a|given]] all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the [[#^note-6b|beasts]] of the field have I given him also to serve him. ^verse-6

**7**  And all [[#^note-7a|nations]] shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall [[#^note-7b|serve themselves of him]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your [[#^note-9a|diviners]], nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your [[#^note-9b|sorcerers]], which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: ^verse-9

**10**  For they prophesy a [[#^note-10a|lie]] unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. ^verse-10

**11**  But the nations that bring their neck under the [[#^note-11a|yoke]] of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall till it, and dwell therein. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of [[#^note-12a|Babylon]], and serve him and his people, and live. ^verse-12

**13**  Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. ^verse-14

**15**  For I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they [[#^note-15a|prophesy]] a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you. ^verse-15

**16**  Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the [[#^note-16a|vessels]] of the Lord's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. ^verse-16

**17**  Hearken not unto them; serve the king of [[#^note-17a|Babylon]], and live: wherefore should this city be laid [[#^note-17b|waste]]? ^verse-17

**18**  But if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them now make [[#^note-18a|intercession]] to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the [[#^note-19a|pillars]], and concerning the [[#^note-19b|sea]], and concerning the [[#^note-19c|bases]], and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, ^verse-19

**20**  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive [[#^note-20a|Jeconiah]] the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; ^verse-20

**21**  Yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; ^verse-21

**22**  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the Lord; then will I [[#^note-22a|bring]] them up, and restore them to this place. ^verse-22
