*Jeremiah prophesies the conquest of Egypt by Babylon—Jacob will be saved and will return to his own land.*

**1**  The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the [[#^note-1a|Gentiles]]; ^verse-1

**2**  Against Egypt, against the army of [[#^note-2a|Pharaoh-necho]] king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. ^verse-2

**3**  Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. ^verse-3

**4**  Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the [[#^note-4a|brigandines]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and [[#^note-5a|turned away back]]? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. ^verse-6

**7**  Who is this that cometh up as a [[#^note-7a|flood]], whose waters are moved as the rivers? ^verse-7

**8**  Egypt riseth up like [[#^note-8a|a flood]], and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. ^verse-8

**9**  Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the [[#^note-9a|Lydians]], that handle and bend the bow. ^verse-9

**10**  For this is the [[#^note-10a|day]] of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be [[#^note-10b|satiate]] and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord God of hosts hath a [[#^note-10c|sacrifice]] in the north country by the river Euphrates. ^verse-10

**11**  Go up into Gilead, and take [[#^note-11a|balm]], O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. ^verse-11

**12**  The nations have heard of thy [[#^note-12a|shame]], and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ The word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of [[#^note-13a|Egypt]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in [[#^note-14a|Migdol]], and publish in Noph and in [[#^note-14b|Tahpanhes]]: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee. ^verse-14

**15**  Why are thy [[#^note-15a|valiant]] men swept away? they stood not, because the Lord did drive them. ^verse-15

**16**  He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. ^verse-16

**17**  They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed. ^verse-17

**18**  As I live, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. ^verse-18

**19**  O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into [[#^note-19a|captivity]]: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant. ^verse-19

**20**  Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. ^verse-20

**21**  Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. ^verse-21

**22**  The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. ^verse-22

**23**  They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable. ^verse-23

**24**  The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. ^verse-24

**25**  The [[#^note-25a|Lord of hosts]], [[#^note-25b|the]] God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of [[#^note-25c|No]], and [[#^note-25d|Pharaoh]], and Egypt, with their [[#^note-25e|gods]], and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him: ^verse-25

**26**  And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be [[#^note-26a|inhabited]], as in the days of old, saith the Lord. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ But fear not thou, O my servant [[#^note-27a|Jacob]], and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. ^verse-27

**28**  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished. ^verse-28
