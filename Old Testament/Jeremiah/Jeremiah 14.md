*Jeremiah prays because of dearth and famine—The Lord will not hear because of the wickedness of His people.*

**1**  The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the [[#^note-1a|dearth]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are [[#^note-2a|black unto the ground]]; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. ^verse-2

**3**  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. ^verse-3

**4**  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no [[#^note-4a|rain]] in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. ^verse-4

**5**  Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. ^verse-5

**6**  And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like [[#^note-6a|dragons]]; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. ^verse-7

**8**  O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? ^verse-8

**9**  Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not [[#^note-10a|refrained]] their feet, therefore the Lord doth not accept them; he will now remember their [[#^note-10b|iniquity]], and visit their sins. ^verse-10

**11**  Then said the Lord unto me, [[#^note-11a|Pray]] not for this people for their good. ^verse-11

**12**  When they fast, I will not [[#^note-12a|hear]] their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will [[#^note-12b|consume]] them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the [[#^note-13a|sword]], neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. ^verse-13

**14**  Then the Lord said unto me, The [[#^note-14a|prophets]] prophesy [[#^note-14b|lies]] in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false [[#^note-14c|vision]] and divination, and a thing of nought, and the [[#^note-14d|deceit]] of their heart. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I [[#^note-15a|sent]] them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be [[#^note-15b|consumed]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to [[#^note-16a|bury]] them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. ^verse-17

**18**  If I go forth into the field, then behold the [[#^note-18a|slain]] with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a [[#^note-18b|land]] that they know not. ^verse-18

**19**  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for [[#^note-19a|peace]], and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! ^verse-19

**20**  We [[#^note-20a|acknowledge]], O Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have [[#^note-20b|sinned]] against thee. ^verse-20

**21**  Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy [[#^note-21a|covenant]] with us. ^verse-21

**22**  Are there any among the [[#^note-22a|vanities of the Gentiles]] that can cause rain? or can the heavens give [[#^note-22b|showers]]? art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast [[#^note-22c|made]] all these things. ^verse-22
