*In the last days, Judah and Israel will be gathered to their own lands—David, their king (the Messiah), will reign over them.*

**1**  The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. ^verse-2

**3**  For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of my people [[#^note-3a|Israel]] and Judah, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to [[#^note-3b|return]] to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. ^verse-4

**5**  For thus saith the Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. ^verse-5

**6**  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? ^verse-6

**7**  Alas! for that [[#^note-7a|day]] is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. ^verse-7

**8**  For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his [[#^note-8a|yoke]] from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more [[#^note-8b|serve themselves of him]]: ^verse-8

**9**  But they shall serve the Lord their God, and [[#^note-9a|David]] their king, whom I will raise up unto them. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will [[#^note-10a|save]] thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. ^verse-10

**11**  For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: though I make a full [[#^note-11a|end]] of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. ^verse-11

**12**  For thus saith the Lord, [[#^note-12a|Thy]] bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. ^verse-12

**13**  There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. ^verse-13

**14**  All thy [[#^note-14a|lovers]] have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have [[#^note-14b|wounded thee]] with the [[#^note-14c|wound]] of an enemy, with the chastisement of a [[#^note-14d|cruel]] one, for the multitude of thine [[#^note-14e|iniquity]]; because thy sins were increased. ^verse-14

**15**  Why criest thou for thine affliction? [[#^note-15a|thy]] [[#^note-15b|sorrow]] is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy [[#^note-15c|sins]] were increased, I have done these things unto thee. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. ^verse-16

**17**  For I will restore [[#^note-17a|health]] unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have [[#^note-18a|mercy]] on his dwellingplaces; and [[#^note-18b|the]] city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. ^verse-18

**19**  And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will [[#^note-19a|multiply]] them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be [[#^note-19b|small]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. ^verse-20

**21**  And their nobles shall be of [[#^note-21a|themselves]], and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to [[#^note-21b|draw near]], and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord. ^verse-21

**22**  And ye shall be my [[#^note-22a|people]], and I will be your God. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold, the [[#^note-23a|whirlwind]] of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with [[#^note-23b|pain]] upon the head of the wicked. ^verse-23

**24**  The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the [[#^note-24a|latter days]] ye shall [[#^note-24b|consider it]]. ^verse-24
