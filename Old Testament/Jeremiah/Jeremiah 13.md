*Israel and Judah will be as a rotted and decayed belt—The people are commanded to repent—Judah will be taken captive and scattered as stubble.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. ^verse-1

**2**  So I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it on my loins. ^verse-2

**3**  And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, ^verse-3

**4**  Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. ^verse-4

**5**  So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. ^verse-5

**6**  And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there. ^verse-6

**7**  Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. ^verse-7

**8**  Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  Thus saith the Lord, After this manner will I mar the [[#^note-9a|pride]] of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. ^verse-9

**10**  This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the [[#^note-10a|imagination]] of their heart, and [[#^note-10b|walk]] after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. ^verse-10

**11**  For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not [[#^note-11a|hear]]. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? ^verse-12

**13**  Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with [[#^note-13a|drunkenness]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the Lord: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but [[#^note-14a|destroy]] them. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Hear ye, and give ear; be not [[#^note-15a|proud]]: for the Lord hath spoken. ^verse-15

**16**  Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause [[#^note-16a|darkness]], and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. ^verse-16

**17**  But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord's [[#^note-17a|flock]] is carried away captive. ^verse-17

**18**  Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. ^verse-18

**19**  The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be [[#^note-19a|carried away]] captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive. ^verse-19

**20**  Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? ^verse-20

**21**  What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail? ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy [[#^note-22a|skirts]] [[#^note-22b|discovered]], and thy heels made bare. ^verse-22

**23**  Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do [[#^note-23a|good]], that are accustomed to do evil. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore will I [[#^note-24a|scatter]] them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. ^verse-24

**25**  This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the Lord; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. ^verse-26

**27**  I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine [[#^note-27a|abominations]] on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made [[#^note-27b|clean]]? when shall it once be? ^verse-27
