*Judgment and destruction will come upon the people of Ammon, Edom, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam.*

**1**  Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the Lord; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in [[#^note-2a|Rabbah]] of the [[#^note-2b|Ammonites]]; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her [[#^note-2c|daughters]] shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into [[#^note-3a|captivity]], and his priests and his princes together. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her [[#^note-4a|treasures]], saying, Who shall come unto me? ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. ^verse-5

**6**  And afterward I will [[#^note-6a|bring again]] the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Concerning [[#^note-7a|Edom]], thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the [[#^note-7b|prudent]]? is their wisdom vanished? ^verse-7

**8**  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. ^verse-8

**9**  If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if [[#^note-9a|thieves]] by night, they will destroy till they have enough. ^verse-9

**10**  But I have made [[#^note-10a|Esau]] bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his [[#^note-10b|seed]] is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. ^verse-10

**11**  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy [[#^note-11a|widows]] trust in me. ^verse-11

**12**  For thus saith the Lord; Behold, they whose judgment was not to [[#^note-12a|drink]] of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. ^verse-12

**13**  For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that [[#^note-13a|Bozrah]] shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the [[#^note-13b|cities]] thereof shall be perpetual wastes. ^verse-13

**14**  I have heard a [[#^note-14a|rumour]] from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent unto the [[#^note-14b|heathen]], saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. ^verse-14

**15**  For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men. ^verse-15

**16**  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the [[#^note-16a|pride]] of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  Also [[#^note-17a|Edom]] shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. ^verse-17

**18**  As in the overthrow of [[#^note-18a|Sodom]] and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the Lord, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. ^verse-18

**19**  Behold, he shall come up like a [[#^note-19a|lion]] from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? ^verse-19

**20**  Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. ^verse-20

**21**  The earth is [[#^note-21a|moved]] at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. ^verse-23

**24**  Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and [[#^note-24a|sorrows]] have taken her, as a woman in travail. ^verse-24

**25**  How is the city of [[#^note-25a|praise]] not [[#^note-25b|left]], the city of my joy! ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-26

**27**  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ Concerning [[#^note-28a|Kedar]], and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the Lord; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. ^verse-28

**29**  Their [[#^note-29a|tents]] and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their [[#^note-29b|curtains]], and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, [[#^note-29c|Fear]] is on every side. ^verse-29

**30**  ¶ Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the Lord; for [[#^note-30a|Nebuchadrezzar]] king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. ^verse-30

**31**  Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the Lord, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. ^verse-31

**32**  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the Lord. ^verse-32

**33**  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for [[#^note-33a|dragons]], and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. ^verse-33

**34**  ¶ The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against [[#^note-34a|Elam]] in the beginning of the reign of [[#^note-34b|Zedekiah]] king of Judah, saying, ^verse-34

**35**  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. ^verse-35

**36**  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four [[#^note-36a|quarters]] of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. ^verse-36

**37**  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring [[#^note-37a|evil]] upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: ^verse-37

**38**  And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the Lord. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the Lord. ^verse-39
