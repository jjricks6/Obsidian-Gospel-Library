*Israel and Judah are called to repentance—Jeremiah laments for the miseries of Judah.*

**1**  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. ^verse-1

**2**  And thou shalt swear, The [[#^note-2a|Lord]] liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, [[#^note-3a|Break]] up your fallow ground, and sow not among [[#^note-3b|thorns]]. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Circumcise]] yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. ^verse-4

**5**  Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. ^verse-5

**6**  Set up the [[#^note-6a|standard]] toward [[#^note-6b|Zion]]: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the [[#^note-6c|north]], and a great destruction. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|lion]] is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy [[#^note-7b|land]] desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. ^verse-7

**8**  For this [[#^note-8a|gird]] you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce [[#^note-8b|anger]] of the Lord is not turned back from us. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. ^verse-9

**10**  Then said I, Ah, Lord God! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. ^verse-10

**11**  At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry [[#^note-11a|wind]] of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, ^verse-11

**12**  Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them. ^verse-12

**13**  Behold, he shall come up as [[#^note-13a|clouds]], and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are [[#^note-13b|swifter]] than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. ^verse-13

**14**  O Jerusalem, [[#^note-14a|wash]] thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? ^verse-14

**15**  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim. ^verse-15

**16**  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. ^verse-16

**17**  As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ My [[#^note-19a|bowels]], my bowels! I am [[#^note-19b|pained]] at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Destruction]] upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my [[#^note-20b|tents]] spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. ^verse-20

**21**  How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? ^verse-21

**22**  For my people is [[#^note-22a|foolish]], they have not [[#^note-22b|known]] me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do [[#^note-22c|evil]], but to do good they have no knowledge. ^verse-22

**23**  I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was [[#^note-23a|without form]], and [[#^note-23b|void]]; and the heavens, and they had no light. ^verse-23

**24**  I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. ^verse-24

**25**  I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. ^verse-25

**26**  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger. ^verse-26

**27**  For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full [[#^note-27a|end]]. ^verse-27

**28**  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not [[#^note-28a|repent]], neither will I turn back from it. ^verse-28

**29**  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be [[#^note-29a|forsaken]], and not a man dwell therein. ^verse-29

**30**  And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with [[#^note-30a|ornaments]] of gold, though thou [[#^note-30b|rentest thy face]] with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy [[#^note-30c|lovers]] will despise thee, they will seek thy life. ^verse-30

**31**  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of [[#^note-31a|Zion]], that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers. ^verse-31
