*The people of Judah will suffer death, the sword, famine, and captivity—They will be scattered into all the kingdoms of the earth—Jerusalem will be destroyed.*

**1**  Then said the Lord unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth. ^verse-1

**2**  And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. ^verse-2

**3**  And I will appoint over them four [[#^note-3a|kinds]], saith the Lord: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to [[#^note-3b|devour]] and destroy. ^verse-3

**4**  And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of [[#^note-4a|Manasseh]] the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. ^verse-4

**5**  For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? ^verse-5

**6**  Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting. ^verse-6

**7**  And I will [[#^note-7a|fan them]] with a fan in the gates of the land; I will [[#^note-7b|bereave]] them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways. ^verse-7

**8**  Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. ^verse-8

**9**  She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ [[#^note-10a|Woe]] is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of [[#^note-10b|strife]] and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on [[#^note-10c|usury]], nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me. ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. ^verse-11

**12**  Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? ^verse-12

**13**  Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a [[#^note-14a|land]] which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ O Lord, thou knowest: remember me, and [[#^note-15a|visit me]], and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have [[#^note-15b|suffered]] [[#^note-15c|rebuke]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Thy words were found, and I did [[#^note-16a|eat]] them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy [[#^note-16b|name]], O Lord God of hosts. ^verse-16

**17**  I sat not in the assembly of the [[#^note-17a|mockers]], nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. ^verse-17

**18**  Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail? ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou [[#^note-19a|return]], then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them. ^verse-19

**20**  And I will make thee unto this people a [[#^note-20a|fenced brasen wall]]: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to [[#^note-20b|save]] thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. ^verse-21
