*Learn not the way of other nations—Their gods are idols and molten images—The Lord is the true and living God.*

**1**  Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: ^verse-1

**2**  Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the [[#^note-2a|heathen]], and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. ^verse-2

**3**  For the [[#^note-3a|customs]] of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. ^verse-3

**4**  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. ^verse-4

**5**  They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be [[#^note-5a|borne]], because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. ^verse-5

**6**  Forasmuch as there is none [[#^note-6a|like]] unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. ^verse-6

**7**  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the [[#^note-7a|wise]] men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none [[#^note-7b|like]] unto thee. ^verse-7

**8**  But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities. ^verse-8

**9**  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the [[#^note-9a|work]] of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of [[#^note-9b|cunning]] men. ^verse-9

**10**  But the Lord is the true [[#^note-10a|God]], he is the [[#^note-10b|living God]], and an everlasting [[#^note-10c|king]]: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his [[#^note-10d|indignation]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Thus shall ye say unto them, The [[#^note-11a|gods]] that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. ^verse-11

**12**  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. ^verse-12

**13**  When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his [[#^note-13a|treasures]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven [[#^note-14a|image]]: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. ^verse-14

**15**  They are vanity, and the work of [[#^note-15a|errors]]: in the time of their [[#^note-15b|visitation]] they shall perish. ^verse-15

**16**  The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. ^verse-17

**18**  For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it. ^verse-19

**20**  My [[#^note-20a|tabernacle]] is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. ^verse-20

**21**  For the [[#^note-21a|pastors]] are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the [[#^note-22a|north]] country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of [[#^note-22b|dragons]]. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ O Lord, I know that the [[#^note-23a|way]] of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. ^verse-23

**24**  O Lord, [[#^note-24a|correct]] me, but with [[#^note-24b|judgment]]; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. ^verse-24

**25**  Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the [[#^note-25a|families]] that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. ^verse-25
