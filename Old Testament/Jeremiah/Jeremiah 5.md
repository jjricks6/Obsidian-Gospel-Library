[[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 6|Next Entry]]

*Judgments will be poured out upon the people of Judah because of their sins—Their iniquities cause blessings to be withheld from them.*

**1**  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that [[#^note-1a|executeth judgment]], that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. ^verse-1

**2**  And though they say, The Lord liveth; surely they [[#^note-2a|swear]] falsely. ^verse-2

**3**  O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to [[#^note-3a|return]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they [[#^note-4a|know not]] the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God. ^verse-4

**5**  I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the [[#^note-5a|yoke]], and burst the bonds. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a [[#^note-6a|wolf]] of the [[#^note-6b|evenings]] shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their [[#^note-6c|transgressions]] are many, and their backslidings are increased. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the [[#^note-7a|full]], they then committed [[#^note-7b|adultery]], and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. ^verse-7

**8**  They were as [[#^note-8a|fed horses]] in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. ^verse-8

**9**  Shall I not [[#^note-9a|visit]] for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be [[#^note-9b|avenged]] on such a nation as this? ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Go ye up upon her walls, and [[#^note-10a|destroy]]; but make not a full [[#^note-10b|end]]: take away her battlements; for they are not the Lord's. ^verse-10

**11**  For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see [[#^note-12a|sword]] nor famine: ^verse-12

**13**  And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy [[#^note-14a|mouth]] fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. ^verse-14

**15**  Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose [[#^note-15a|language]] thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. ^verse-15

**16**  Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. ^verse-16

**17**  And they shall [[#^note-17a|eat]] up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. ^verse-17

**18**  Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full end with you. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have [[#^note-19a|forsaken]] me, and served strange [[#^note-19b|gods]] in your land, so shall ye [[#^note-19c|serve]] [[#^note-19d|strangers]] in a land that is not yours. ^verse-19

**20**  Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, ^verse-20

**21**  Hear now this, O [[#^note-21a|foolish]] people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and [[#^note-21b|see not]]; which have ears, and [[#^note-21c|hear]] not: ^verse-21

**22**  Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? ^verse-22

**23**  But this people hath a revolting and a [[#^note-23a|rebellious]] heart; they are revolted and gone. ^verse-23

**24**  Nei[[#^note-24a|the]]r say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you. ^verse-25

**26**  For among my people are found [[#^note-26a|wicked]] men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they [[#^note-26b|catch]] men. ^verse-26

**27**  As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become [[#^note-27a|great]], and waxen rich. ^verse-27

**28**  They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they [[#^note-28a|judge not]] the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. ^verse-28

**29**  Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? ^verse-29

**30**  ¶ A wonderful and [[#^note-30a|horrible]] thing is committed in the land; ^verse-30

**31**  The [[#^note-31a|prophets]] prophesy [[#^note-31b|falsely]], and the [[#^note-31c|priests]] bear rule by their means; and my people [[#^note-31d|love]] to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? ^verse-31
