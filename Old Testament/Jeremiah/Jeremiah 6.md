### Chapter 6

[[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah 7|Next Entry]]

*Jerusalem will be destroyed because of her iniquity—She will be overrun by a great and cruel nation.*

**1**  O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the [[#^note-1a|north]], and great destruction. ^verse-1

**2**  I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. ^verse-2

**3**  The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. ^verse-3

**4**  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. ^verse-4

**5**  Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ For thus hath the Lord of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a [[#^note-6a|mount]] against Jerusalem: this is the city to be [[#^note-6b|visited]]; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. ^verse-6

**7**  As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her [[#^note-7a|wickedness]]: [[#^note-7b|violence]] and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds. ^verse-7

**8**  Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall [[#^note-9a|throughly]] glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer [[#^note-9b|into the baskets]]. ^verse-9

**10**  To whom shall I speak, and give [[#^note-10a|warning]], that they may hear? behold, their ear is [[#^note-10b|uncircumcised]], and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. ^verse-11

**12**  And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to [[#^note-13a|covetousness]]; and from the prophet even unto the [[#^note-13b|priest]] every one dealeth falsely. ^verse-13

**14**  They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, [[#^note-14a|Peace]], peace; when there is no peace. ^verse-14

**15**  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I [[#^note-15a|visit]] them they shall be cast down, saith the Lord. ^verse-15

**16**  Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old [[#^note-16a|paths]], where is the good way, and [[#^note-16b|walk]] therein, and ye shall find [[#^note-16c|rest]] for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein. ^verse-16

**17**  Also I set [[#^note-17a|watchmen]] over you, saying, [[#^note-17b|Hearken]] to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. ^verse-18

**19**  Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring [[#^note-19a|evil]] upon this people, even the [[#^note-19b|fruit]] of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. ^verse-19

**20**  To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not [[#^note-20a|acceptable]], nor your sacrifices sweet unto me. ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will lay [[#^note-21a|stumblingblocks]] before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish. ^verse-21

**22**  Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people cometh from the [[#^note-22a|north]] country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. ^verse-22

**23**  They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. ^verse-23

**24**  We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail. ^verse-24

**25**  Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ O daughter of my people, gird thee with [[#^note-26a|sackcloth]], and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an [[#^note-26b|only]] son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. ^verse-26

**27**  I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. ^verse-27

**28**  They are all grievous revolters, walking with [[#^note-28a|slanders]]: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters. ^verse-28

**29**  The bellows [[#^note-29a|are burned]], [[#^note-29b|the]] lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. ^verse-29

**30**  Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them. ^verse-30
