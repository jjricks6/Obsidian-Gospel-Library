**1**  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto [[#^note-1a|Baruch]] the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; ^verse-2

**3**  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no [[#^note-3a|rest]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Â¶ Thus shalt thou say unto him, The Lord saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I [[#^note-4a|break]] down, and that which I have planted I will [[#^note-4b|pluck]] up, even [[#^note-4c|this whole land]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And [[#^note-5a|seekest]] thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy [[#^note-5b|life]] will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest. ^verse-5
