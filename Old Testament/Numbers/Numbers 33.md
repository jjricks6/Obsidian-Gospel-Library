*Israel's journeys from Egypt to Canaan are reviewed—The people are commanded to drive out the inhabitants of the land—Any remaining inhabitants will vex Israel.*

**1**  These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. ^verse-1

**3**  And they departed from [[#^note-3a|Rameses]] in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out [[#^note-3b|with]] an [[#^note-3c|high]] hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. ^verse-3

**4**  For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments. ^verse-4

**31**  And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan. ^verse-31

**32**  And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad. ^verse-32

**33**  And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in [[#^note-33a|Jotbathah]]. ^verse-33

**34**  And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah. ^verse-34

**35**  And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber. ^verse-35

**38**  And [[#^note-38a|Aaron]] the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the [[#^note-38b|fortieth]] year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month. ^verse-38

**39**  And [[#^note-39a|Aaron]] was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. ^verse-39

**47**  And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before [[#^note-47a|Nebo]]. ^verse-47

**48**  And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. ^verse-48

**49**  And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab. ^verse-49

**50**  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, ^verse-50

**51**  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; ^verse-51

**52**  Then ye shall [[#^note-52a|drive]] out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their [[#^note-52b|pictures]], and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their [[#^note-52c|high places]]: ^verse-52

**53**  And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. ^verse-53

**54**  And ye shall divide the [[#^note-54a|land]] by [[#^note-54b|lot]] for an [[#^note-54c|inheritance]] among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. ^verse-54

**55**  But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be [[#^note-55a|pricks]] in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. ^verse-55

**56**  Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. ^verse-56
