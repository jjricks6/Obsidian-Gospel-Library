*Moses specifies the borders of Israel's inheritance in Canaan and names the princes of the tribes who will divide the land.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of [[#^note-2a|Canaan]]; (this is the [[#^note-2b|land]] that shall fall unto you for an [[#^note-2c|inheritance]], even the land of Canaan [[#^note-2d|with the coasts thereof]]:) ^verse-2

**3**  Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of [[#^note-3a|Zin]] along by the [[#^note-3b|coast]] of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the [[#^note-3c|salt sea]] eastward: ^verse-3

**4**  And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon: ^verse-4

**5**  And the border shall [[#^note-5a|fetch a compass from]] Azmon unto [[#^note-5b|the]] river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea. ^verse-5

**6**  And as for the [[#^note-6a|western]] border, ye shall even have [[#^note-6b|the]] [[#^note-6c|great sea]] for a border: this shall be your west border. ^verse-6

**7**  And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor: ^verse-7

**8**  From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad: ^verse-8

**9**  Â¶ And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border. ^verse-9

**10**  And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham: ^verse-10

**11**  And the [[#^note-11a|coast]] shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of [[#^note-11b|the sea of Chinnereth]] eastward: ^verse-11

**12**  And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the [[#^note-12a|salt]] [[#^note-12b|sea]]: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about. ^verse-12

**13**  And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the [[#^note-13a|land]] which ye shall [[#^note-13b|inherit]] by lot, which the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: ^verse-13

**14**  For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the [[#^note-14a|house]] of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their [[#^note-14b|inheritance]]; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance: ^verse-14

**15**  The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan [[#^note-15a|near Jericho eastward]], toward the sunrising. ^verse-15

**16**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-16

**17**  These are the names of the men which shall divide the [[#^note-17a|land]] unto you: Eleazar the priest, and [[#^note-17b|Joshua]] the son of Nun. ^verse-17

**18**  And ye shall take one [[#^note-18a|prince]] of every [[#^note-18b|tribe]], to divide the land by inheritance. ^verse-18

**19**  And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. ^verse-19

**20**  And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. ^verse-20

**21**  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. ^verse-21

**22**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli. ^verse-22

**23**  The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. ^verse-23

**24**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. ^verse-24

**25**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. ^verse-25

**26**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan. ^verse-26

**27**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. ^verse-27

**28**  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. ^verse-28

**29**  These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan. ^verse-29
