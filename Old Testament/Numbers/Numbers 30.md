*Vows and oaths must be keptâ€”Fathers may disallow vows of daughters, and husbands may disallow vows of wives.*

**1**  And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded. ^verse-1

**2**  If a man [[#^note-2a|vow]] a vow unto the Lord, or swear an [[#^note-2b|oath]] to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not [[#^note-2c|break]] his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. ^verse-2

**3**  If a [[#^note-3a|woman]] also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; ^verse-3

**4**  And her father hear her vow, and her [[#^note-4a|bond]] wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. ^verse-4

**5**  But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. ^verse-5

**6**  And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; ^verse-6

**7**  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. ^verse-7

**8**  But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her. ^verse-8

**9**  But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. ^verse-9

**10**  And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; ^verse-10

**11**  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. ^verse-11

**12**  But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her. ^verse-12

**13**  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. ^verse-13

**14**  But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. ^verse-14

**15**  But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. ^verse-15

**16**  These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house. ^verse-16
