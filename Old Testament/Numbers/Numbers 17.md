*As a test, a rod for each tribe is placed in the tabernacle of witness—Aaron's rod buds and blossoms and brings forth almonds—It is kept as a token against rebels.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Spe[[#^note-2a|a]]k unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. ^verse-2

**3**  And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers. ^verse-3

**4**  And thou shalt lay them up in the [[#^note-4a|tabernacle of the congregation]] before the testimony, where I will [[#^note-4b|meet]] with you. ^verse-4

**5**  And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall [[#^note-5a|choose]], shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their [[#^note-6a|princes]] gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. ^verse-6

**7**  And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the [[#^note-7a|tabernacle]] of witness. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. ^verse-8

**9**  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring [[#^note-10a|Aaron's]] rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. ^verse-10

**11**  And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he. ^verse-11

**12**  And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. ^verse-12

**13**  Whosoever cometh [[#^note-13a|any thing]] near unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall [[#^note-13b|die]]: [[#^note-13c|shall]] we be consumed with dying? ^verse-13
