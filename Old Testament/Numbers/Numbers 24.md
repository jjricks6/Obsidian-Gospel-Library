*Balaam sees in vision and prophesies of the destiny of Israel—He prophesies of the Messiah: There will come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre will rise out of Israel.*

**1**  And when Balaam saw that it [[#^note-1a|pleased]] the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. ^verse-1

**2**  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their [[#^note-2a|tribes]]; and the spirit of God came upon him. ^verse-2

**3**  And he took up his [[#^note-3a|parable]], and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: ^verse-3

**4**  He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the [[#^note-4a|vision]] of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: ^verse-4

**5**  How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy [[#^note-5a|tabernacles]], O Israel! ^verse-5

**6**  As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the [[#^note-6a|trees]] of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|He]] shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than [[#^note-7b|Agag]], and his kingdom shall be exalted. ^verse-7

**8**  God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall [[#^note-8a|break]] their bones, and [[#^note-8b|pierce]] them through with his arrows. ^verse-8

**9**  He couched, he lay down as a [[#^note-9a|lion]], and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour. ^verse-11

**12**  And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, ^verse-12

**13**  If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own [[#^note-13a|mind]]; but what the Lord saith, that will I [[#^note-13b|speak]]? ^verse-13

**14**  And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will [[#^note-14a|advertise]] thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: ^verse-15

**16**  He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: ^verse-16

**17**  I shall see him, but [[#^note-17a|not now]]: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a [[#^note-17b|Star]] out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of [[#^note-17c|Moab]], and destroy all the children of Sheth. ^verse-17

**18**  And [[#^note-18a|Edom]] shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. ^verse-18

**19**  Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And when he looked on [[#^note-20a|Amalek]], he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever. ^verse-20

**21**  And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. ^verse-21

**22**  Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. ^verse-22

**23**  And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! ^verse-23

**24**  And ships shall come from the coast of [[#^note-24a|Chittim]], and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. ^verse-24

**25**  And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. ^verse-25
