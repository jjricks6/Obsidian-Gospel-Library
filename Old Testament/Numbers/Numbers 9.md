*Israel is again commanded to keep the Passover—A cloud rests upon the tabernacle by day and by night, plus a fire by night—When the cloud rests, Israel camps; when it lifts, they journey.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the [[#^note-1a|second]] year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. ^verse-2

**3**  In the [[#^note-3a|fourteenth]] day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. ^verse-3

**4**  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. ^verse-4

**5**  And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And there were certain men, who were [[#^note-6a|defiled]] by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: ^verse-6

**7**  And those men said unto him, We are defiled by [[#^note-7a|the]] dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel? ^verse-7

**8**  And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will [[#^note-8a|hear]] what the Lord will command concerning you. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-9

**10**  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  The fourteenth day of the [[#^note-11a|second]] month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with [[#^note-11b|unleavened]] bread and bitter herbs. ^verse-11

**12**  They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor [[#^note-12a|break]] any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. ^verse-12

**13**  But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. ^verse-13

**14**  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the [[#^note-14a|passover]] unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the [[#^note-14b|stranger]], and for him that was born in the land. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the [[#^note-15a|cloud]] covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. ^verse-15

**16**  So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. ^verse-16

**17**  And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. ^verse-17

**18**  At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. ^verse-18

**19**  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord, and [[#^note-19a|journeyed]] not. ^verse-19

**20**  And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed. ^verse-20

**21**  And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. ^verse-21

**22**  Or whether it were two days, or a month, or [[#^note-22a|a year]], that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. ^verse-22

**23**  At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the charge of the Lord, at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. ^verse-23
