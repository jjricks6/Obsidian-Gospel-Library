**1**  And the Lord [[#^note-1a|spake]] unto Moses in the [[#^note-1b|wilderness]] of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the [[#^note-1c|second]] month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Take ye the [[#^note-2a|sum]] of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their [[#^note-2b|families]], by the house of their [[#^note-2c|fathers]], with the number of their names, every male by [[#^note-2d|their polls]]; ^verse-2

**3**  From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. ^verse-3

**4**  And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one [[#^note-4a|head]] of the house of his fathers. ^verse-4

**34**  ¶ Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; ^verse-34

**35**  Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of [[#^note-35a|Manasseh]], were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; ^verse-36

**37**  Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. ^verse-37

**46**  Even all they that were [[#^note-46a|numbered]] were [[#^note-46b|six]] hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. ^verse-46

**47**  ¶ But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. ^verse-47

**48**  For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, ^verse-48

**49**  Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: ^verse-49

**50**  But thou shalt appoint the [[#^note-50a|Levites]] over the [[#^note-50b|tabernacle]] of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. ^verse-50

**51**  And when [[#^note-51a|the]] tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the [[#^note-51b|stranger]] that cometh nigh shall be [[#^note-51c|put to death]]. ^verse-51

**52**  And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. ^verse-52

**53**  But the Levites shall pitch round about the [[#^note-53a|tabernacle]] of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the [[#^note-53b|tabernacle]] of testimony. ^verse-53

**54**  And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they. ^verse-54
