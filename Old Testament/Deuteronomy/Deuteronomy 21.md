*How amends are made for murders by unknown persons—Equity is required in dealing with wives and children—Stubborn and rebellious sons will be put to death.*

**1**  If one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him: ^verse-1

**2**  Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure [[#^note-2a|unto]] the cities which are round about him that is slain: ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been [[#^note-3a|wrought]] with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; ^verse-3

**4**  And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither [[#^note-4a|eared]] nor sown, and shall [[#^note-4b|strike]] off the heifer's neck there in the valley: ^verse-4

**5**  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the Lord; and by their word shall every controversy and every [[#^note-5a|stroke]] be tried: ^verse-5

**6**  And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer [[#^note-6a|that is beheaded]] in the valley: ^verse-6

**7**  And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Be merciful]], O Lord, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast [[#^note-8b|redeemed]], and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. ^verse-8

**9**  So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, ^verse-10

**11**  And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; ^verse-11

**12**  Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; ^verse-12

**13**  And she shall put the [[#^note-13a|raiment of her captivity]] from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. ^verse-13

**14**  And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not [[#^note-14a|sell]] her at all for money, thou shalt not [[#^note-14b|make merchandise of her]], because thou hast humbled her. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another [[#^note-15a|hated]], and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated: ^verse-15

**16**  Then it shall be, when he [[#^note-16a|make]]th his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn: ^verse-16

**17**  But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a [[#^note-17a|double]] portion of all that he hath: for he is [[#^note-17b|the]] [[#^note-17c|beginning]] of his strength; the right of the [[#^note-17d|firstborn]] is his. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ If a man have a [[#^note-18a|stubborn]] and rebellious son, which will not [[#^note-18b|obey]] the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: ^verse-18

**19**  Then shall his fa[[#^note-19a|the]]r and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; ^verse-19

**20**  And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. ^verse-20

**21**  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: ^verse-22

**23**  His [[#^note-23a|body]] shall not [[#^note-23b|remain]] all night upon the [[#^note-23c|tree]], but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is [[#^note-23d|accursed]] of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an [[#^note-23e|inheritance]]. ^verse-23
