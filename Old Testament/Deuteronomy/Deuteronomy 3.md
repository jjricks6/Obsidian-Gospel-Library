*The children of Israel destroy the people of Bashan—Their lands, on the east of the Jordan, are given to Reuben and Gad—Moses sees Canaan from Pisgah but is denied entrance thereto—He counsels and strengthens Joshua.*

**1**  Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. ^verse-2

**3**  So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we [[#^note-3a|smote]] him until none was left to him remaining. ^verse-3

**4**  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. ^verse-4

**5**  All these cities were fenced with high [[#^note-5a|walls]], gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. ^verse-5

**6**  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. ^verse-6

**7**  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. ^verse-7

**8**  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was [[#^note-8a|on this side Jordan]], from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; ^verse-8

**9**  (Which [[#^note-9a|Hermon]] the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it [[#^note-9b|Shenir]];) ^verse-9

**10**  All the cities of the [[#^note-10a|plain]], and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. ^verse-10

**11**  For only [[#^note-11a|Og]] king of Bashan remained of the remnant of [[#^note-11b|giants]]; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine [[#^note-11c|cubits]] was the length thereof, and four [[#^note-11d|cubit]]s the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. ^verse-11

**12**  And this land, which we possessed at that time, from [[#^note-12a|Aroer]], which is by the river Arnon, and half [[#^note-12b|mount Gilead]], and the cities thereof, gave I unto the [[#^note-12c|Reubenites]] and to the Gadites. ^verse-12

**13**  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of [[#^note-13a|Manasseh]]; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. ^verse-13

**14**  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the [[#^note-14a|coasts]] of [[#^note-14b|Geshuri]] and Maachathi; and called [[#^note-14c|them]] after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day. ^verse-14

**15**  And I gave Gilead unto Machir. ^verse-15

**16**  And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river [[#^note-16a|Arnon]] [[#^note-16b|half the valley]], and the border even unto the river [[#^note-16c|Jabbok]], which is the border of the children of Ammon; ^verse-16

**17**  The [[#^note-17a|plain]] also, [[#^note-17b|and Jordan]], and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the [[#^note-17c|sea]] of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye sh[[#^note-18a|all]] pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. ^verse-18

**19**  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; ^verse-19

**20**  Until the Lord have given [[#^note-20a|rest]] unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And I commanded [[#^note-21a|Joshua]] at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. ^verse-21

**22**  Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall [[#^note-22a|fight]] for you. ^verse-22

**23**  And I besought the Lord at that time, saying, ^verse-23

**24**  O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty [[#^note-24a|hand]]: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? ^verse-24

**25**  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and [[#^note-25a|Lebanon]]. ^verse-25

**26**  But the Lord was [[#^note-26a|wroth]] with me for your [[#^note-26b|sakes]], and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. ^verse-26

**27**  Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. ^verse-27

**28**  But [[#^note-28a|charge]] Joshua, and encourage him, and [[#^note-28b|strengthen]] him: for he shall [[#^note-28c|go]] over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. ^verse-28

**29**  So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. ^verse-29
