*The tables of stone containing the Ten Commandments are placed in the ark—All that God requires is that Israel love and serve Him—How great and mighty is the Lord!*

**1**  At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two [[#^note-1a|tables]] of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an [[#^note-1b|ark]] of wood. ^verse-1

**2**  And I will [[#^note-2a|write]] on the tables the words that were in the first tables [[#^note-2b|which]] thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. ^verse-2

**3**  And I made an ark of [[#^note-3a|shittim]] wood, and hewed two [[#^note-3b|tables]] of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. ^verse-3

**4**  And he [[#^note-4a|wrote]] on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me. ^verse-4

**5**  And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there [[#^note-6a|Aaron]] died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. ^verse-6

**7**  From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to [[#^note-7a|Jotbath]], a land of [[#^note-7b|rivers of waters]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ At that time the Lord [[#^note-8a|separated]] the tribe of [[#^note-8b|Levi]], to [[#^note-8c|bear]] the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to [[#^note-8d|bless]] in his name, unto this day. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore [[#^note-9a|Levi]] hath no [[#^note-9b|part]] nor [[#^note-9c|inheritance]] with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him. ^verse-9

**10**  And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy thee. ^verse-10

**11**  And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy [[#^note-11a|journey]] before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God [[#^note-12a|require]] of thee, but to [[#^note-12b|fear]] the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to [[#^note-12c|serve]] the Lord thy God with all thy [[#^note-12d|heart]] and with all thy soul, ^verse-12

**13**  To keep the [[#^note-13a|commandments]] of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy [[#^note-13b|good]]? ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, the [[#^note-14a|heaven]] and the heaven of heavens is the Lord's thy God, the [[#^note-14b|earth]] also, with [[#^note-14c|all]] that therein is. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Only]] the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to [[#^note-15b|love]] them, and he [[#^note-15c|chose]] their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Circumcise]] therefore the foreskin of your [[#^note-16b|heart]], and be no more [[#^note-16c|stiffnecked]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For the Lord your [[#^note-17a|God]] is [[#^note-17b|God]] of gods, and [[#^note-17c|Lord of lords]], a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, [[#^note-17d|which]] [[#^note-17e|regardeth]] not persons, nor taketh [[#^note-17f|reward]]: ^verse-17

**18**  He [[#^note-18a|doth]] execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and [[#^note-18b|loveth]] the [[#^note-18c|stranger]], in giving him [[#^note-18d|food]] and raiment. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Love]] ye therefore the [[#^note-19b|stranger]]: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou [[#^note-20a|cleave]], and [[#^note-20b|swear by]] his name. ^verse-20

**21**  He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these [[#^note-21a|great and terrible]] things, which thine eyes have seen. ^verse-21

**22**  Thy [[#^note-22a|fathers]] went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the [[#^note-22b|stars]] of heaven for multitude. ^verse-22
