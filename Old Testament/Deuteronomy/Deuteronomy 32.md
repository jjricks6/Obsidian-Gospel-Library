[[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 31|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 33|Next Entry]]

*Israel will sing the song of Moses and acclaim: God speaks to heaven and earth; the children of Israel were known in the premortal life; God chose them in this life; they forgot the Rock of their salvation; He sent terror, a sword, and vengeance upon them; there is no God beside Him—Moses will be gathered to his people.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Give]] ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and [[#^note-1b|hear]], O earth, the [[#^note-1c|words]] of my mouth. ^verse-1

**2**  My doctrine shall drop as the [[#^note-2a|rain]], my [[#^note-2b|speech]] shall distil as the [[#^note-2c|dew]], as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: ^verse-2

**3**  Because I will [[#^note-3a|publish]] the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. ^verse-3

**4**  He is the [[#^note-4a|Rock]], his work is [[#^note-4b|perfect]]: for all his ways are [[#^note-4c|judgment]]: a God of truth and without iniquity, [[#^note-4d|just]] and right is he. ^verse-4

**5**  They have corrupted themselves, [[#^note-5a|their]] spot is not the spot of his [[#^note-5b|children]]: they are a [[#^note-5c|perverse]] and crooked [[#^note-5d|generation]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Do ye thus [[#^note-6a|requite]] the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy [[#^note-6b|father]] that hath [[#^note-6c|bought]] thee? hath he not [[#^note-6d|made]] thee, and established thee? ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ [[#^note-7a|Remember]] the days of old, consider the years of many generations: [[#^note-7b|ask]] thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. ^verse-7

**8**  When the most High divided to the [[#^note-8a|nations]] their [[#^note-8b|inheritance]], when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the [[#^note-8c|bounds]] of the people according to the number of the children of Israel. ^verse-8

**9**  For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his [[#^note-9a|inheritance]]. ^verse-9

**10**  He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he [[#^note-10a|led him about]], he instructed him, he kept him as the [[#^note-10b|apple]] of his eye. ^verse-10

**11**  As an [[#^note-11a|eagle]] stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: ^verse-11

**12**  So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. ^verse-12

**13**  He made him ride on the [[#^note-13a|high places]] of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; ^verse-13

**14**  Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure [[#^note-14a|blood]] of the [[#^note-14b|grape]]. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ But [[#^note-15a|Jeshurun]] waxed [[#^note-15b|fat]], and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he [[#^note-15c|forsook]] God which made him, and lightly esteemed the [[#^note-15d|Rock]] of his salvation. ^verse-15

**16**  They [[#^note-16a|provoked]] him to [[#^note-16b|jealousy]] with strange [[#^note-16c|gods]], with abominations provoked they him to anger. ^verse-16

**17**  They [[#^note-17a|sacrificed]] unto devils, [[#^note-17b|not to God]]; to [[#^note-17c|gods]] whom they knew not, to new [[#^note-17d|gods]] that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. ^verse-17

**18**  Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that [[#^note-18a|formed thee]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And when the Lord saw it, he [[#^note-19a|abhorred]] them, because of the [[#^note-19b|provoking]] of his sons, and of his daughters. ^verse-19

**20**  And he said, I will [[#^note-20a|hide]] my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a [[#^note-20b|very froward]] generation, children in whom is no [[#^note-20c|faith]]. ^verse-20

**21**  They have moved me to [[#^note-21a|jealousy]] with that which is not God; they have [[#^note-21b|provoked]] me to [[#^note-21c|anger]] with their vanities: and I will move them to [[#^note-21d|jealousy]] with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. ^verse-21

**22**  For a [[#^note-22a|fire]] is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. ^verse-22

**23**  I will heap [[#^note-23a|mischiefs]] upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. ^verse-23

**24**  They shall be [[#^note-24a|burnt]] with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. ^verse-24

**25**  The [[#^note-25a|sword]] without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. ^verse-25

**26**  I said, I would [[#^note-26a|scatter them into corners]], I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: ^verse-26

**27**  Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is [[#^note-27a|high]], and the Lord hath not done all this. ^verse-27

**28**  For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. ^verse-28

**29**  O that they were [[#^note-29a|wise]], that they understood this, that they would consider their latter [[#^note-29b|end]]! ^verse-29

**30**  How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to [[#^note-30a|flight]], except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? ^verse-30

**31**  For their rock is not as our [[#^note-31a|Rock]], even our enemies themselves being judges. ^verse-31

**32**  For their vine is of the vine of [[#^note-32a|Sodom]], and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: ^verse-32

**33**  Their [[#^note-33a|wine]] is the poison of [[#^note-33b|dragons]], and the cruel venom of asps. ^verse-33

**34**  Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? ^verse-34

**35**  To me belongeth [[#^note-35a|vengeance]], and [[#^note-35b|recompence]]; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their [[#^note-35c|calamity]] is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. ^verse-35

**36**  For the Lord shall [[#^note-36a|judge]] his people, and [[#^note-36b|repent]] himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none [[#^note-36c|shut up, or left]]. ^verse-36

**37**  And he shall say, Where are their [[#^note-37a|gods]], their rock in whom they [[#^note-37b|trusted]], ^verse-37

**38**  Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. ^verse-38

**39**  See now that I, even I, [[#^note-39a|am]] he, and there is no god [[#^note-39b|with me]]: [[#^note-39c|I]] kill, and I make [[#^note-39d|alive]]; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. ^verse-39

**40**  For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I [[#^note-40a|live]] for ever. ^verse-40

**41**  If I whet my glittering [[#^note-41a|sword]], and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. ^verse-41

**42**  I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. ^verse-42

**43**  Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will [[#^note-43a|avenge]] the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be [[#^note-43b|merciful]] unto his land, and to his people. ^verse-43

**44**  ¶ And Moses came and spake all the words of this [[#^note-44a|song]] in the ears of the people, he, and [[#^note-44b|Hoshea]] the son of Nun. ^verse-44

**45**  And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to [[#^note-45a|all Israel]]: ^verse-45

**46**  And he said unto them, Set your [[#^note-46a|hearts]] unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your [[#^note-46b|children]] to observe to do, all the words of this law. ^verse-46

**47**  For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall [[#^note-47a|prolong]] your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. ^verse-47

**48**  And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, ^verse-48

**49**  Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount [[#^note-49a|Nebo]], which is in the land of Moab, that is [[#^note-49b|over against]] Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: ^verse-49

**50**  And [[#^note-50a|die]] in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as [[#^note-50b|Aaron]] thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: ^verse-50

**51**  Because ye [[#^note-51a|trespassed]] against me among the children of Israel at the waters of [[#^note-51b|Meribah-Kadesh]], in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. ^verse-51

**52**  Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel. ^verse-52
