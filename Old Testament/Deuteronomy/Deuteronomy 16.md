[[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 17|Next Entry]]

*Israel is to keep the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles—All males are to appear annually before the Lord at these three feasts—Judges are not to make dishonest judgments nor take gifts.*

**1**  Observe the month of [[#^note-1a|Abib]], and keep the [[#^note-1b|passover]] unto the Lord thy God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the [[#^note-2a|passover]] unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the [[#^note-2b|place]] which the Lord shall choose to place his name there. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou shalt eat no [[#^note-3a|leavened]] bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat [[#^note-3b|unleavened]] bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in [[#^note-3c|haste]]: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. ^verse-3

**4**  And there shall be no [[#^note-4a|leavened]] bread seen with thee in all thy [[#^note-4b|coast]] seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, [[#^note-4c|remain]] all night until the morning. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy [[#^note-5a|gates]], which the Lord thy God giveth thee: ^verse-5

**6**  But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the [[#^note-6a|passover]] at even, at the going down of the sun, at the [[#^note-6b|season]] that thou camest forth out of Egypt. ^verse-6

**7**  And thou shalt [[#^note-7a|roast]] and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. ^verse-7

**8**  Six days thou shalt eat [[#^note-8a|unleavened]] bread: and on the seventh day shall be a [[#^note-8b|solemn assembly]] to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work therein. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the [[#^note-9a|corn]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And thou shalt keep the feast of [[#^note-10a|weeks]] unto the Lord thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the Lord thy God, according as the Lord thy God hath [[#^note-10b|blessed]] thee: ^verse-10

**11**  And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to place his name there. ^verse-11

**12**  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a [[#^note-12a|bondman]] in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Thou shalt observe the feast of [[#^note-13a|tabernacles]] seven days, [[#^note-13b|after]] that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: ^verse-13

**14**  And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates. ^verse-14

**15**  Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose: because the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ [[#^note-16a|Three]] times in a year shall all thy males [[#^note-16b|appear]] before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the [[#^note-16c|feast]] of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the Lord empty: ^verse-16

**17**  Every man shall [[#^note-17a|give]] as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ [[#^note-18a|Judges]] and [[#^note-18b|officers]] shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou shalt not [[#^note-19a|wrest]] [[#^note-19b|judgment]]; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a [[#^note-19c|gift]]: for a gift doth [[#^note-19d|blind]] the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. ^verse-19

**20**  That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ [[#^note-21a|Thou]] shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee. ^verse-21

**22**  Neither shalt thou set thee up any [[#^note-22a|image]]; which the Lord thy God hateth. ^verse-22
