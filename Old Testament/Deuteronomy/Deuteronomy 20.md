*Laws are revealed for selecting soldiers and making war—Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites will be utterly destroyed.*

**1**  When thou goest out to [[#^note-1a|battle]] against thine enemies, and seest horses, and [[#^note-1b|chariots]], and a people more than thou, be not [[#^note-1c|afraid]] of them: for the [[#^note-1d|Lord]] thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-1

**2**  And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, ^verse-2

**3**  And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; ^verse-3

**4**  For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to [[#^note-4a|fight]] for you against your enemies, to save you. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. ^verse-5

**6**  And what man is he that hath planted a [[#^note-6a|vineyard]], and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. ^verse-6

**7**  And what man is there that hath betrothed a [[#^note-7a|wife]], and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. ^verse-7

**8**  And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is [[#^note-8a|fearful]] and [[#^note-8b|faint]]hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ When thou comest nigh unto a city to [[#^note-10a|fight]] against it, then proclaim [[#^note-10b|peace]] unto it. ^verse-10

**11**  And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be [[#^note-11a|tributaries]] unto thee, and they shall serve thee. ^verse-11

**12**  And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: ^verse-12

**13**  And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: ^verse-13

**14**  But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt [[#^note-14a|eat]] the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee. ^verse-14

**15**  Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. ^verse-15

**16**  But of the [[#^note-16a|cities]] of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: ^verse-16

**17**  But thou shalt utterly [[#^note-17a|destroy]] them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee: ^verse-17

**18**  That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the Lord your God. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by [[#^note-19a|for]]cing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege: ^verse-19

**20**  Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for [[#^note-20a|meat]], thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued. ^verse-20
