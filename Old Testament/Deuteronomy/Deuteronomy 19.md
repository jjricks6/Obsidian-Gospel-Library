### Chapter 19

[[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 18|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 20|Next Entry]]

*Cities of refuge are appointed for cases of manslaughter—Murderers will be put to death—Two or three witnesses are required in court cases—False witnesses will be punished.*

**1**  When the Lord thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee, and [[#^note-1a|thou succeedest]] them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses; ^verse-1

**2**  Thou shalt [[#^note-2a|separate]] three [[#^note-2b|cities]] for thee in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou shalt prepare thee [[#^note-3a|a way]], and divide the [[#^note-3b|coasts]] of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may [[#^note-3c|flee]] thither. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour [[#^note-4a|ignorantly]], whom he hated not in time past; ^verse-4

**5**  As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: ^verse-5

**6**  Lest the [[#^note-6a|avenger]] of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. ^verse-7

**8**  And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy [[#^note-8a|coast]], as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; ^verse-8

**9**  If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to [[#^note-9a|walk]] ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: ^verse-9

**10**  That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ But if any man hate his [[#^note-11a|neighbour]], and [[#^note-11b|lie]] in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities: ^verse-11

**12**  Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. ^verse-12

**13**  Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt [[#^note-13a|put away]] the [[#^note-13b|guilt]] of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's [[#^note-14a|landmark]], which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ One [[#^note-15a|witness]] shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two [[#^note-15b|witnesses]], or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ If a [[#^note-16a|false witness]] rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong; ^verse-16

**17**  Then both the men, between whom the [[#^note-17a|controversy]] is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days; ^verse-17

**18**  And the [[#^note-18a|judges]] shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; ^verse-18

**19**  Then shall ye [[#^note-19a|do]] unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. ^verse-19

**20**  And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you. ^verse-20

**21**  And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, [[#^note-21a|eye for eye]], tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. ^verse-21
