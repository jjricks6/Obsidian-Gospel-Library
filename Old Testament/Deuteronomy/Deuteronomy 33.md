*Moses blesses the tribes of Israel—Levi is blessed to teach the Lord's judgments and His law—Joseph is blessed above all; the Lord will gather Israel in the latter days—Israel will triumph.*

**1**  And this is the blessing, wherewith [[#^note-1a|Moses]] the [[#^note-1b|man]] of God [[#^note-1c|blessed]] the children of [[#^note-1d|Israel]] before his death. ^verse-1

**2**  And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he [[#^note-2a|shined]] forth from mount [[#^note-2b|Paran]], and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, he loved the people; all his [[#^note-3a|saints]] are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy [[#^note-3b|feet]]; every one shall receive of thy words. ^verse-3

**4**  Moses commanded us a [[#^note-4a|law]], even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. ^verse-4

**5**  And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Let [[#^note-6a|Reuben]] live, and not die; and let not his men be [[#^note-6b|few]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And this is the blessing of [[#^note-7a|Judah]]: and he said, Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an [[#^note-7b|help]] to him from his enemies. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And of [[#^note-8a|Levi]] he said, Let thy Thummim and thy [[#^note-8b|Urim]] be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst [[#^note-8c|strive]] at the waters of [[#^note-8d|Meribah]]; ^verse-8

**9**  Who said [[#^note-9a|unto]] his father and to his mother, I [[#^note-9b|have not seen him]]; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. ^verse-9

**10**  They shall [[#^note-10a|teach]] Jacob thy [[#^note-10b|judgments]], and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. ^verse-10

**11**  Bless, Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And of [[#^note-12a|Benjamin]] he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And of [[#^note-13a|Joseph]] he said, Blessed of the Lord be his [[#^note-13b|land]], for the [[#^note-13c|precious]] things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, ^verse-13

**14**  And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, ^verse-14

**15**  And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting [[#^note-15a|hills]], ^verse-15

**16**  And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the [[#^note-16a|bush]]: let the [[#^note-16b|blessing]] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. ^verse-16

**17**  His [[#^note-17a|glory]] is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of [[#^note-17b|unicorns]]: with them he shall [[#^note-17c|push]] the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of [[#^note-17d|Ephraim]], and they are the thousands of Manasseh. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And of [[#^note-18a|Zebulun]] he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, [[#^note-18b|Issachar]], in thy tents. ^verse-18

**19**  They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And of [[#^note-20a|Gad]] he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm [[#^note-20b|with]] the crown of the head. ^verse-20

**21**  And he provided the [[#^note-21a|first]] part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came [[#^note-21b|with]] the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And of [[#^note-22a|Dan]] he said, Dan is a [[#^note-22b|lion's]] whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And of [[#^note-23a|Naphtali]] he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord: possess thou the [[#^note-23b|west]] and the south. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And of [[#^note-24a|Asher]] he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. ^verse-24

**25**  Thy [[#^note-25a|shoes]] shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ There is none like unto the God of [[#^note-26a|Jeshurun]], who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his [[#^note-26b|excellency on]] the sky. ^verse-26

**27**  The [[#^note-27a|eternal]] God is thy [[#^note-27b|refuge]], and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the [[#^note-27c|enemy]] from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. ^verse-27

**28**  [[#^note-28a|Israel]] then shall dwell in [[#^note-28b|safety]] alone: the [[#^note-28c|fountain]] of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his [[#^note-28d|heavens]] shall drop down dew. ^verse-28

**29**  [[#^note-29a|Happy]] art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the [[#^note-29b|shield]] of thy help, and who is the sword of thy [[#^note-29c|excellency]]! and thine enemies shall [[#^note-29d|be found liars unto]] thee; and thou shalt tread upon their [[#^note-29e|high places]]. ^verse-29
