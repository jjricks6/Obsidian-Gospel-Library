[[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 7|Next Entry]]

*Moses proclaims, The Lord our God is one Lord, and, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God—The children of Israel are commanded to teach their children—Moses exhorts them to keep the commandments, testimonies, and statutes of the Lord that they may prosper.*

**1**  Now these are the commandments, the [[#^note-1a|statutes]], and the [[#^note-1b|judgments]], which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: ^verse-1

**2**  That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be [[#^note-2a|prolonged]]. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Hear therefore, O Israel, and [[#^note-3a|observe]] to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Hear]], O Israel: The Lord our God is [[#^note-4b|one]] Lord: ^verse-4

**5**  And thou shalt [[#^note-5a|love]] the Lord thy God with all thine [[#^note-5b|heart]], and with all thy soul, and with all thy [[#^note-5c|might]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And these [[#^note-6a|words]], which I command thee this day, shall be in thine [[#^note-6b|heart]]: ^verse-6

**7**  And thou shalt [[#^note-7a|teach]] them diligently unto thy children, and shalt [[#^note-7b|talk]] of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. ^verse-7

**8**  And thou shalt [[#^note-8a|bind]] them for a [[#^note-8b|sign]] upon thine hand, and they shall be as [[#^note-8c|frontlets]] between thine eyes. ^verse-8

**9**  And thou shalt write them upon the [[#^note-9a|posts]] of thy house, and on thy gates. ^verse-9

**10**  And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, ^verse-10

**11**  And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; ^verse-11

**12**  Then beware lest thou [[#^note-12a|forget]] the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou shalt [[#^note-13a|fear]] the Lord thy God, and [[#^note-13b|serve]] him, and shalt [[#^note-13c|swear]] by his name. ^verse-13

**14**  Ye shall not go after [[#^note-14a|other]] [[#^note-14b|gods]], of the gods of the people which are round about you; ^verse-14

**15**  (For the Lord thy God is a [[#^note-15a|jealous]] God among you) lest the [[#^note-15b|anger]] of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Ye shall not [[#^note-16a|tempt]] the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. ^verse-16

**17**  Ye shall [[#^note-17a|diligently]] keep the [[#^note-17b|commandments]] of the Lord your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. ^verse-17

**18**  And thou shalt do that which is [[#^note-18a|right]] and good in the sight of the Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord [[#^note-18b|sware]] unto thy fathers, ^verse-18

**19**  To [[#^note-19a|cast out]] all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath spoken. ^verse-19

**20**  And when thy son [[#^note-20a|asketh]] thee in time to come, saying, What mean the [[#^note-20b|testimonies]], and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded you? ^verse-20

**21**  Then thou shalt say unto thy [[#^note-21a|son]], We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: ^verse-21

**22**  And the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and [[#^note-22a|sore]], upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: ^verse-22

**23**  And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. ^verse-23

**24**  And the Lord [[#^note-24a|commanded]] us to do all these statutes, to [[#^note-24b|fear]] the Lord our God, for our [[#^note-24c|good]] always, that he might [[#^note-24d|preserve]] us alive, as it is at this day. ^verse-24

**25**  And it shall be our [[#^note-25a|righteousness]], if we [[#^note-25b|observe]] to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us. ^verse-25
