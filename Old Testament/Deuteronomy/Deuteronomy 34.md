*Moses sees the promised land and is taken by the Lord—Joshua leads Israel—Moses was Israel's greatest prophet.*

**1**  And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is [[#^note-1a|over against]] Jericho. And the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, ^verse-1

**2**  And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto [[#^note-2a|the utmost sea]], ^verse-2

**3**  And the [[#^note-3a|south]], and the plain of the valley of [[#^note-3b|Jericho]], the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. ^verse-3

**4**  And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I [[#^note-4a|sware]] unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ So [[#^note-5a|Moses]] the servant of the Lord [[#^note-5b|died]] there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  And he [[#^note-6a|buried]] him in a valley in the land [[#^note-6b|of]] Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his [[#^note-6c|sepulchre]] unto this day. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And Moses was an [[#^note-7a|hundred]] and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and [[#^note-8a|mourning]] for Moses were ended. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And Joshua the son of [[#^note-9a|Nun]] was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had [[#^note-9b|laid]] his hands upon him: and the children of Israel [[#^note-9c|hearkened]] unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And there arose not a [[#^note-10a|prophet]] since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew [[#^note-10b|face to face]], ^verse-10

**11**  In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, ^verse-11

**12**  And in all that mighty [[#^note-12a|hand]], and in all the great [[#^note-12b|terror]] which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. ^verse-12
