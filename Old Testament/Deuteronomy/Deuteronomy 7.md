[[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Deuteronomy/Deuteronomy 8|Next Entry]]

*Israel is to destroy the seven nations of Canaan—Marriages with them are forbidden lest apostasy result—Israel has a mission as a holy and chosen people—The Lord shows mercy unto those who love Him and keep His commandments—He promises to remove sickness from the children of Israel if they obey.*

**1**  When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many [[#^note-1a|nations]] before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; ^verse-1

**2**  And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly [[#^note-2a|destroy]] them; thou shalt [[#^note-2b|make]] no [[#^note-2c|covenant]] with them, nor shew mercy unto them: ^verse-2

**3**  Neither shalt thou make [[#^note-3a|marriages]] with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. ^verse-3

**4**  For they will [[#^note-4a|turn away]] thy son from following me, that they may [[#^note-4b|serve]] other gods: so will the [[#^note-4c|anger]] of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. ^verse-4

**5**  But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall [[#^note-5a|destroy]] their altars, and break down their [[#^note-5b|images]], and cut down their [[#^note-5c|groves]], and burn their graven images with fire. ^verse-5

**6**  For thou art [[#^note-6a|an]] [[#^note-6b|holy]] people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath [[#^note-6c|chosen]] thee to be a [[#^note-6d|special]] people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: ^verse-7

**8**  But because the Lord [[#^note-8a|loved]] you, and because he would keep the [[#^note-8b|oath]] which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and [[#^note-8c|redeemed]] you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. ^verse-8

**9**  Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which [[#^note-9a|keepeth]] covenant and [[#^note-9b|mercy]] with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|repayeth]] them that hate him to their face, to [[#^note-10b|destroy]] them: he will not be slack to him that [[#^note-10c|hateth]] him, he will repay him to his face. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the [[#^note-11a|judgments]], which I [[#^note-11b|command]] thee this day, to do them. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye [[#^note-12a|hearken]] to these [[#^note-12b|judgments]], and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the [[#^note-12c|covenant]] and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: ^verse-12

**13**  And he will [[#^note-13a|love]] thee, and bless thee, and [[#^note-13b|multiply]] thee: he will also bless the [[#^note-13c|fruit]] of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy [[#^note-13d|corn]], and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female [[#^note-14a|barren]] among you, or among your cattle. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord will take away from thee all [[#^note-15a|sickness]], and will put none of the evil [[#^note-15b|diseases]] of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. ^verse-15

**16**  And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their [[#^note-16a|gods]]; for that will be a snare unto thee. ^verse-16

**17**  If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? ^verse-17

**18**  Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; ^verse-18

**19**  The great [[#^note-19a|temptations]] which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the [[#^note-19b|wonders]], and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid. ^verse-19

**20**  Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the Lord thy God is among you, a mighty God and [[#^note-21a|terrible]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And the Lord thy God will [[#^note-22a|put out]] those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the [[#^note-22b|beasts]] of the field increase upon thee. ^verse-22

**23**  But the Lord thy God shall [[#^note-23a|deliver]] them unto thee, and shall [[#^note-23b|destroy]] them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. ^verse-23

**24**  And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. ^verse-24

**25**  The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God. ^verse-25

**26**  Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. ^verse-26
