*Laws are given concerning divorce, newly married persons, making merchandise of men, taking pledges, leprosy, oppression of servants, and leaving gleanings of crops.*

**1**  When a man hath taken a [[#^note-1a|wife]], and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some [[#^note-1b|uncleanness]] in her: then let him write her a bill of [[#^note-1c|divorcement]], and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. ^verse-1

**2**  And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. ^verse-2

**3**  And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; ^verse-3

**4**  Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the Lord: and thou shalt not [[#^note-4a|cause]] the land to sin, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ When a man hath taken a new [[#^note-5a|wife]], he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall [[#^note-5b|cheer up]] his wife which he hath taken. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ No man shall take the [[#^note-6a|nether]] or the upper millstone to pledge: for [[#^note-6b|he taketh]] a man's life to pledge. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ If a man be found [[#^note-7a|stealing]] any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh [[#^note-7b|merchandise]] of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Take heed in the plague of [[#^note-8a|leprosy]], that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall [[#^note-8b|teach]] you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. ^verse-8

**9**  Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou shalt stand [[#^note-11a|abroad]], and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. ^verse-11

**12**  And if the man be poor, thou shalt not [[#^note-12a|sleep with his pledge]]: ^verse-12

**13**  In any case thou shalt deliver him the [[#^note-13a|pledge]] again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own [[#^note-13b|raiment]], and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Thou shalt not [[#^note-14a|oppress]] an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy [[#^note-14b|gates]]: ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|At his day]] thou shalt give him his [[#^note-15b|hire]], neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he [[#^note-15c|cry]] against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|fathers]] shall not be put to [[#^note-16b|death]] for the [[#^note-16c|children]], neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his [[#^note-16d|own]] [[#^note-16e|sin]]. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Thou shalt not [[#^note-17a|pervert]] the [[#^note-17b|judgment]] of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: ^verse-17

**18**  But thou shalt remember that thou wast a [[#^note-18a|bondman]] in Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the [[#^note-19a|widow]]: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. ^verse-19

**20**  When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. ^verse-20

**21**  When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. ^verse-21

**22**  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. ^verse-22
