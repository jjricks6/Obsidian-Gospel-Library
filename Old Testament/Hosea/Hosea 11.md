*Israel, as a child, was called out of Egypt in similitude of our Lord, as a child, coming out of Egypt—But Ephraim turns away from the Lord.*

**1**  When Israel was a child, then I [[#^note-1a|loved]] him, and called my [[#^note-1b|son]] out of [[#^note-1c|Egypt]]. ^verse-1

**2**  As they called them, so they went from them: they [[#^note-2a|sacrificed]] unto [[#^note-2b|Baalim]], and burned incense to graven images. ^verse-2

**3**  I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I [[#^note-3a|healed]] them. ^verse-3

**4**  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of [[#^note-4a|love]]: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ He shall not return into the land of [[#^note-5a|Egypt]], but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. ^verse-5

**6**  And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own [[#^note-6a|counsels]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And my people are bent to [[#^note-7a|backsliding]] from me: though they called them to the [[#^note-7b|most]] High, none at all would exalt him. ^verse-7

**8**  How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as [[#^note-8a|Admah]]? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned [[#^note-8b|within]] me, my repentings are kindled together. ^verse-8

**9**  I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not [[#^note-9a|enter]] into the city. ^verse-9

**10**  They shall [[#^note-10a|walk]] after the Lord: he shall roar like a [[#^note-10b|lion]]: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. ^verse-10

**11**  They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet [[#^note-12a|ruleth]] with God, and is faithful with the saints. ^verse-12
