*Israel will seek the Lord, return to the Lord, and receive of His goodness in the latter days.*

**1**  Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an [[#^note-1a|adulteress]], according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love [[#^note-1b|flagons of wine]]. ^verse-1

**2**  So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: ^verse-2

**3**  And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee. ^verse-3

**4**  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: ^verse-4

**5**  Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and [[#^note-5a|seek]] the Lord their God, and [[#^note-5b|David]] their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the [[#^note-5c|latter days]]. ^verse-5
