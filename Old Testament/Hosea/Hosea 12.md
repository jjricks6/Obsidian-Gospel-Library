*The Lord uses prophets, visions, and similitudes to guide His people, but they become rich and will not wait on the Lord—Ephraim provokes Him most bitterly.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Ephraim]] feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a [[#^note-1b|covenant]] with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord hath also a [[#^note-2a|controversy]] with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ He took his brother by the [[#^note-3a|heel]] in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, he had power over the [[#^note-4a|angel]], and [[#^note-4b|prevailed]]: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in [[#^note-4c|Beth-el]], and there he spake with [[#^note-4d|us]]; ^verse-4

**5**  Even the Lord God of hosts; the Lord is his [[#^note-5a|memorial]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore [[#^note-6a|turn]] thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ He is a merchant, the [[#^note-7a|balances]] of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. ^verse-7

**8**  And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin. ^verse-8

**9**  And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in [[#^note-9a|tabernacles]], as in the days of the solemn feast. ^verse-9

**10**  I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. ^verse-10

**11**  Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in [[#^note-11a|Gilgal]]; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields. ^verse-11

**12**  And Jacob fled into the country of [[#^note-12a|Syria]], and Israel served for a [[#^note-12b|wife]], and for a wife he kept sheep. ^verse-12

**13**  And by a [[#^note-13a|prophet]] the [[#^note-13b|Lord]] brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. ^verse-13

**14**  Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his [[#^note-14a|blood]] upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him. ^verse-14
