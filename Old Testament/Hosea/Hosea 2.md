*Worshipping false gods brings severe judgments upon Israel—In the last days, Israel will be reconciled to God and become His people.*

**1**  Say ye unto your brethren, [[#^note-1a|Ammi]]; and to your sisters, [[#^note-1b|Ruhamah]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Plead with your [[#^note-2a|mother]], plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; ^verse-2

**3**  Lest I [[#^note-3a|strip]] her [[#^note-3b|naked]], and set her as in the day that she was [[#^note-3c|born]], and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with [[#^note-3d|thirst]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. ^verse-4

**5**  For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done [[#^note-5a|shamefully]]: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my [[#^note-5b|bread]] and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Therefore, behold, I will [[#^note-6a|hedge]] up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. ^verse-6

**7**  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first [[#^note-7a|husband]]; for then was it better with me than now. ^verse-7

**8**  For she did not know that I gave her [[#^note-8a|corn]], and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. ^verse-9

**10**  And now will I discover her [[#^note-10a|lewdness]] in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. ^verse-10

**11**  I will also cause all her [[#^note-11a|mirth]] to [[#^note-11b|cease]], her feast days, her new [[#^note-11c|moons]], and her [[#^note-11d|sabbaths]], and all her [[#^note-11e|solemn]] feasts. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. ^verse-12

**13**  And I will visit upon her the days of [[#^note-13a|Baalim]], wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her [[#^note-13b|earrings]] and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the Lord. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the [[#^note-14a|wilderness]], and speak comfortably unto her. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of [[#^note-15a|Achor]] for a door of hope: and she shall [[#^note-15b|sing]] there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-15

**16**  And it shall be at that [[#^note-16a|day]], saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me [[#^note-16b|Ishi]]; and shalt call me no more [[#^note-16c|Baali]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For I will take away the names of [[#^note-17a|Baalim]] out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. ^verse-17

**18**  And in that day will I make a [[#^note-18a|covenant]] for them with the [[#^note-18b|beasts]] of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down [[#^note-18c|safely]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will [[#^note-19a|betroth]] thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. ^verse-19

**20**  I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt [[#^note-20a|know]] the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; ^verse-21

**22**  And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. ^verse-22

**23**  And I will sow [[#^note-23a|her]] unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to [[#^note-23b|them]] which were not my [[#^note-23c|people]], Thou art my [[#^note-23d|people]]; and they shall say, Thou art my God. ^verse-23
