[[Old Testament/Hosea/Hosea 13|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Joel|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, Ephraim will repent and return unto the Lord.*

**1**  O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast [[#^note-1a|fallen]] by thine iniquity. ^verse-1

**2**  Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we [[#^note-2a|render]] the [[#^note-2b|calves]] of our lips. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Asshur]] shall not [[#^note-3b|save]] us; we will not ride upon [[#^note-3c|horses]]: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the [[#^note-3d|fatherless]] findeth mercy. ^verse-3

**4**  Â¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will [[#^note-4a|love]] them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. ^verse-4

**5**  I will be as the [[#^note-5a|dew]] unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. ^verse-5

**6**  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the [[#^note-6a|olive tree]], and his smell as Lebanon. ^verse-6

**7**  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. ^verse-7

**8**  Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. ^verse-8

**9**  Who is [[#^note-9a|wise]], and he shall understand these things? [[#^note-9b|prudent]], and he shall know them? for the [[#^note-9c|ways]] of the Lord are right, and the just shall [[#^note-9d|walk]] in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein. ^verse-9
