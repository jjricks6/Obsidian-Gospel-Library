*The kingdoms of Judah and Israel will both fall because of their iniquities.*

**1**  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. ^verse-1

**2**  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. ^verse-2

**3**  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest [[#^note-3a|whoredom]], and Israel is defiled. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|They]] will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. ^verse-5

**6**  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him; he hath [[#^note-6a|withdrawn]] himself from them. ^verse-6

**7**  They have dealt treacherously against the Lord: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a [[#^note-7a|month]] devour them with their portions. ^verse-7

**8**  Blow ye the [[#^note-8a|cornet]] in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. ^verse-8

**9**  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. ^verse-9

**10**  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the [[#^note-10a|bound]]: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. ^verse-10

**11**  Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked [[#^note-11a|after the commandment]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. ^verse-12

**13**  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his [[#^note-13a|wound]], then went [[#^note-13b|Ephraim]] to the Assyrian, and sent to king [[#^note-13c|Jareb]]: yet could he not [[#^note-13d|heal]] you, nor cure you of your wound. ^verse-13

**14**  For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him. ^verse-14

**15**  Â¶ I will go and return to my place, till they [[#^note-15a|acknowledge]] their offence, and [[#^note-15b|seek]] my face: in their [[#^note-15c|affliction]] they will seek me early. ^verse-15
