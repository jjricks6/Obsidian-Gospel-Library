*Israel loses all truth, mercy, and knowledge of God and goes whoring after false gods.*

**1**  Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord hath a [[#^note-1a|controversy]] with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no [[#^note-1b|truth]], nor mercy, nor [[#^note-1c|knowledge]] of God in the land. ^verse-1

**2**  By [[#^note-2a|swearing]], and [[#^note-2b|lying]], and killing, and [[#^note-2c|stealing]], and committing adultery, they [[#^note-2d|break out]], and [[#^note-2e|blood toucheth blood]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore shall the [[#^note-3a|land]] mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. ^verse-3

**4**  Yet let no man [[#^note-4a|strive]], nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the [[#^note-5a|prophet]] also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ My people are destroyed for lack of [[#^note-6a|knowledge]]: because thou hast [[#^note-6b|rejected]] [[#^note-6c|knowledge]], I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the [[#^note-6d|law]] of thy God, I will also forget thy children. ^verse-6

**7**  As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into [[#^note-7a|shame]]. ^verse-7

**8**  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. ^verse-8

**9**  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. ^verse-9

**10**  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Whoredom]] and wine and new wine take away the heart. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ My people ask [[#^note-12a|counsel]] at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the [[#^note-12b|spirit]] of [[#^note-12c|whoredoms]] hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. ^verse-12

**13**  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit [[#^note-13a|adultery]]. ^verse-13

**14**  I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Though thou, Israel, play the [[#^note-15a|harlot]], yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to [[#^note-15b|Beth-aven]], nor swear, The Lord liveth. ^verse-15

**16**  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. ^verse-16

**17**  Ephraim is joined to [[#^note-17a|idols]]: let him alone. ^verse-17

**18**  Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [[#^note-18a|with shame do love]], Give ye. ^verse-18

**19**  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. ^verse-19
