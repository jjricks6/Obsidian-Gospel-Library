*Israel has plowed wickedness and reaped iniquityâ€”Hosea calls upon Israel to seek the Lord.*

**1**  Israel is an empty [[#^note-1a|vine]], he bringeth forth [[#^note-1b|fruit]] unto [[#^note-1c|himself]]: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the [[#^note-1d|altars]]; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images. ^verse-1

**2**  Their heart is [[#^note-2a|divided]]; now shall they be found [[#^note-2b|faulty]]: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. ^verse-2

**3**  For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord; what then should a king do to us? ^verse-3

**4**  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a [[#^note-4a|covenant]]: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. ^verse-4

**5**  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the [[#^note-5a|calves]] of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. ^verse-5

**6**  It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king [[#^note-6a|Jareb]]: Ephraim shall receive [[#^note-6b|shame]], and Israel shall be [[#^note-6c|ashamed]] of his own [[#^note-6d|counsel]]. ^verse-6

**7**  As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. ^verse-7

**8**  The high places also of [[#^note-8a|Aven]], the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the [[#^note-8b|mountains]], Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. ^verse-8

**9**  O Israel, thou hast [[#^note-9a|sinned]] from the days of [[#^note-9b|Gibeah]]: there they stood: the [[#^note-9c|battle]] in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them. ^verse-9

**10**  It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows. ^verse-10

**11**  And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods. ^verse-11

**12**  Sow to yourselves in [[#^note-12a|righteousness]], [[#^note-12b|reap]] in mercy; [[#^note-12c|break]] up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. ^verse-12

**13**  Ye have plowed [[#^note-13a|wickedness]], ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as [[#^note-14a|Shalman]] spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was [[#^note-14b|dashed]] in pieces upon her children. ^verse-14

**15**  So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off. ^verse-15
