*Israel is reproved for her many sins—Ephraim is mixed among the people.*

**1**  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. ^verse-1

**2**  And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own [[#^note-2a|doings]] have beset them about; they are before my face. ^verse-2

**3**  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. ^verse-3

**4**  They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. ^verse-4

**5**  In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. ^verse-5

**6**  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. ^verse-6

**7**  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. ^verse-7

**8**  Ephraim, he hath [[#^note-8a|mixed]] himself among the people; Ephraim is a [[#^note-8b|cake]] not turned. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Strangers]] have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. ^verse-9

**10**  And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not [[#^note-10a|return]] to the Lord their God, nor [[#^note-10b|seek]] him for all this. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. ^verse-11

**12**  When they shall go, I will spread my [[#^note-12a|net]] upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. ^verse-12

**13**  Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: [[#^note-13a|destruction]] unto them! because they [[#^note-13b|have]] transgressed against me: though I have [[#^note-13c|redeemed]] them, yet they have spoken lies against me. ^verse-13

**14**  And they have not [[#^note-14a|cried]] unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. ^verse-14

**15**  Though I have [[#^note-15a|bound]] and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. ^verse-15

**16**  They return, but not to the [[#^note-16a|most]] High: they are like a [[#^note-16b|deceitful]] bow: their princes shall [[#^note-16c|fall]] by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. ^verse-16
