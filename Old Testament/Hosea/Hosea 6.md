*Hosea calls Israel to return and serve the Lord—The mercy and knowledge of God are more important than ritualistic sacrifices.*

**1**  Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will [[#^note-1a|heal]] us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. ^verse-1

**2**  After two days will he [[#^note-2a|revive us]]: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his [[#^note-2b|sight]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the [[#^note-3a|latter and former rain]] unto the earth. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early [[#^note-4a|dew]] it goeth away. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have [[#^note-5a|slain]] them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. ^verse-5

**6**  For [[#^note-6a|I]] desired [[#^note-6b|mercy]], and not sacrifice; and the [[#^note-6c|knowledge]] of God more than burnt [[#^note-6d|offerings]]. ^verse-6

**7**  But they like [[#^note-7a|men]] have [[#^note-7b|transgressed]] the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. ^verse-7

**8**  Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood. ^verse-8

**9**  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder [[#^note-9a|in the way]] by consent: for they commit lewdness. ^verse-9

**10**  I have seen an [[#^note-10a|horrible]] thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. ^verse-10

**11**  Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people. ^verse-11
