*Ephraim's sins provoke the Lord—There is no Savior beside the Lord—He ransoms from the grave and redeems from death.*

**1**  When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he [[#^note-1a|offended]] in Baal, he died. ^verse-1

**2**  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten [[#^note-2a|images]] of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the [[#^note-3a|chaff]] that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. ^verse-3

**4**  Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no [[#^note-4a|god]] but me: for there is no [[#^note-4b|saviour]] [[#^note-4c|beside]] me. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ I did [[#^note-5a|know]] thee in the wilderness, in the land of great [[#^note-5b|drought]]. ^verse-5

**6**  According to their pasture, so were they [[#^note-6a|filled]]; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they [[#^note-6b|forgotten]] me. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them: ^verse-7

**8**  I will meet them as a [[#^note-8a|bear]] that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the [[#^note-8b|caul]] of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ O Israel, thou hast [[#^note-9a|destroyed]] thyself; but in me is thine [[#^note-9b|help]]. ^verse-9

**10**  I will be thy [[#^note-10a|king]]: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a [[#^note-10b|king]] and princes? ^verse-10

**11**  I gave thee a king in mine [[#^note-11a|anger]], and [[#^note-11b|took]] him away in my wrath. ^verse-11

**12**  The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|sorrows]] of a [[#^note-13b|travailing]] woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the [[#^note-13c|breaking]] forth of children. ^verse-13

**14**  I will [[#^note-14a|ransom]] them from the power of the [[#^note-14b|grave]]; I will [[#^note-14c|redeem]] them from [[#^note-14d|death]]: O death, I will be thy [[#^note-14e|plagues]]; O grave, I will be thy destruction: [[#^note-14f|repentance]] shall be hid from mine eyes. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east [[#^note-15a|wind]] shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Samaria]] shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be [[#^note-16b|dashed]] in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. ^verse-16
