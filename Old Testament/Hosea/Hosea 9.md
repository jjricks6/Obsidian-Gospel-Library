*The people of Israel are taken into captivity for their sinsâ€”Ephraim will be a wanderer among the nations.*

**1**  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a [[#^note-1a|whoring]] from thy God, thou hast loved a [[#^note-1b|reward]] upon every [[#^note-1c|cornfloor]]. ^verse-1

**2**  The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her. ^verse-2

**3**  They shall not dwell in the Lord's [[#^note-3a|land]]; but Ephraim shall return to [[#^note-3b|Egypt]], and they shall eat [[#^note-3c|unclean things]] in Assyria. ^verse-3

**4**  They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord? ^verse-5

**6**  For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their [[#^note-6a|tabernacles]]. ^verse-6

**7**  The days of [[#^note-7a|visitation]] are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a [[#^note-7b|fool]], the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. ^verse-7

**8**  The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. ^verse-8

**9**  They have deeply [[#^note-9a|corrupted]] themselves, as in the days of [[#^note-9b|Gibeah]]: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. ^verse-9

**10**  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the [[#^note-10a|fig tree]] at her first time: but they went to [[#^note-10b|Baal-peor]], and separated themselves unto that shame; and their [[#^note-10c|abominations]] were according as they loved. ^verse-10

**11**  As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. ^verse-11

**12**  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I [[#^note-12a|depart]] from them! ^verse-12

**13**  Ephraim, as I saw [[#^note-13a|Tyrus]], is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. ^verse-13

**14**  Give them, O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. ^verse-14

**15**  All their wickedness is in [[#^note-15a|Gilgal]]: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters. ^verse-15

**16**  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. ^verse-16

**17**  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be [[#^note-17a|wanderers]] among the nations. ^verse-17
