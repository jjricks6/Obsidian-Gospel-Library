*Both Israel and Judah have forsaken the Lord—The Lord has written the great things of His law to Ephraim.*

**1**  Set the [[#^note-1a|trumpet]] to thy mouth. He shall come as an [[#^note-1b|eagle]] against the house of the Lord, because they have [[#^note-1c|transgressed]] my covenant, and trespassed against my law. ^verse-1

**2**  Israel shall cry unto me, My [[#^note-2a|God]], we [[#^note-2b|know]] thee. ^verse-2

**3**  Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the [[#^note-3a|enemy]] shall pursue him. ^verse-3

**4**  They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and [[#^note-4a|I knew it not]]: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Thy [[#^note-5a|calf]], O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be [[#^note-5b|ere]] they attain to innocency? ^verse-5

**6**  For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. ^verse-6

**7**  For they have sown the wind, and they shall [[#^note-7a|reap]] the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. ^verse-7

**8**  Israel is [[#^note-8a|swallowed]] up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a [[#^note-8b|vessel]] wherein is no pleasure. ^verse-8

**9**  For they are gone up to [[#^note-9a|Assyria]], a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath [[#^note-9b|hired]] lovers. ^verse-9

**10**  Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. ^verse-10

**11**  Because Ephraim hath made many [[#^note-11a|altars]] to [[#^note-11b|sin]], altars shall be unto him to sin. ^verse-11

**12**  I have [[#^note-12a|written]] to him the great things of my [[#^note-12b|law]], but they were counted as a strange thing. ^verse-12

**13**  They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the Lord [[#^note-13a|accepteth]] them not; now will he [[#^note-13b|remember]] their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to [[#^note-13c|Egypt]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For Israel hath forgotten his [[#^note-14a|Maker]], and buildeth [[#^note-14b|temples]]; and Judah hath multiplied [[#^note-14c|fenced]] cities: but I will send a [[#^note-14d|fire]] upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. ^verse-14
