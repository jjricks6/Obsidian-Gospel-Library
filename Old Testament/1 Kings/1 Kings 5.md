*Solomon solicits and gains Hiram's help in getting timber to build the temple—The Israelites hew stones and cut timber for the temple.*

**1**  And [[#^note-1a|Hiram]] king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a [[#^note-1b|lover]] of David. ^verse-1

**2**  And Solomon sent to [[#^note-2a|Hiram]], saying, ^verse-2

**3**  Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an [[#^note-3a|house]] unto the name of the [[#^note-3b|Lord]] his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. ^verse-3

**4**  But now the Lord my God hath given me [[#^note-4a|rest]] on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. ^verse-4

**5**  And, behold, I purpose to build an [[#^note-5a|house]] unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. ^verse-5

**6**  Now therefore command thou that they hew me [[#^note-6a|cedar]] trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that [[#^note-6b|can skill]] to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, [[#^note-7a|Blessed]] be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. ^verse-7

**8**  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of [[#^note-8a|fir]]. ^verse-8

**9**  My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. ^verse-9

**10**  So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire. ^verse-10

**11**  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. ^verse-11

**12**  And the Lord gave Solomon [[#^note-12a|wisdom]], as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a [[#^note-12b|league]] together. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And king Solomon raised a [[#^note-13a|levy]] out of all Israel; and the [[#^note-13b|levy]] was thirty thousand men. ^verse-13

**14**  And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and [[#^note-14a|Adoniram]] was over the levy. ^verse-14

**15**  And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare [[#^note-15a|burdens]], and fourscore thousand [[#^note-15b|hewers in the mountains]]; ^verse-15

**16**  Beside the chief of Solomon's [[#^note-16a|officers]] which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which [[#^note-16b|ruled]] over the people that wrought in the work. ^verse-16

**17**  And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, [[#^note-17a|costly]] [[#^note-17b|stones]], and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. ^verse-17

**18**  And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the [[#^note-18a|stonesquarers]]: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. ^verse-18
