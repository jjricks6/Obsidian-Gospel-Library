*The officers in Solomon's court are listed—Solomon reigns in peace and prosperity over a large kingdom—His wisdom and understanding exceed that of all men.*

**1**  So king Solomon was king over all Israel. ^verse-1

**2**  And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, ^verse-2

**3**  Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, [[#^note-3a|scribes]]; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the [[#^note-3b|recorder]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|Benaiah]] the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and [[#^note-4b|Abiathar]] were the priests: ^verse-4

**5**  And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the [[#^note-5a|officers]]: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend: ^verse-5

**6**  And Ahishar was over the household: and [[#^note-6a|Adoniram]] the son of Abda was over the [[#^note-6b|tribute]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And Solomon had twelve [[#^note-7a|officers]] over all Israel, which [[#^note-7b|provided]] victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. ^verse-7

**8**  And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: ^verse-8

**9**  The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: ^verse-9

**10**  The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: ^verse-10

**11**  The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: ^verse-11

**12**  Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam: ^verse-12

**13**  The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: ^verse-13

**14**  Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim: ^verse-14

**15**  Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: ^verse-15

**16**  Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth: ^verse-16

**17**  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: ^verse-17

**18**  Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: ^verse-18

**19**  Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Judah and Israel were many, as the [[#^note-20a|sand]] which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. ^verse-20

**21**  And Solomon [[#^note-21a|reigned]] over all kingdoms from [[#^note-21b|the river]] unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And Solomon's [[#^note-22a|provision]] for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ^verse-22

**23**  Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. ^verse-23

**24**  For he had [[#^note-24a|dominion]] over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to [[#^note-24b|Azzah]], over all the kings on this side the river: and he had [[#^note-24c|peace]] on all sides round about him. ^verse-24

**25**  And Judah and Israel dwelt [[#^note-25a|safely]], every man under his [[#^note-25b|vine]] and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ And Solomon had forty [[#^note-26a|thousand]] stalls of [[#^note-26b|horses]] for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. ^verse-26

**27**  And those [[#^note-27a|officers]] provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. ^verse-27

**28**  Barley also and straw for the horses and [[#^note-28a|dromedaries]] brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And God [[#^note-29a|gave]] Solomon [[#^note-29b|wisdom]] and [[#^note-29c|understanding]] exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. ^verse-29

**30**  And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. ^verse-30

**31**  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. ^verse-31

**32**  And he spake three thousand [[#^note-32a|proverbs]]: and his [[#^note-32b|songs]] were a thousand and five. ^verse-32

**33**  And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. ^verse-33

**34**  And there came of [[#^note-34a|all]] people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. ^verse-34
