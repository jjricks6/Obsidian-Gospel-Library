[[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 22|Next Entry]]

*The Lord reveals His laws pertaining to servants, marriage, the death penalty for various offenses, the giving of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and the damage done by oxen.*

**1**  Now these are the [[#^note-1a|judgments]] which thou shalt set before them. ^verse-1

**2**  If thou buy an Hebrew [[#^note-2a|servant]], six years he shall serve: and in the [[#^note-2b|seventh]] he shall go out [[#^note-2c|free]] for nothing. ^verse-2

**3**  If he came in [[#^note-3a|by himself]], he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. ^verse-3

**4**  If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. ^verse-4

**5**  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: ^verse-5

**6**  Then his master shall bring him [[#^note-6a|unto]] the [[#^note-6b|judges]]; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his [[#^note-6c|ear]] through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. ^verse-7

**8**  If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. ^verse-8

**9**  And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. ^verse-9

**10**  If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her [[#^note-10a|duty of marriage]], shall he not diminish. ^verse-10

**11**  And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ He that [[#^note-12a|smiteth]] a man, so that he die, shall be surely [[#^note-12b|put to death]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a [[#^note-13a|place]] whither he shall [[#^note-13b|flee]]. ^verse-13

**14**  But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to [[#^note-14a|slay]] him with [[#^note-14b|guile]]; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to [[#^note-15a|death]]. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And he that [[#^note-16a|stealeth]] a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And he that [[#^note-17a|curseth]] his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but [[#^note-18a|keepeth his bed]]: ^verse-18

**19**  If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his [[#^note-19a|time]], and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be [[#^note-20a|surely punished]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Notwithstanding, if he [[#^note-21a|continue]] a day or two, he shall not be [[#^note-21b|punished]]: for he is his money. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ If men strive, and hurt a woman with [[#^note-22a|child]], so that [[#^note-22b|her]] fruit depart from her, and yet no [[#^note-22c|mischief]] follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. ^verse-22

**23**  And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Eye]] for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, ^verse-24

**25**  Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. ^verse-26

**27**  And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they [[#^note-28a|die]]: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be [[#^note-28b|quit]]. ^verse-28

**29**  But if the ox were [[#^note-29a|wont]] to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to [[#^note-29b|death]]. ^verse-29

**30**  If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. ^verse-30

**31**  Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. ^verse-31

**32**  If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master [[#^note-32a|thirty]] shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; ^verse-33

**34**  The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. ^verse-34

**35**  ¶ And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide. ^verse-35

**36**  Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own. ^verse-36
