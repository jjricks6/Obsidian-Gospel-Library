*The Lord appears to Moses at the burning bush—Moses is called to deliver Israel from bondage—The Lord identifies Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and as the Great I Am—He promises to smite Egypt and bring His people out with great wealth.*

**1**    Now Moses kept the flock of [[#^note-1a|Jethro]] his father in law, the [[#^note-1b|priest]] of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the [[#^note-1c|mountain of God]], even to [[#^note-1d|Horeb]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|angel of the Lord]] appeared unto him in a flame of [[#^note-2b|fire]] out of the midst of a [[#^note-2c|bush]]: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. ^verse-2

**3**  And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. ^verse-3

**4**  And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God [[#^note-4a|called]] unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. ^verse-4

**5**  And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy [[#^note-5a|shoes]] from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is [[#^note-5b|holy]] ground. ^verse-5

**6**  Moreover he said, [[#^note-6a|I am]] the [[#^note-6b|God]] of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was [[#^note-6c|afraid]] to [[#^note-6d|look]] upon God. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And the Lord said, I have surely seen the [[#^note-7a|affliction]] of my people which are in [[#^note-7b|Egypt]], and have heard their [[#^note-7c|cry]] by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; ^verse-7

**8**  And I am come [[#^note-8a|down]] to [[#^note-8b|deliver]] them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land [[#^note-8c|flowing]] with milk and honey; unto the place of the [[#^note-8d|Canaanites]], and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. ^verse-8

**9**  Now therefore, behold, the [[#^note-9a|cry]] of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. ^verse-9

**10**  Come now therefore, and I will [[#^note-10a|send]] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest [[#^note-10b|bring forth]] my people the [[#^note-10c|children of Israel]] [[#^note-10d|out]] of Egypt. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And Moses said unto God, [[#^note-11a|Who]] am I, that I should go unto [[#^note-11b|Pharaoh]], and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? ^verse-11

**12**  And he said, Certainly I will be [[#^note-12a|with thee]]; and this shall be [[#^note-12b|a token]] unto thee, that I have [[#^note-12c|sent]] thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this [[#^note-12d|mountain]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? [[#^note-13a|what]] shall I say unto them? ^verse-13

**14**  And God said unto Moses, [[#^note-14a|I Am That I Am]]: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you. ^verse-14

**15**  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The [[#^note-15a|Lord God]] of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my [[#^note-15b|name]] for ever, and [[#^note-15c|this]] is my [[#^note-15d|memorial]] unto all generations. ^verse-15

**16**  Go, and gather the [[#^note-16a|elders]] of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely [[#^note-16b|visited]] you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: ^verse-16

**17**  And I have said, I will bring you up out of the [[#^note-17a|affliction]] of [[#^note-17b|Egypt]] unto the land of the [[#^note-17c|Canaanites]], and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the [[#^note-17d|Jebusites]], unto a [[#^note-17e|land]] flowing with milk and honey. ^verse-17

**18**  And they shall [[#^note-18a|hearken]] to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord [[#^note-18b|God]] of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now [[#^note-18c|let]] us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may [[#^note-18d|sacrifice]] to the Lord our God. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And [[#^note-19a|I am sure]] that the king of Egypt will [[#^note-19b|no]]t let you go, no, not by a [[#^note-19c|mighty]] hand. ^verse-19

**20**  And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my [[#^note-20a|wonders]] which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you [[#^note-20b|go]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go [[#^note-21a|empty]]: ^verse-21

**22**  But every woman shall [[#^note-22a|borrow]] of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall [[#^note-22b|spoil]] the Egyptians. ^verse-22
