*The children of Israel sing the song of Moses—They extol the Lord as a man of war and rejoice in their deliverance from Egypt—The waters of Marah are healed—The Lord promises to free Israel from the diseases of Egypt.*

**1**  Then [[#^note-1a|sang]] Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will [[#^note-1b|sing]] unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|Lord]] is my [[#^note-2b|strength]] and song, and he is become my [[#^note-2c|salvation]]: he is my God, and I will [[#^note-2d|prepare him an habitation]]; my father's God, and I will [[#^note-2e|exalt]] him. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord is a man of [[#^note-3a|war]]: the Lord is his [[#^note-3b|name]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Pharaoh's [[#^note-4a|chariots]] and his host hath he [[#^note-4b|cast]] into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the [[#^note-4c|Red sea]]. ^verse-4

**5**  The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a [[#^note-5a|stone]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Thy [[#^note-6a|right]] [[#^note-6b|hand]], O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. ^verse-6

**7**  And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as [[#^note-7a|stubble]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And with the blast of thy nostrils the [[#^note-8a|waters]] were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an [[#^note-8b|heap]], and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. ^verse-8

**9**  The enemy said, I will [[#^note-9a|pursue]], I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my [[#^note-9b|lust]] shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. ^verse-10

**11**  Who is [[#^note-11a|like]] unto thee, O [[#^note-11b|Lord]], among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in [[#^note-11c|holiness]], [[#^note-11d|fearful in praises]], doing wonders? ^verse-11

**12**  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou in thy mercy hast [[#^note-13a|led]] forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. ^verse-13

**14**  The people shall [[#^note-14a|hear]], and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of [[#^note-14b|Palestina]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Then the [[#^note-15a|dukes]] of [[#^note-15b|Edom]] shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall [[#^note-15c|melt]] away. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Fear]] and [[#^note-16b|dread]] shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou hast [[#^note-16c|purchased]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the [[#^note-17a|Sanctuary]], O Lord, which thy hands have established. ^verse-17

**18**  The [[#^note-18a|Lord]] shall reign for ever and ever. ^verse-18

**19**  For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And [[#^note-20a|Miriam]] the [[#^note-20b|prophetess]], the [[#^note-20c|sister]] of Aaron, took a [[#^note-20d|timbrel]] in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. ^verse-20

**21**  And Miriam answered them, [[#^note-21a|Sing]] ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. ^verse-21

**22**  So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of [[#^note-22a|Shur]]; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And when they came to [[#^note-23a|Marah]], they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. ^verse-23

**24**  And the people [[#^note-24a|murmured]] against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? ^verse-24

**25**  And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the [[#^note-25a|waters]], the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he [[#^note-25b|proved]] them, ^verse-25

**26**  And said, If thou wilt [[#^note-26a|diligently]] [[#^note-26b|hearken]] to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and [[#^note-26c|keep]] all his statutes, I will put none of these [[#^note-26d|diseases]] upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that [[#^note-26e|healeth]] thee. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and [[#^note-27a|threescore and ten]] palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. ^verse-27
