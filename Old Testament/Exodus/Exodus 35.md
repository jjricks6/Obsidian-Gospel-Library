*Israel is admonished to observe the Sabbath—Free gifts are offered for the tabernacle—The calls and inspiration of certain artisans are confirmed.*

**1**  And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Six]] days shall [[#^note-2b|work]] be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a [[#^note-2c|sabbath]] of rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to [[#^note-2d|death]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Ye shall [[#^note-3a|kindle]] no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord [[#^note-4a|commanded]], saying, ^verse-4

**5**  Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: whosoever is of a [[#^note-5a|willing]] heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, and silver, and brass, ^verse-5

**6**  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, ^verse-6

**7**  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and [[#^note-7a|shittim]] wood, ^verse-7

**8**  And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, ^verse-8

**9**  And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the [[#^note-9a|ephod]], and for the breastplate. ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|every wise hearted]] among you shall come, and make all that the Lord hath commanded; ^verse-10

**11**  The [[#^note-11a|tabernacle]], his tent, and his covering, [[#^note-11b|his taches]], and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, ^verse-11

**12**  The [[#^note-12a|ark]], and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering, ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|table]], and his staves, and all [[#^note-13b|his vessels]], and the [[#^note-13c|shewbread]], ^verse-13

**14**  The [[#^note-14a|candlestick]] also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the [[#^note-14b|oil]] for the light, ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|incense]] altar, and his staves, and the [[#^note-15b|anointing oil]], and the sweet incense, and the [[#^note-15c|hanging]] for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle, ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|altar]] of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and [[#^note-16b|his foot]], ^verse-16

**17**  The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, ^verse-17

**18**  The [[#^note-18a|pins]] of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, ^verse-18

**19**  The [[#^note-19a|cloths of service]], to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. ^verse-20

**21**  And they came, every one whose [[#^note-21a|heart]] stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made [[#^note-21b|willing]], and they brought the Lord's [[#^note-21c|offering]] [[#^note-21d|to]] the work of the [[#^note-21e|tabernacle of the congregation]], and for all his service, and for the holy garments. ^verse-21

**22**  And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought [[#^note-22a|bracelets]], and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all [[#^note-22b|jewels of gold]]: and every man that offered offered an [[#^note-22c|offering]] of gold unto the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine [[#^note-23a|linen]], and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. ^verse-23

**24**  Every one that did offer an [[#^note-24a|offering]] of silver and brass brought the Lord's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. ^verse-24

**25**  And all the women that were [[#^note-25a|wise]] hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. ^verse-25

**26**  And all the women whose heart stirred them up [[#^note-26a|in wisdom]] spun goats' hair. ^verse-26

**27**  And the [[#^note-27a|rulers]] brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; ^verse-27

**28**  And [[#^note-28a|spice]], and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. ^verse-28

**29**  The children of Israel brought a [[#^note-29a|willing]] offering unto the Lord, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. ^verse-29

**30**  ¶ And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name [[#^note-30a|Bezaleel]] the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; ^verse-30

**31**  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in [[#^note-31a|wisdom]], in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of [[#^note-31b|workmanship]]; ^verse-31

**32**  And to devise [[#^note-32a|curious works]], to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, ^verse-32

**33**  And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to [[#^note-33a|make]] any manner of cunning work. ^verse-33

**34**  And he hath put in his heart that he may [[#^note-34a|teach]], both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. ^verse-34

**35**  Them hath he filled with [[#^note-35a|wisdom]] of heart, to [[#^note-35b|work]] all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the [[#^note-35c|cunning workman]], and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work. ^verse-35
