*Israel is commanded to donate property and build a tabernacle, the ark of testimony (with the mercy seat and cherubims), a table (for the shewbread), and the candlestick, all according to patterns shown to Moses on the mount.*

**1**  And the Lord [[#^note-1a|spake]] unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Speak]] unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it [[#^note-2b|willingly]] with his heart ye shall take my offering. ^verse-2

**3**  And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|blue]], and purple, and scarlet, and fine [[#^note-4b|linen]], and goats' hair, ^verse-4

**5**  And [[#^note-5a|rams']] skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and [[#^note-5b|shittim]] wood, ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Oil]] for the light, [[#^note-6b|spices]] for [[#^note-6c|anointing oil]], and for sweet [[#^note-6d|incense]], ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Onyx stones]], and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the [[#^note-7b|breastplate]]. ^verse-7

**8**    And let them make me a [[#^note-8a|sanctuary]]; that I may [[#^note-8b|dwell]] among them. ^verse-8

**9**  According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the [[#^note-9a|tabernacle]], and the pattern of all the [[#^note-9b|instruments]] thereof, even so shall ye make it. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And they shall make an [[#^note-10a|ark]] of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. ^verse-10

**11**  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. ^verse-11

**12**  And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. ^verse-12

**13**  And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. ^verse-13

**14**  And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the [[#^note-14a|ark]], that the ark may be borne with them. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|staves]] shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. ^verse-15

**16**  And thou shalt put into the ark the [[#^note-16a|testimony]] which I shall give thee. ^verse-16

**17**  And thou shalt make a [[#^note-17a|mercy seat]] of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. ^verse-17

**18**  And thou shalt [[#^note-18a|make]] two [[#^note-18b|cherubims]] of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. ^verse-18

**19**  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even [[#^note-19a|of the mercy seat]] shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. ^verse-19

**20**  And the cherubims shall stretch forth [[#^note-20a|their]] wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. ^verse-20

**21**  And thou shalt put the [[#^note-21a|mercy seat]] above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the [[#^note-21b|testimony]] that I shall give thee. ^verse-21

**22**  And there I will [[#^note-22a|meet]] with thee, and I will [[#^note-22b|commune]] with thee from above the [[#^note-22c|mercy seat]], from between the two [[#^note-22d|cherubims]] which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Thou shalt also make a [[#^note-23a|table]] of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. ^verse-23

**24**  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. ^verse-24

**25**  And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. ^verse-25

**26**  And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. ^verse-26

**27**  Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table. ^verse-27

**28**  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. ^verse-28

**29**  And thou shalt make the [[#^note-29a|dishes]] thereof, and spoons thereof, and [[#^note-29b|covers]] thereof, and bowls thereof, [[#^note-29c|to cover withal]]: of pure gold shalt thou make them. ^verse-29

**30**  And thou shalt set upon the table [[#^note-30a|shewbread]] before me alway. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ And thou shalt make a [[#^note-31a|candlestick]] of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of [[#^note-31b|the same]]. ^verse-31

**32**  And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side: ^verse-32

**33**  Three bowls m[[#^note-33a|a]]de like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: [[#^note-33b|so in the]] six branches that come out of the candlestick. ^verse-33

**34**  And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. ^verse-34

**35**  And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick. ^verse-35

**36**  Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold. ^verse-36

**37**  And thou shalt make the seven [[#^note-37a|lamps]] thereof: and they shall [[#^note-37b|light]] the [[#^note-37c|lamps]] thereof, that they may give light over against it. ^verse-37

**38**  And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. ^verse-38

**39**  Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. ^verse-39

**40**  And look that thou make them after their [[#^note-40a|pattern]], which was shewed thee in the mount. ^verse-40
