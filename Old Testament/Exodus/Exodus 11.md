*The departing Israelites are authorized to ask for jewels and gold from their neighbors—The Lord promises to slay the firstborn in every Egyptian home—He puts a difference between the Egyptians and the Israelites.*

**1**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely [[#^note-1a|thrust]] you out hence altogether. ^verse-1

**2**  Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man [[#^note-2a|borrow]] of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, [[#^note-2b|jewels]] of silver, and jewels of gold. ^verse-2

**3**  And the Lord gave the people [[#^note-3a|favour]] in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. ^verse-3

**4**  And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: ^verse-4

**5**  And all the [[#^note-5a|firstborn]] in the land of Egypt shall die, from the [[#^note-5b|firstborn]] of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. ^verse-5

**6**  And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. ^verse-6

**7**  But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a [[#^note-7a|difference]] between the Egyptians and Israel. ^verse-7

**8**  And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great [[#^note-8a|anger]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. ^verse-9

**10**  And Moses [[#^note-10a|and]] Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. ^verse-10
