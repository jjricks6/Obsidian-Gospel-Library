*Israel accepts the word of the Lord by covenant—Moses sprinkles the blood of the covenant—He, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel see God—The Lord calls Moses on to the mount to receive the tables of stone and commandments.*

**1**  And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, [[#^note-1a|Nadab]], and Abihu, and [[#^note-1b|seventy]] of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. ^verse-1

**2**  And Moses alone shall come near the Lord: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the [[#^note-3a|judgments]]: and all the people answered with one [[#^note-3b|voice]], and said, All the words which the Lord hath said will we do. ^verse-3

**4**  And Moses [[#^note-4a|wrote]] all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an [[#^note-4b|altar]] [[#^note-4c|under the hill]], and twelve [[#^note-4d|pillars]], according to the twelve tribes of Israel. ^verse-4

**5**  And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed [[#^note-5a|peace offerings]] of oxen unto the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  And Moses took half of the [[#^note-6a|blood]], and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. ^verse-6

**7**  And he took the book of the [[#^note-7a|covenant]], and [[#^note-7b|read]] in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be [[#^note-7c|obedient]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And Moses took the [[#^note-8a|blood]], and [[#^note-8b|sprinkled]] it on the people, and said, Behold the [[#^note-8c|blood]] of the [[#^note-8d|covenant]], which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and [[#^note-9a|seventy]] of the [[#^note-9b|elders]] of Israel: ^verse-9

**10**  And they [[#^note-10a|saw]] the God of Israel: and there was under his [[#^note-10b|feet]] as [[#^note-10c|it]] were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. ^verse-10

**11**  And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they [[#^note-11a|saw]] God, and did eat and drink. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee [[#^note-12a|tables]] of stone, and a [[#^note-12b|law]], and commandments which I have [[#^note-12c|written]]; that thou mayest teach them. ^verse-12

**13**  And Moses rose up, and his minister [[#^note-13a|Joshua]]: and Moses went up into the [[#^note-13b|mount of God]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. ^verse-14

**15**  And Moses went up into the mount, and a [[#^note-15a|cloud]] covered the mount. ^verse-15

**16**  And the [[#^note-16a|glory]] of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. ^verse-16

**17**  And the [[#^note-17a|sight]] of the [[#^note-17b|glory]] of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. ^verse-17

**18**  And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount [[#^note-18a|forty]] days and forty nights. ^verse-18
