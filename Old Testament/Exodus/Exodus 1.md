[[Old Testament/Exodus|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 2|Next Entry]]

*The children of Israel multiply—They are placed in bondage by the Egyptians—Pharaoh seeks to destroy the sons born to Hebrew women.*

**1**  Now these are the [[#^note-1a|names]] of the [[#^note-1b|children of Israel]], which came [[#^note-1c|into]] [[#^note-1d|Egypt]]; every man and his household came with Jacob. ^verse-1

**2**  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, ^verse-2

**3**  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, ^verse-3

**4**  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. ^verse-4

**5**  And all the souls that came out of the loins of [[#^note-5a|Jacob]] were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. ^verse-5

**6**  And [[#^note-6a|Joseph]] died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And the children of Israel were [[#^note-7a|fruitful]], and [[#^note-7b|increased]] abundantly, and multiplied, and [[#^note-7c|waxed]] exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. ^verse-7

**8**  Now there arose up a new [[#^note-8a|king]] over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. ^verse-8

**9**  And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are [[#^note-9a|more]] and [[#^note-9b|mightier]] than we: ^verse-9

**10**  Come on, let us deal [[#^note-10a|wisely]] with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there [[#^note-10b|falleth out]] any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore they did set over them [[#^note-11a|taskmasters]] to afflict them with their [[#^note-11b|burdens]]. And they built for Pharaoh [[#^note-11c|treasure cities]], Pithom and [[#^note-11d|Raamses]]. ^verse-11

**12**  But the more they afflicted them, the more they [[#^note-12a|multiplied]] and grew. And they were [[#^note-12b|grieved because of]] the children of Israel. ^verse-12

**13**  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: ^verse-13

**14**  And they made their lives bitter with hard [[#^note-14a|bondage]], in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: ^verse-15

**16**  And he said, When ye [[#^note-16a|do the office of]] a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the [[#^note-16b|stools]]; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. ^verse-16

**17**  But the midwives [[#^note-17a|feared]] God, and did not as the king of Egypt [[#^note-17b|commanded]] them, but saved the men children alive. ^verse-17

**18**  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? ^verse-18

**19**  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are [[#^note-19a|delivered]] ere the midwives come in unto them. ^verse-19

**20**  Therefore God dealt [[#^note-20a|well]] with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. ^verse-20

**21**  And it came to pass, because the midwives [[#^note-21a|feared God]], that he made them [[#^note-21b|houses]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is [[#^note-22a|born]] ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. ^verse-22
