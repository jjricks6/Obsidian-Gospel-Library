*Bezaleel makes the ark, the mercy seat, and the cherubims—He makes the table, the vessels, the candlestick, the incense altar, the holy anointing oil, and the sweet incense.*

**1**  And Bezaleel [[#^note-1a|made]] the [[#^note-1b|ark]] of [[#^note-1c|shittim]] wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: ^verse-1

**2**  And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a [[#^note-2a|crown]] of gold to it round about. ^verse-2

**3**  And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. ^verse-3

**4**  And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. ^verse-4

**5**  And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And he made the [[#^note-6a|mercy seat]] of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. ^verse-6

**7**  And he made two [[#^note-7a|cherubims]] of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; ^verse-7

**8**  One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: [[#^note-8a|out of]] the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. ^verse-8

**9**  And the [[#^note-9a|cherubims]] spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And he made the [[#^note-10a|table]] of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof: ^verse-10

**11**  And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about. ^verse-11

**12**  Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. ^verse-12

**13**  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Over against]] the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. ^verse-14

**15**  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. ^verse-15

**16**  And he made the [[#^note-16a|vessels]] which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and [[#^note-16b|his covers]] to cover withal, of pure gold. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And he made the [[#^note-17a|candlestick]] of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; [[#^note-17b|his]] shaft, and his branch, his bowls, [[#^note-17c|his knops]], and his flowers, were of the same: ^verse-17

**18**  And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: ^verse-18

**19**  Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. ^verse-19

**20**  And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: ^verse-20

**21**  And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it. ^verse-21

**22**  Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold. ^verse-22

**23**  And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold. ^verse-23

**24**  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And he made the incense [[#^note-25a|altar]] of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same. ^verse-25

**26**  And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about. ^verse-26

**27**  And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves [[#^note-27a|to bear it withal]]. ^verse-27

**28**  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure [[#^note-29a|incense]] of sweet spices, according to the work of the [[#^note-29b|apothecary]]. ^verse-29
