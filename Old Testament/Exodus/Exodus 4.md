*The Lord gives signs to Moses—Aaron is chosen as a spokesman—Israel is the Lord's firstborn and must be released to serve Him—Moses' son is circumcised—Moses and Aaron lead Israel in worship.*

**1**    And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not [[#^note-1a|believe]] me, nor [[#^note-1b|hearken]] unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. ^verse-3

**4**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: ^verse-4

**5**  That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was [[#^note-6a|leprous]] as snow. ^verse-6

**7**  And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and [[#^note-7a|plucked]] it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was [[#^note-7b|turned again as]] his other flesh. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first [[#^note-8a|sign]], that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of [[#^note-9a|the river]], and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become [[#^note-9b|blood]] upon the dry land. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of [[#^note-10a|speech]], and of a [[#^note-10b|slow]] tongue. ^verse-10

**11**  And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who [[#^note-11a|maketh]] the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord? ^verse-11

**12**  Now therefore go, and I will be with thy [[#^note-12a|mouth]], and [[#^note-12b|teach]] thee what thou shalt [[#^note-12c|say]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, [[#^note-13a|by]] the hand of him whom thou wilt send. ^verse-13

**14**  And the [[#^note-14a|anger]] of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. ^verse-14

**15**  And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his [[#^note-15a|mouth]]: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will [[#^note-15b|teach]] you what ye shall do. ^verse-15

**16**  And he shall be thy [[#^note-16a|spokesman]] unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee [[#^note-16b|instead]] of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of [[#^note-16c|God]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And thou shalt take this [[#^note-17a|rod]] in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And Moses went and returned to [[#^note-18a|Jethro]] his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. ^verse-18

**19**  And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are [[#^note-19a|dead]] which sought thy [[#^note-19b|life]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the [[#^note-20a|rod]] of God in his hand. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those [[#^note-21a|wonders]] before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine [[#^note-21b|hand]]: [[#^note-21c|but]] I will [[#^note-21d|harden]] his heart, that he shall not let the people go. ^verse-21

**22**  And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, [[#^note-22a|Israel]] is my [[#^note-22b|son]], even my [[#^note-22c|firstborn]]: ^verse-22

**23**  And I say unto thee, Let my [[#^note-23a|son]] go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ [[#^note-24a|And]] it came to pass [[#^note-24b|by]] the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to [[#^note-24c|kill]] him. ^verse-24

**25**  Then Zipporah took a [[#^note-25a|sharp stone]], and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a [[#^note-25b|bloody husband]] art thou to me. ^verse-25

**26**  So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the [[#^note-26a|circumcision]]. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the [[#^note-27a|mount of God]], and kissed him. ^verse-27

**28**  And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the [[#^note-29a|elders]] of the children of Israel: ^verse-29

**30**  And Aaron [[#^note-30a|spake]] all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. ^verse-30

**31**  And the people [[#^note-31a|believed]]: and when they heard that the Lord had [[#^note-31b|visited]] the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their [[#^note-31c|affliction]], then they [[#^note-31d|bowed]] their heads and worshipped. ^verse-31
