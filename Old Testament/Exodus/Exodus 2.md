*Moses is born to Levite parents, is raised by Pharaoh's daughter, slays an Egyptian in defense of an Israelite, flees to Midian, and marries Zipporah—Israel in bondage cries to the Lord.*

**1**  And there went a man of the house of [[#^note-1a|Levi]], and took to wife a daughter of Levi. ^verse-1

**2**  And the woman conceived, and bare a [[#^note-2a|son]]: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him [[#^note-2b|three]] months. ^verse-2

**3**  And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it [[#^note-3a|in the flags]] by the river's brink. ^verse-3

**4**  And his [[#^note-4a|sister]] stood afar off, [[#^note-4b|to wit]] what would be done to him. ^verse-4

**5**    ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. ^verse-5

**6**  And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? ^verse-7

**8**  And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. ^verse-8

**9**  And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. ^verse-9

**10**  And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her [[#^note-10a|son]]. And she called his name [[#^note-10b|Moses]]: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his [[#^note-11a|brethren]], and looked on their [[#^note-11b|burdens]]: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. ^verse-11

**12**  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he [[#^note-12a|slew]] the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. ^verse-12

**13**  And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore [[#^note-13a|smitest]] thou thy fellow? ^verse-13

**14**  And he said, Who made thee a [[#^note-14a|prince]] and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. ^verse-14

**15**  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to [[#^note-15a|slay]] Moses. But Moses [[#^note-15b|fled]] from [[#^note-15c|the face of]] Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. ^verse-15

**16**  Now the priest of [[#^note-16a|Midian]] had seven daughters: and they came and drew [[#^note-16b|water]], and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. ^verse-16

**17**  And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. ^verse-17

**18**  And when they came to [[#^note-18a|Reuel]] their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? ^verse-18

**19**  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. ^verse-19

**20**  And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. ^verse-20

**21**  And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses [[#^note-21a|Zipporah]] his daughter. ^verse-21

**22**  And she bare him a [[#^note-22a|son]], and he called his name [[#^note-22b|Gershom]]: for he said, I have been a [[#^note-22c|stranger]] in a strange land. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt [[#^note-23a|died]]: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they [[#^note-23b|cried]], and their [[#^note-23c|cry]] came up unto God by reason of the bondage. ^verse-23

**24**  And God [[#^note-24a|heard]] their groaning, and God remembered his [[#^note-24b|covenant]] with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. ^verse-24

**25**  And God looked upon the children of Israel, [[#^note-25a|and]] God had respect unto them. ^verse-25
