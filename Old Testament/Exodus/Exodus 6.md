*The Lord identifies Himself as Jehovah—The genealogies of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi are listed.*

**1**  Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for [[#^note-1a|with a strong hand]] shall he let them go, and with a [[#^note-1b|strong]] hand shall he [[#^note-1c|drive]] them out of his land. ^verse-1

**2**  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: ^verse-2

**3**  And I [[#^note-3a|appeared]] unto [[#^note-3b|Abraham]], unto Isaac, [[#^note-3c|and]] unto Jacob, by the [[#^note-3d|name]] of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them. ^verse-3

**4**  And I have also established my [[#^note-4a|covenant]] with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their [[#^note-4b|pilgrimage]], wherein they were [[#^note-4c|strangers]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And I have also [[#^note-5a|heard]] the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in [[#^note-5b|bondage]]; and I have remembered my covenant. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will [[#^note-6a|bring]] you out from under the [[#^note-6b|burdens]] of the Egyptians, and I will [[#^note-6c|rid]] you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: ^verse-6

**7**  And I will take you to me for a [[#^note-7a|people]], and I will be to you a [[#^note-7b|God]]: and ye shall [[#^note-7c|know]] that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. ^verse-7

**8**  And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did [[#^note-8a|swear]] to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for [[#^note-9a|cruel]] bondage. ^verse-9

**10**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-10

**11**  Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. ^verse-11

**12**  And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am [[#^note-12a|of uncircumcised lips]]? ^verse-12

**13**  And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a [[#^note-13a|charge]] unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-13

**19**  And the sons of [[#^note-19a|Merari]]; Mahali and Mushi: these are the [[#^note-19b|families]] of Levi according to their generations. ^verse-19

**20**  And [[#^note-20a|Amram]] took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him [[#^note-20b|Aaron]] and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. ^verse-21

**22**  And the sons of [[#^note-22a|Uzziel]]; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. ^verse-22

**23**  And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him [[#^note-23a|Nadab]], and Abihu, Eleazar, and [[#^note-23b|Ithamar]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites. ^verse-24

**25**  And [[#^note-25a|Eleazar]] Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. ^verse-25

**26**  These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. ^verse-26

**27**  These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, ^verse-28

**29**  That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. ^verse-29

**30**  And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am [[#^note-30a|of uncircumcised lips]], and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? ^verse-30
