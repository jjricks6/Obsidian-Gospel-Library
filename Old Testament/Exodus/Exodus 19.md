*The Lord covenants to make Israel a peculiar treasure, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation—The people sanctify themselves—The Lord appears on Sinai amid fire, smoke, and earthquakes.*

**1**  In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the [[#^note-1a|wilderness]] of Sinai. ^verse-1

**2**  For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had [[#^note-2a|pitched]] in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. ^verse-2

**3**  And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord [[#^note-3a|called]] unto him out of the [[#^note-3b|mountain]], saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; ^verse-3

**4**  Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on [[#^note-4a|eagles']] wings, and brought you unto myself. ^verse-4

**5**  Now therefore, if ye will [[#^note-5a|obey]] my voice indeed, and keep my [[#^note-5b|covenant]], then ye shall be a [[#^note-5c|peculiar]] [[#^note-5d|treasure]] unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: ^verse-5

**6**  And ye shall be unto me a [[#^note-6a|kingdom]] of [[#^note-6b|priests]], and an [[#^note-6c|holy]] [[#^note-6d|nation]]. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord [[#^note-7a|commanded]] him. ^verse-7

**8**  And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will [[#^note-8a|do]]. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick [[#^note-9a|cloud]], that the people may [[#^note-9b|hear]] when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and [[#^note-10a|sanctify]] them to day and to morrow, and let them [[#^note-10b|wash]] their clothes, ^verse-10

**11**  And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in the [[#^note-11a|sight]] of all the people upon mount Sinai. ^verse-11

**12**  And thou shalt set [[#^note-12a|bounds]] unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the [[#^note-12b|mount]], or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: ^verse-12

**13**  There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. ^verse-14

**15**  And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: [[#^note-15a|come]] not at your wives. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. ^verse-16

**17**  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to [[#^note-17a|meet]] with God; and they stood at the [[#^note-17b|nether part of]] the mount. ^verse-17

**18**  And mount [[#^note-18a|Sinai]] was [[#^note-18b|altogether]] on a [[#^note-18c|smoke]], because the Lord [[#^note-18d|descended]] upon it in [[#^note-18e|fire]]: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole [[#^note-18f|mount]] quaked greatly. ^verse-18

**19**  And when the voice of the [[#^note-19a|trumpet]] sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a [[#^note-19b|voice]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the [[#^note-20a|top]] of the mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to [[#^note-21a|gaze]], and many of them [[#^note-21b|perish]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them. ^verse-22

**23**  And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. ^verse-23

**24**  And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them. ^verse-24

**25**  So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. ^verse-25
