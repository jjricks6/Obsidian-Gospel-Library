*Israel goes out of Egypt—Israel passes through the Red Sea on dry ground—The Lord overthrows the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they [[#^note-2a|turn]] and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between [[#^note-2b|Migdol]] and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. ^verse-2

**3**  For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|And]] I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured [[#^note-4b|upon]] Pharaoh, and upon all his [[#^note-4c|host]]; that the Egyptians may [[#^note-4d|know]] that I am the Lord. And they did so. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? ^verse-5

**6**  And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: ^verse-6

**7**  And he took six hundred chosen [[#^note-7a|chariots]], and [[#^note-7b|all the chariots]] of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|And]] the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out [[#^note-8b|with]] an [[#^note-8c|high]] hand. ^verse-8

**9**  But the Egyptians [[#^note-9a|pursued]] after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside [[#^note-9b|Pi-hahiroth]], before Baal-zephon. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to [[#^note-11a|die]] in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou [[#^note-11b|dealt]] thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? ^verse-11

**12**  Is not this the [[#^note-12a|word]] that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may [[#^note-12b|serve]] the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will [[#^note-13a|shew to you]] to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. ^verse-13

**14**  The Lord shall [[#^note-14a|fight]] for you, and ye shall hold your [[#^note-14b|peace]]. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: ^verse-15

**16**  But lift thou up thy [[#^note-16a|rod]], and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and [[#^note-16b|divide]] it: and the children of Israel shall go on [[#^note-16c|dry]] ground through the midst of the sea. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|And]] I, behold, I will [[#^note-17b|harden]] the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and [[#^note-17c|I]] will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. ^verse-17

**18**  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And the [[#^note-19a|angel]] of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the [[#^note-19b|pillar]] of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: ^verse-19

**20**  And it came between the camp of the Egyptians [[#^note-20a|and]] the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and [[#^note-20b|darkness]] to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. ^verse-20

**21**  And Moses stretched out his hand over the [[#^note-21a|sea]]; and the Lord [[#^note-21b|caused]] the [[#^note-21c|sea]] to [[#^note-21d|go back]] by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea [[#^note-21e|dry]] land, and the [[#^note-21f|waters]] were [[#^note-21g|divided]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. ^verse-23

**24**  And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, ^verse-24

**25**  And [[#^note-25a|took]] off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine [[#^note-26a|hand]] over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. ^verse-26

**27**  And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to [[#^note-27a|his strength]] when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled [[#^note-27b|against it]]; and the Lord overthrew the [[#^note-27c|Egyptians]] in the midst of the sea. ^verse-27

**28**  And the [[#^note-28a|waters]] returned, and [[#^note-28b|covered]] the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the [[#^note-28c|sea]] after them; there remained not so much as [[#^note-28d|one]] of them. ^verse-28

**29**  But the children of Israel walked upon [[#^note-29a|dry]] land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. ^verse-29

**30**  Thus the Lord [[#^note-30a|saved]] Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. ^verse-30

**31**  And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and [[#^note-31a|believed]] the Lord, and his servant Moses. ^verse-31
