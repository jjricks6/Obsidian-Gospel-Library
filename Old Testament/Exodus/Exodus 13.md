*The firstborn of man and of beasts are to be sanctified unto the Lord—The Feast of Unleavened Bread is to be kept in the land of Canaan—Moses takes Joseph's bones out of Egypt—The Lord attends Israel in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Sanctify]] unto me all the [[#^note-2b|firstborn]], whatsoever [[#^note-2c|openeth]] the [[#^note-2d|womb]] among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from [[#^note-3a|Egypt]], out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. ^verse-3

**4**  This day [[#^note-4a|came ye out]] in [[#^note-4b|the]] month [[#^note-4c|Abib]]. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And it shall be when the Lord shall [[#^note-5a|bring]] thee into the land of the [[#^note-5b|Canaanites]], and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he [[#^note-5c|sware]] unto thy fathers to give thee, a land [[#^note-5d|flowing]] with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. ^verse-5

**6**  Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  Un[[#^note-7a|leavened]] bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no [[#^note-7b|leaven]]ed bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee [[#^note-7c|in all thy quarters]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And thou shalt [[#^note-8a|shew]] thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall be for a [[#^note-9a|sign]] unto thee upon thine hand, and for a [[#^note-9b|memorial]] between thine eyes, that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance [[#^note-10a|in his season]] from year to year. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the [[#^note-11a|Canaanites]], as he [[#^note-11b|sware]] unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, ^verse-11

**12**  That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord [[#^note-12a|all]] that openeth the matrix, and every [[#^note-12b|firstling]] that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord's. ^verse-12

**13**  And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the [[#^note-13a|firstborn]] of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And it shall be when thy [[#^note-14a|son]] [[#^note-14b|asketh]] thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord [[#^note-14c|brought]] us out from Egypt, from the house of [[#^note-14d|bondage]]: ^verse-14

**15**  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord [[#^note-15a|slew]] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. ^verse-15

**16**  And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for [[#^note-16a|frontlets]] between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest [[#^note-17a|peradventure]] the people [[#^note-17b|repent]] when they see war, and they [[#^note-17c|return]] to Egypt: ^verse-17

**18**  But God [[#^note-18a|led]] the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of [[#^note-18b|Israel]] went up [[#^note-18c|harnessed]] out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-18

**19**  And Moses took the bones of [[#^note-19a|Joseph]] with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my [[#^note-19b|bones]] away hence with you. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And they took their journey from [[#^note-20a|Succoth]], and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. ^verse-20

**21**  And the [[#^note-21a|Lord]] went before them by day in a pillar of a [[#^note-21b|cloud]], to [[#^note-21c|lead]] them the way; and by night in a [[#^note-21d|pillar]] of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: ^verse-21

**22**  He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. ^verse-22
