*Moses hews new tables of stone—He goes up into Mount Sinai for forty days—The Lord proclaims His name and attributes and reveals His law—He makes another covenant with Israel—The skin of Moses' face shines, and he wears a veil.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] the Lord said unto Moses, [[#^note-1b|Hew]] thee two [[#^note-1c|tables]] of stone like unto the first: and I will [[#^note-1d|write]] upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou [[#^note-1e|brakest]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the [[#^note-2a|top]] of the mount. ^verse-2

**3**  And no man shall [[#^note-3a|come]] up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And he hewed two [[#^note-4a|tables]] of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and [[#^note-5a|proclaimed]] the name of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, [[#^note-6a|merciful]] and [[#^note-6b|gracious]], [[#^note-6c|longsuffering]], and abundant in [[#^note-6d|goodness]] and truth, ^verse-6

**7**  Keeping mercy for thousands, [[#^note-7a|forgiving]] iniquity and transgression and [[#^note-7b|sin]], [[#^note-7c|and that]] will by no means [[#^note-7d|clear]] the [[#^note-7e|guilty]]; visiting the [[#^note-7f|iniquity]] of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. ^verse-7

**8**  And Moses made haste, and [[#^note-8a|bowed]] his head toward the earth, and worshipped. ^verse-8

**9**  And he said, If now I have found [[#^note-9a|grace]] in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a [[#^note-9b|stiffnecked]] people; and [[#^note-9c|pardon]] our iniquity and our sin, and take us for [[#^note-9d|thine]] [[#^note-9e|inheritance]]. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do [[#^note-10a|marvels]], such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord: for it is a [[#^note-10b|terrible]] thing that I will do with thee. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Observe]] thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I [[#^note-11b|drive]] out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. ^verse-11

**12**  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a [[#^note-12a|covenant]] with the [[#^note-12b|inhabitants]] of the land whither thou goest, lest it [[#^note-12c|be for a]] snare in the midst of thee: ^verse-12

**13**  But ye shall [[#^note-13a|destroy]] their [[#^note-13b|altars]], break their images, and cut down their [[#^note-13c|groves]]: ^verse-13

**14**  For thou shalt worship [[#^note-14a|no]] other [[#^note-14b|god]]: for the Lord, whose name is [[#^note-14c|Jealous]], is a [[#^note-14d|jealous]] God: ^verse-14

**15**  Lest thou make a [[#^note-15a|covenant]] with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a [[#^note-15b|whoring]] after their [[#^note-15c|gods]], and do sacrifice unto their gods, and [[#^note-15d|one]] [[#^note-15e|call]] thee, and thou [[#^note-15f|eat]] of his sacrifice; ^verse-15

**16**  And thou [[#^note-16a|take]] of their [[#^note-16b|daughters]] unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. ^verse-16

**17**  Thou shalt make thee no molten [[#^note-17a|gods]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ The [[#^note-18a|feast]] of [[#^note-18b|unleavened]] bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the [[#^note-18c|time]] of the month [[#^note-18d|Abib]]: for in the [[#^note-18e|month]] Abib thou camest out from Egypt. ^verse-18

**19**  All that [[#^note-19a|openeth]] the [[#^note-19b|matrix]] is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. ^verse-19

**20**  But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the [[#^note-20a|firstborn]] of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt [[#^note-21a|rest]]: in [[#^note-21b|earing]] time and in harvest thou shalt rest. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And thou shalt observe the [[#^note-22a|feast]] of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ [[#^note-23a|Thrice]] in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. ^verse-23

**24**  For I will [[#^note-24a|cast out]] the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man [[#^note-24b|desire]] thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year. ^verse-24

**25**  Thou shalt not offer the [[#^note-25a|blood]] of my sacrifice with [[#^note-25b|leaven]]; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be [[#^note-25c|left]] unto the morning. ^verse-25

**26**  The first of the [[#^note-26a|firstfruits]] of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not [[#^note-26b|seethe]] a kid in his mother's milk. ^verse-26

**27**  And the Lord said unto Moses, [[#^note-27a|Write]] thou these words: for [[#^note-27b|after]] the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. ^verse-27

**28**  And he was there with the Lord [[#^note-28a|forty]] days and forty nights; he did neither [[#^note-28b|eat]] bread, nor drink water. And he [[#^note-28c|wrote]] upon the tables the words of the [[#^note-28d|covenant]], the [[#^note-28e|ten]] [[#^note-28f|commandments]]. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the [[#^note-29a|two]] [[#^note-29b|tables]] of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses [[#^note-29c|wist]] not that the skin of his face [[#^note-29d|shone]] while he talked with him. ^verse-29

**30**  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. ^verse-30

**31**  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the [[#^note-31a|rulers]] of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. ^verse-31

**32**  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai. ^verse-32

**33**  And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a [[#^note-33a|veil]] on his face. ^verse-33

**34**  But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. ^verse-34

**35**  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. ^verse-35
