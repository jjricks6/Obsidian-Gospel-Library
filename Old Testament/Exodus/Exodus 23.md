[[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 22|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Exodus/Exodus 24|Next Entry]]

*The Lord reveals His laws pertaining to integrity and godly conduct—The land is to rest during a sabbatical year—The children of Israel are to keep three annual feasts—An angel, bearing the Lord's name, will guide them—Sickness will be removed—The nations of Canaan will be driven out gradually.*

**1**  Thou shalt not raise a [[#^note-1a|false]] report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ [[#^note-2a|Thou]] shalt not [[#^note-2b|follow]] a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest [[#^note-2c|judgment]]: ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Neither shalt thou [[#^note-3a|countenance]] a [[#^note-3b|poor man]] in his cause. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ If thou meet thine [[#^note-4a|enemy's]] ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely [[#^note-4b|bring]] it back to him again. ^verse-4

**5**  If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to [[#^note-5a|help]] him, thou shalt surely help with him. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou shalt not [[#^note-6a|wrest]] the [[#^note-6b|judgment]] of thy poor in his [[#^note-6c|cause]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Keep thee far from a false [[#^note-7a|matter]]; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not [[#^note-7b|justify]] the wicked. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And thou shalt take no [[#^note-8a|gift]]: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. ^verse-9

**10**  And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: ^verse-10

**11**  But the [[#^note-11a|seventh]] year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the [[#^note-11b|poor]] of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. ^verse-11

**12**  Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the [[#^note-12a|seventh day]] thou shalt [[#^note-12b|rest]]: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. ^verse-12

**13**  And in all things that I have said unto you [[#^note-13a|be circumspect]]: and make no mention of the name of other [[#^note-13b|gods]], neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ [[#^note-14a|Three]] times thou shalt keep a [[#^note-14b|feast]] unto me in the year. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou shalt keep the [[#^note-15a|feast]] of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month [[#^note-15b|Abib]]; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me [[#^note-15c|empty]]:) ^verse-15

**16**  And the [[#^note-16a|feast]] of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of [[#^note-16b|ingathering]], which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in [[#^note-16c|thy]] labours out of the field. ^verse-16

**17**  Three times in the year all thy [[#^note-17a|males]] shall appear before the Lord God. ^verse-17

**18**  Thou shalt not offer the [[#^note-18a|blood]] of my sacrifice with [[#^note-18b|leavened]] bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. ^verse-18

**19**  The first of the [[#^note-19a|firstfruits]] of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not [[#^note-19b|seethe]] a kid in his mother's milk. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Behold, I send an [[#^note-20a|Angel]] before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. ^verse-20

**21**  Beware of him, and obey his voice, [[#^note-21a|provoke]] him not; for he will not [[#^note-21b|pardon]] your [[#^note-21c|transgressions]]: for my name is in him. ^verse-21

**22**  But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine [[#^note-22a|enemies]], and an adversary unto thine adversaries. ^verse-22

**23**  For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. ^verse-23

**24**  Thou shalt not [[#^note-24a|bow]] down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly [[#^note-24b|overthrow]] them, and quite break down their images. ^verse-24

**25**  And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy [[#^note-25a|bread]], and thy water; and I will take [[#^note-25b|sickness]] away from the midst of thee. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ [[#^note-26a|There]] shall nothing cast their young, nor be [[#^note-26b|barren]], in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. ^verse-26

**27**  I will send my [[#^note-27a|fear]] before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. ^verse-27

**28**  And I will send [[#^note-28a|hornets]] before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. ^verse-28

**29**  I will not [[#^note-29a|drive]] them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the [[#^note-29b|beast]] of the field multiply against thee. ^verse-29

**30**  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. ^verse-30

**31**  And I will set thy [[#^note-31a|bounds]] from the [[#^note-31b|Red sea]] even unto [[#^note-31c|the]] sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the [[#^note-31d|river]]: for I will [[#^note-31e|deliver]] the [[#^note-31f|inhabitants]] of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. ^verse-31

**32**  Thou shalt make no [[#^note-32a|covenant]] with them, nor with their gods. ^verse-32

**33**  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a [[#^note-33a|snare]] unto thee. ^verse-33
