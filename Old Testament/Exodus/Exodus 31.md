*Artisans are inspired in building and furnishing the tabernacle—Israel is commanded to keep the Lord's Sabbaths—The death penalty is decreed for Sabbath desecration—Moses receives the stone tablets.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  See, I have called by name [[#^note-2a|Bezaleel]] the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: ^verse-2

**3**  And I have filled him with the [[#^note-3a|spirit]] of God, in [[#^note-3b|wisdom]], and in understanding, and in [[#^note-3c|knowledge]], and in all manner of [[#^note-3d|workmanship]], ^verse-3

**4**  To devise [[#^note-4a|cunning works]], to work in [[#^note-4b|gold]], and in silver, and in brass, ^verse-4

**5**  And in [[#^note-5a|cutting]] of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. ^verse-5

**6**  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are [[#^note-6a|wise]] hearted I have put [[#^note-6b|wisdom]], that they may make all that I have commanded thee; ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|tabernacle of the congregation]], and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, ^verse-7

**8**  And the table and [[#^note-8a|his furniture]], and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, ^verse-8

**9**  And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, ^verse-9

**10**  And the [[#^note-10a|cloths of service]], and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, ^verse-10

**11**  And the [[#^note-11a|anointing oil]], and sweet [[#^note-11b|incense]] for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-12

**13**  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my [[#^note-13a|sabbaths]] ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. ^verse-13

**14**  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is [[#^note-14a|holy]] unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to [[#^note-14b|death]]: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. ^verse-14

**15**  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of [[#^note-15a|rest]], holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any [[#^note-15b|work]] in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. ^verse-15

**16**  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual [[#^note-16a|covenant]]. ^verse-16

**17**  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in [[#^note-17a|six]] days the Lord [[#^note-17b|made]] heaven and earth, and on the [[#^note-17c|seventh day]] he [[#^note-17d|rested]], and was [[#^note-17e|refreshed]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two [[#^note-18a|tables]] of [[#^note-18b|testimony]], tables of stone, [[#^note-18c|written]] with the finger of God. ^verse-18
