*The tabernacle is to contain an altar for burnt offerings and a court surrounded by pillars—A light is to burn always in the tabernacle of the congregation.*

**1**  And thou shalt make an [[#^note-1a|altar]] of [[#^note-1b|shittim]] wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. ^verse-1

**2**  And thou shalt make the [[#^note-2a|horns]] of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be [[#^note-2b|of the same]]: and thou shalt overlay it with [[#^note-2c|brass]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And thou shalt make his [[#^note-3a|pans]] to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basins, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. ^verse-3

**4**  And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof. ^verse-4

**5**  And thou shalt put it under the [[#^note-5a|compass]] of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar. ^verse-5

**6**  And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. ^verse-6

**7**  And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it. ^verse-7

**8**  Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was [[#^note-8a|shewed]] thee in the mount, so shall they make it. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined [[#^note-9a|linen]] of an hundred cubits long for one side: ^verse-9

**10**  And the twenty [[#^note-10a|pillars]] thereof and their twenty [[#^note-10b|sockets]] shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver. ^verse-10

**11**  And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. ^verse-12

**13**  And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. ^verse-13

**14**  The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^verse-14

**15**  And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And for the gate of the court shall be an [[#^note-16a|hanging]] of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four. ^verse-16

**17**  All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. ^verse-18

**19**  All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure [[#^note-20a|oil]] [[#^note-20b|olive]] beaten for the light, to cause the [[#^note-20c|lamp]] to burn always. ^verse-20

**21**  In the [[#^note-21a|tabernacle]] of the [[#^note-21b|congregation]] [[#^note-21c|without]] the [[#^note-21d|veil]], which is before the testimony, [[#^note-21e|Aaron]] and his sons shall [[#^note-21f|order it]] from evening to morning before the Lord: it shall be a [[#^note-21g|statute]] for ever unto their [[#^note-21h|generations]] on the behalf of the children of Israel. ^verse-21
