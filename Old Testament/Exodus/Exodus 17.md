*Israel murmurs for want of water—Moses smites a rock in Horeb, and water gushes forth—Aaron and Hur uphold Moses' hands so that Joshua prevails against Amalek.*

**1**  And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of [[#^note-1a|Sin]], after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and [[#^note-1b|pitched]] in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore the people [[#^note-2a|did chide with]] Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye [[#^note-2b|tempt the Lord]]? ^verse-2

**3**  And the people thirsted there for water; and the people [[#^note-3a|murmured]] against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? ^verse-3

**4**  And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy [[#^note-5a|rod]], [[#^note-5b|wherewith]] thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt [[#^note-6a|smite]] the [[#^note-6b|rock]], and there shall come [[#^note-6c|water]] out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  And he called the name of the place [[#^note-7a|Massah]], and [[#^note-7b|Meribah]], because of the [[#^note-7c|chiding]] of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us, or not? ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Then came [[#^note-8a|Amalek]], and fought with Israel in Rephidim. ^verse-8

**9**  And Moses said unto [[#^note-9a|Joshua]], Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the [[#^note-9b|rod]] of God in mine hand. ^verse-9

**10**  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. ^verse-10

**11**  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. ^verse-11

**12**  But Moses' hands [[#^note-12a|were heavy]]; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur [[#^note-12b|stayed up]] his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. ^verse-12

**13**  And Joshua [[#^note-13a|discomfited]] Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a [[#^note-14a|book]], and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of [[#^note-14b|Amalek]] from under heaven. ^verse-14

**15**  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it [[#^note-15a|Jehovah-nissi]]: ^verse-15

**16**  For he said, [[#^note-16a|Because]] the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. ^verse-16
