[[Old Testament/Nahum|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Nahum/Nahum 2|Next Entry]]

*Nahum speaks of the burning of the earth at the Second Coming and of the mercy and power of the Lord.*

**1**  The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. ^verse-1

**2**  God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord is [[#^note-3a|slow to anger]], and great in power, and will not at all acquit the [[#^note-3b|wicked]]: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. ^verse-3

**4**  He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. ^verse-4

**5**  The mountains quake at him, and the hills [[#^note-5a|melt]], and the earth is [[#^note-5b|burned]] at his [[#^note-5c|presence]], yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. ^verse-5

**6**  Who can stand before his [[#^note-6a|indignation]]? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. ^verse-6

**7**  The Lord is [[#^note-7a|good]], a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that [[#^note-7b|trust]] in him. ^verse-7

**8**  But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. ^verse-8

**9**  What do ye imagine against the Lord? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. ^verse-9

**10**  For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as [[#^note-10a|stubble]] fully dry. ^verse-10

**11**  There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the Lord, a wicked counsellor. ^verse-11

**12**  Thus saith the Lord; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. ^verse-12

**13**  For now will I break his [[#^note-13a|yoke]] from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Lord hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold upon the mountains the [[#^note-15a|feet]] of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off. ^verse-15
