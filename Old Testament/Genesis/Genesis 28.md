[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 29|Next Entry]]

*Isaac forbids Jacob to marry a Canaanite—He blesses Jacob and his seed with the blessings of Abraham—Esau marries a daughter of Ishmael—Jacob sees in vision a ladder reaching up into heaven—The Lord promises him seed as the dust of the earth in number—The Lord also promises Jacob that in him and in his seed all the families of the earth will be blessed—Jacob covenants to pay tithes.*

**1**  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a [[#^note-1a|wife]] of the daughters of [[#^note-1b|Canaan]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Arise, go to [[#^note-2a|Padan-aram]], to the house of [[#^note-2b|Bethuel]] thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of [[#^note-2c|Laban]] thy mother's brother. ^verse-2

**3**  And God [[#^note-3a|Almighty]] [[#^note-3b|bless]] thee, and make thee [[#^note-3c|fruitful]], and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a [[#^note-3d|multitude]] of people; ^verse-3

**4**  And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy [[#^note-4a|seed]] with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. ^verse-4

**5**  And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the [[#^note-5a|Syrian]], the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; ^verse-6

**7**  And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram; ^verse-7

**8**  And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; ^verse-8

**9**  Then went Esau unto [[#^note-9a|Ishmael]], and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his [[#^note-9b|wife]]. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. ^verse-10

**11**  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. ^verse-11

**12**  And he [[#^note-12a|dreamed]], and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the [[#^note-12b|angels]] of God ascending and descending on it. ^verse-12

**13**  And, behold, the [[#^note-13a|Lord]] stood [[#^note-13b|above it]], and said, I am the [[#^note-13c|Lord God]] of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the [[#^note-13d|land]] whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; ^verse-13

**14**  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the [[#^note-14a|north]], and to the south: and in thee and in thy [[#^note-14b|seed]] shall all the [[#^note-14c|families]] of the earth be [[#^note-14d|blessed]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And, behold, [[#^note-15a|I]] am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will [[#^note-15b|bring]] thee again into this [[#^note-15c|land]]; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. ^verse-16

**17**  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of [[#^note-17a|heaven]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a [[#^note-18a|pillar]], and poured oil upon the top of it. ^verse-18

**19**  And he called the name of that place [[#^note-19a|Beth-el]]: but the name of that city was called [[#^note-19b|Luz]] at the first. ^verse-19

**20**  And Jacob [[#^note-20a|vow]]ed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ^verse-20

**21**  So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the [[#^note-21a|Lord]] be my God: ^verse-21

**22**  And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the [[#^note-22a|tenth]] unto thee. ^verse-22
