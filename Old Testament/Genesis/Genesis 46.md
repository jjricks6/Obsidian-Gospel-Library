*The Lord sends Jacob and his family of seventy souls to Egypt—The descendants of Jacob are named—Joseph meets Jacob.*

**1**  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to [[#^note-1a|Beer-sheba]], and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. ^verse-1

**2**  And God spake unto Israel in the [[#^note-2a|visions]] of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said, I am God, the God of thy [[#^note-3a|father]]: fear not to go down into [[#^note-3b|Egypt]]; for I will there make of thee a great [[#^note-3c|nation]]: ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|I]] will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely [[#^note-4b|bring]] thee up again: and [[#^note-4c|Joseph]] shall put his hand upon thine eyes. ^verse-4

**5**  And Jacob [[#^note-5a|rose up]] from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the [[#^note-5b|wagons]] which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. ^verse-5

**6**  And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into [[#^note-6a|Egypt]], Jacob, and all his seed with him: ^verse-6

**7**  His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his [[#^note-7a|seed]] brought he with him into Egypt. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And these are the [[#^note-8a|names]] of the [[#^note-8b|children of Israel]], which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. ^verse-8

**9**  And the sons of [[#^note-9a|Reuben]]; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-11a|Levi]]; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And the sons of Judah; [[#^note-12a|Er]], and [[#^note-12b|Onan]], and Shelah, and Pharez, and [[#^note-12c|Zerah]]: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-13a|Issachar]]; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. ^verse-14

**15**  These be the sons of [[#^note-15a|Leah]], which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-16a|Gad]]; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. ^verse-17

**18**  These are the sons of [[#^note-18a|Zilpah]], whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. ^verse-18

**19**  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and [[#^note-19a|Benjamin]]. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born [[#^note-20a|Manasseh]] and Ephraim, which [[#^note-20b|Asenath]] the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-21a|Benjamin]] were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. ^verse-21

**22**  These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-23a|Dan]]; Hushim. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. ^verse-24

**25**  These are the sons of [[#^note-25a|Bilhah]], which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. ^verse-25

**26**  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; ^verse-26

**27**  And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of [[#^note-27a|Jacob]], which came into Egypt, were [[#^note-27b|threescore]] and ten. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto [[#^note-28a|Goshen]]; and they came into the land of Goshen. ^verse-28

**29**  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and [[#^note-29a|wept]] on his neck a good while. ^verse-29

**30**  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. ^verse-30

**31**  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew [[#^note-31a|Pharaoh]], and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; ^verse-31

**32**  And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. ^verse-32

**33**  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your [[#^note-33a|occupation]]? ^verse-33

**34**  That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about [[#^note-34a|cattle]] from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an [[#^note-34b|abomination]] unto the Egyptians. ^verse-34
