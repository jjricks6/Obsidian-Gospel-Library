*Abram will become a great nation—He and his seed will bless all the families of the earth—He travels from Haran to the land of Canaan—Because of famine, he goes down into Egypt—Abram and Sarai are tested in Pharaoh's court.*

**1**  Now the Lord had [[#^note-1a|said]] unto [[#^note-1b|Abram]], [[#^note-1c|Get]] thee out of thy [[#^note-1d|country]], and from thy [[#^note-1e|kindred]], and from thy [[#^note-1f|father's]] house, unto a [[#^note-1g|land]] that I will shew thee: ^verse-1

**2**  And I will make of thee a [[#^note-2a|great]] [[#^note-2b|nation]], and I will [[#^note-2c|bless]] thee, and make thy [[#^note-2d|name]] great; and thou shalt be a blessing: ^verse-2

**3**  And I will [[#^note-3a|bless]] them that bless thee, and [[#^note-3b|curse]] him that [[#^note-3c|curseth]] thee: and in thee shall all [[#^note-3d|families]] of the earth be [[#^note-3e|blessed]]. ^verse-3

**4**  So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was [[#^note-4a|seventy]] and five years old when he departed out of Haran. ^verse-4

**5**  And Abram took [[#^note-5a|Sarai]] his wife, and [[#^note-5b|Lot]] his [[#^note-5c|brother's]] son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had [[#^note-5d|gotten]] in [[#^note-5e|Haran]]; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the [[#^note-6a|Canaanite]] was then in the land. ^verse-6

**7**  And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, [[#^note-7a|Unto]] thy [[#^note-7b|seed]] will I give this [[#^note-7c|land]]: and there builded he an [[#^note-7d|altar]] unto the Lord, who appeared unto him. ^verse-7

**8**  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of [[#^note-8a|Beth-el]], and pitched his tent, having [[#^note-8b|Beth-el]] on the west, and [[#^note-8c|Hai]] on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and [[#^note-8d|called upon]] the [[#^note-8e|name]] of the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And there was a [[#^note-10a|famine]] in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. ^verse-10

**11**  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he [[#^note-11a|said]] unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. ^verse-12

**13**  Say, I pray thee, thou art my [[#^note-13a|sister]]: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians [[#^note-14a|beheld]] the woman that she was very fair. ^verse-14

**15**  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. ^verse-15

**16**  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. ^verse-16

**17**  And the Lord [[#^note-17a|plagued]] Pharaoh and his house with great [[#^note-17b|plagues]] because of Sarai Abram's wife. ^verse-17

**18**  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast [[#^note-18a|done]] unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? ^verse-18

**19**  Why saidst thou, She is my [[#^note-19a|sister]]? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. ^verse-19

**20**  And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. ^verse-20
