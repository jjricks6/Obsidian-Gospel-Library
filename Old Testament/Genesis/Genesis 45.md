*Joseph makes himself known to his brothers—They rejoice together—Pharaoh invites Jacob and his family to dwell in Egypt and eat the fat of the land.*

**1**  Then Joseph could not [[#^note-1a|refrain]] himself before all them that stood by him; and he [[#^note-1b|cried]], Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. ^verse-1

**2**  And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. ^verse-2

**3**  And [[#^note-3a|Joseph]] said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were [[#^note-3b|troubled]] at his presence. ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|Joseph]] said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. ^verse-4

**5**  Now therefore be not [[#^note-5a|grieved]], nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did [[#^note-5b|send]] me before you to preserve life. ^verse-5

**6**  For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. ^verse-6

**7**  And God sent me before you to [[#^note-7a|preserve]] you a [[#^note-7b|posterity]] in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. ^verse-7

**8**  So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a [[#^note-8a|ruler]] throughout all the land of Egypt. ^verse-8

**9**  Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: ^verse-9

**10**  And thou shalt dwell in the land of [[#^note-10a|Goshen]], and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: ^verse-10

**11**  And there will I [[#^note-11a|nourish]] thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. ^verse-11

**12**  And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. ^verse-12

**13**  And ye shall tell my [[#^note-13a|father]] of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. ^verse-13

**14**  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. ^verse-14

**15**  Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it [[#^note-16a|pleased]] Pharaoh well, and his servants. ^verse-16

**17**  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; ^verse-17

**18**  And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. ^verse-18

**19**  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you [[#^note-19a|wagons]] out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. ^verse-19

**20**  Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. ^verse-20

**21**  And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. ^verse-21

**22**  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to [[#^note-22a|Benjamin]] he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. ^verse-22

**23**  And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. ^verse-23

**24**  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, ^verse-25

**26**  And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is [[#^note-26a|governor]] over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. ^verse-26

**27**  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the [[#^note-27a|wagons]] which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father [[#^note-27b|revived]]: ^verse-27

**28**  And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. ^verse-28
