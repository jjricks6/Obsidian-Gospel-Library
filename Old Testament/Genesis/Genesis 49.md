[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 48|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 50|Next Entry]]

*Jacob blesses his sons and their seed—Reuben, Simeon, and Levi are chastened—Judah will rule until Shiloh (Christ) comes—Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well—His branches (the Nephites and Lamanites) will run over the wall—The Shepherd and Stone of Israel (Christ) will bless Joseph temporally and spiritually—Jacob chooses to be buried with his fathers in Canaan—He yields up the ghost and is gathered to his people.*

**1**  And [[#^note-1a|Jacob]] called unto his [[#^note-1b|sons]], and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the [[#^note-1c|last days]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your [[#^note-2a|father]]. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ [[#^note-3a|Reuben]], thou art my firstborn, my might, and the [[#^note-3b|beginning]] of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: ^verse-3

**4**  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's [[#^note-4a|bed]]; then [[#^note-4b|defiledst]] thou it: he went up to my couch. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ [[#^note-5a|Simeon]] and [[#^note-5b|Levi]] are brethren; instruments of [[#^note-5c|cruelty]] are in their habitations. ^verse-5

**6**  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou [[#^note-6a|united]]: for in their [[#^note-6b|anger]] they [[#^note-6c|slew]] a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Cursed]] be their [[#^note-7b|anger]], for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was [[#^note-7c|cruel]]: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ [[#^note-8a|Judah]], thou art he whom thy brethren shall [[#^note-8b|praise]]: thy hand shall be in the [[#^note-8c|neck]] of thine enemies; thy father's children shall [[#^note-8d|bow]] down before thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Judah is a [[#^note-9a|lion's]] whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a [[#^note-9b|lion]], and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? ^verse-9

**10**  The sceptre shall not depart from [[#^note-10a|Judah]], nor a [[#^note-10b|lawgiver]] from between his feet, until [[#^note-10c|Shiloh]] come; and unto him shall the [[#^note-10d|gathering]] of the people be. ^verse-10

**11**  Binding his foal unto the [[#^note-11a|vine]], and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he [[#^note-11b|washed]] his garments in wine, and his clothes in the [[#^note-11c|blood]] of grapes: ^verse-11

**12**  His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ [[#^note-13a|Zebulun]] shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ [[#^note-14a|Issachar]] is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: ^verse-14

**15**  And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ [[#^note-16a|Dan]] shall [[#^note-16b|judge]] his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. ^verse-16

**17**  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. ^verse-17

**18**  I have [[#^note-18a|waited]] for thy salvation, O Lord. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ [[#^note-19a|Gad]], a [[#^note-19b|troop]] shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Out of [[#^note-20a|Asher]] his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ [[#^note-21a|Naphtali]] is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ [[#^note-22a|Joseph]] is a fruitful [[#^note-22b|bough]], even a fruitful bough by a well; whose [[#^note-22c|branches]] [[#^note-22d|run]] over the wall: ^verse-22

**23**  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: ^verse-23

**24**  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from [[#^note-24a|thence]] is the [[#^note-24b|shepherd]], the [[#^note-24c|stone]] of Israel:) ^verse-24

**25**  Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the [[#^note-25a|Almighty]], who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the [[#^note-25b|womb]]: ^verse-25

**26**  The [[#^note-26a|blessings]] of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the [[#^note-26b|utmost]] bound of the everlasting [[#^note-26c|hills]]: they shall be on the head of [[#^note-26d|Joseph]], and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ [[#^note-27a|Benjamin]] shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ All these are the [[#^note-28a|twelve tribes]] of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and [[#^note-28b|blessed]] them; every one according to his [[#^note-28c|blessing]] he blessed them. ^verse-28

**29**  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my [[#^note-29a|people]]: [[#^note-29b|bury]] me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, ^verse-29

**30**  In the cave that is in the field of [[#^note-30a|Machpelah]], which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of [[#^note-30b|Ephron]] the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. ^verse-30

**31**  There they [[#^note-31a|buried]] Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. ^verse-31

**32**  The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. ^verse-32

**33**  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the [[#^note-33a|ghost]], and was [[#^note-33b|gathered]] unto his people. ^verse-33
