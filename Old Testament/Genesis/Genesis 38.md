*Judah has three sons by a Canaanite woman—Er and Onan are slain by the Lord—Tamar, disguised as a harlot, bears twins by Judah.*

**1**  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. ^verse-1

**2**  And Judah saw there a [[#^note-2a|daughter]] of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. ^verse-2

**3**  And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name [[#^note-3a|Er]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. ^verse-4

**5**  And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. ^verse-5

**6**  And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. ^verse-6

**7**  And [[#^note-7a|Er]], Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him. ^verse-7

**8**  And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's [[#^note-8a|wife]], and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. ^verse-8

**9**  And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. ^verse-9

**10**  And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also. ^verse-10

**11**  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. ^verse-12

**13**  And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. ^verse-13

**14**  And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. ^verse-14

**15**  When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. ^verse-15

**16**  And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? ^verse-16

**17**  And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? ^verse-17

**18**  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy [[#^note-18a|signet]], and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. ^verse-18

**19**  And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. ^verse-19

**20**  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. ^verse-20

**21**  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. ^verse-21

**22**  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. ^verse-22

**23**  And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be [[#^note-24a|burnt]]. ^verse-24

**25**  When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the [[#^note-25a|signet]], and bracelets, and staff. ^verse-25

**26**  And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. ^verse-27

**28**  And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. ^verse-28

**29**  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called [[#^note-29a|Pharez]]. ^verse-29

**30**  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called [[#^note-30a|Zarah]]. ^verse-30
