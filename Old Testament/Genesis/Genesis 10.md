*The descendants of Noah are Japheth, whose descendants are Gentiles; Ham, whose descendants include the Canaanites; and Shem, of whom came Peleg (in whose days the earth was divided).*

**1**  Now these are the [[#^note-1a|generations]] of the [[#^note-1b|sons]] of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. ^verse-1

**2**  The sons of Japheth; [[#^note-2a|Gomer]], and [[#^note-2b|Magog]], and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and [[#^note-2c|Meshech]], and Tiras. ^verse-2

**3**  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and [[#^note-3a|Togarmah]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And the sons of [[#^note-4a|Javan]]; [[#^note-4b|Elishah]], and Tarshish, Kittim, and [[#^note-4c|Dodanim]]. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|By these]] were the [[#^note-5b|isles]] of the [[#^note-5c|Gentiles]] divided in their [[#^note-5d|lands]]; every one after his tongue, after their [[#^note-5e|families]], in their nations. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And the sons of [[#^note-6a|Ham]]; [[#^note-6b|Cush]], and [[#^note-6c|Mizraim]], and [[#^note-6d|Phut]], and Canaan. ^verse-6

**7**  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. ^verse-7

**8**  And Cush begat [[#^note-8a|Nimrod]]: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. ^verse-8

**9**  He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as [[#^note-9a|Nimrod]] the mighty hunter before the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  And the beginning of his kingdom was [[#^note-10a|Babel]], and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of [[#^note-10b|Shinar]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, ^verse-11

**12**  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. ^verse-12

**13**  And [[#^note-13a|Mizraim]] begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, ^verse-13

**14**  And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came [[#^note-14a|Philistim]],) and Caphtorim. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And [[#^note-15a|Canaan]] begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, ^verse-15

**16**  And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, ^verse-16

**17**  And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, ^verse-17

**18**  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the [[#^note-18a|Canaanites]] spread abroad. ^verse-18

**19**  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to [[#^note-19a|Gerar]], unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. ^verse-19

**20**  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of [[#^note-21a|Eber]], the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. ^verse-21

**22**  The children of [[#^note-22a|Shem]]; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. ^verse-22

**23**  And the children of Aram; [[#^note-23a|Uz]], and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. ^verse-23

**24**  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. ^verse-24

**25**  And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was [[#^note-25a|Peleg]]; for in his days was the earth [[#^note-25b|divided]]; and his brother's name was Joktan. ^verse-25

**26**  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, ^verse-26

**27**  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, ^verse-27

**28**  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, ^verse-28

**29**  And Ophir, and [[#^note-29a|Havilah]], and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. ^verse-29

**30**  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. ^verse-30

**31**  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. ^verse-31

**32**  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their [[#^note-32a|nations]]: and [[#^note-32b|by]] these were the [[#^note-32c|nations]] divided in the earth after the flood. ^verse-32
