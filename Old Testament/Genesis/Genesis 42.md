*Jacob sends his sons to buy grain in Egypt—They bow before Joseph—He makes harsh accusations against them, imprisons Simeon, and sends them back for Benjamin.*

**1**  Now when Jacob saw that there was [[#^note-1a|corn]] in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? ^verse-1

**2**  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy [[#^note-3a|corn]] in Egypt. ^verse-3

**4**  But [[#^note-4a|Benjamin]], Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. ^verse-4

**5**  And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. ^verse-5

**6**  And Joseph was the [[#^note-6a|governor]] over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and [[#^note-6b|bowed]] down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. ^verse-7

**8**  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. ^verse-8

**9**  And Joseph remembered the [[#^note-9a|dreams]] which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. ^verse-9

**10**  And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. ^verse-10

**11**  We are all one [[#^note-11a|man's]] sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. ^verse-11

**12**  And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. ^verse-12

**13**  And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is [[#^note-13a|not]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: ^verse-14

**15**  Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. ^verse-15

**16**  Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. ^verse-16

**17**  And he put them all together into ward three days. ^verse-17

**18**  And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I [[#^note-18a|fear]] God: ^verse-18

**19**  If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: ^verse-19

**20**  But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And they said one to another, We are verily [[#^note-21a|guilty]] concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. ^verse-21

**22**  And [[#^note-22a|Reuben]] answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his [[#^note-22b|blood]] is required. ^verse-22

**23**  And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. ^verse-23

**24**  And he turned himself about from them, and [[#^note-24a|wept]]; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's [[#^note-25a|money]] into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. ^verse-25

**26**  And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. ^verse-26

**27**  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his [[#^note-27a|money]]; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. ^verse-27

**28**  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, ^verse-29

**30**  The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. ^verse-30

**31**  And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: ^verse-31

**32**  We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. ^verse-32

**33**  And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: ^verse-33

**34**  And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. ^verse-34

**35**  ¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. ^verse-35

**36**  And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take [[#^note-36a|Benjamin]] away: all these things are against me. ^verse-36

**37**  And [[#^note-37a|Reuben]] spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. ^verse-37

**38**  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with [[#^note-38a|sorrow]] to the grave. ^verse-38
