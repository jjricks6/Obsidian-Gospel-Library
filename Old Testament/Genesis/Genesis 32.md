*Jacob sees angels—He asks God to preserve him from Esau, for whom he prepares presents—He wrestles all night with a messenger of God—Jacob's name is changed to Israel—He sees God face to face.*

**1**  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. ^verse-1

**2**  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's [[#^note-2a|host]]: and he called the name of that place [[#^note-2b|Mahanaim]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of [[#^note-3a|Seir]], the country of [[#^note-3b|Edom]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: ^verse-4

**5**  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. ^verse-6

**7**  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and [[#^note-7a|distressed]]: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; ^verse-7

**8**  And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And Jacob said, O [[#^note-9a|God]] of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, [[#^note-9b|Return]] unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|I]] am not worthy of the least of all the [[#^note-10b|mercies]], and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Deliver]] me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. ^verse-11

**12**  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy [[#^note-12a|seed]] as the [[#^note-12b|sand]] of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; ^verse-13

**14**  Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, ^verse-14

**15**  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. ^verse-15

**16**  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. ^verse-16

**17**  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? ^verse-17

**18**  Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. ^verse-18

**19**  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. ^verse-19

**20**  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. ^verse-20

**21**  So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. ^verse-21

**22**  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. ^verse-22

**23**  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and there [[#^note-24a|wrestled]] a man with him until the breaking of the day. ^verse-24

**25**  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. ^verse-25

**26**  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. ^verse-26

**27**  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. ^verse-27

**28**  And he said, Thy [[#^note-28a|name]] shall be called no more Jacob, but [[#^note-28b|Israel]]: [[#^note-28c|for]] as a [[#^note-28d|prince]] hast thou [[#^note-28e|power]] with God and with men, and hast [[#^note-28f|prevailed]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy [[#^note-29a|name]]. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he [[#^note-29b|blessed]] him there. ^verse-29

**30**  And Jacob called the name of the place [[#^note-30a|Peniel]]: for I have [[#^note-30b|seen]] God [[#^note-30c|face to face]], and my life is preserved. ^verse-30

**31**  And as he passed over [[#^note-31a|Penuel]] the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. ^verse-31

**32**  Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. ^verse-32
