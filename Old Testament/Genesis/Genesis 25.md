*Abraham marries, has descendants, dies, and is buried in the cave of Machpelah—His descendants through Ishmael are listed—Rebekah conceives, and Jacob and Esau struggle in her womb—The Lord reveals their destiny to Rebekah—Esau sells his birthright for a mess of pottage.*

**1**  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. ^verse-1

**2**  And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and [[#^note-2a|Medan]], and [[#^note-2b|Midian]], and Ishbak, and Shuah. ^verse-2

**3**  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. ^verse-3

**4**  And the sons of [[#^note-4a|Midian]]; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of [[#^note-4b|Keturah]]. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And [[#^note-5a|Abraham]] [[#^note-5b|gave]] all that he had unto Isaac. ^verse-5

**6**  But unto the sons of the [[#^note-6a|concubines]], which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and [[#^note-6b|sent]] them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, [[#^note-6c|east]]ward, unto the east country. ^verse-6

**7**  And these are the [[#^note-7a|days]] of the years of [[#^note-7b|Abraham's]] life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. ^verse-7

**8**  Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good [[#^note-8a|old]] age, an old man, and full of years; and was [[#^note-8b|gathered]] to his people. ^verse-8

**9**  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael [[#^note-9a|buried]] him in the cave of [[#^note-9b|Machpelah]], in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; ^verse-9

**10**  The field which Abraham [[#^note-10a|purchased]] of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham [[#^note-10b|buried]], and Sarah his wife. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the [[#^note-11a|well]] Lahai-roi. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Now these are the [[#^note-12a|generations]] of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom [[#^note-12b|Hagar]] the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, [[#^note-12c|bare]] unto Abraham: ^verse-12

**13**  And these are the names of the sons of [[#^note-13a|Ishmael]], by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, ^verse-13

**14**  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, ^verse-14

**15**  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: ^verse-15

**16**  These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; [[#^note-16a|twelve]] princes according to their nations. ^verse-16

**17**  And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. ^verse-17

**18**  And they dwelt from [[#^note-18a|Havilah]] unto [[#^note-18b|Shur]], that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And these are the generations of Isaac, [[#^note-19a|Abraham]]'s son: Abraham begat Isaac: ^verse-19

**20**  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of [[#^note-20a|Bethuel]] the Syrian of [[#^note-20b|Padan-aram]], the sister to Laban the Syrian. ^verse-20

**21**  And Isaac entreated the Lord for his [[#^note-21a|wife]], because she was [[#^note-21b|barren]]: and the Lord was [[#^note-21c|entreated]] of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. ^verse-21

**22**  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to [[#^note-22a|inquire]] of the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  And the Lord said unto her, [[#^note-23a|Two]] nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the [[#^note-23b|elder]] shall serve the younger. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. ^verse-24

**25**  And the first came out red, all over like an [[#^note-25a|hairy]] garment; and they called his name [[#^note-25b|Esau]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's [[#^note-26a|heel]]; and his [[#^note-26b|name]] was called [[#^note-26c|Jacob]]: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. ^verse-26

**27**  And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning [[#^note-27a|hunter]], a man of the field; and Jacob was a [[#^note-27b|plain]] man, dwelling in [[#^note-27c|tents]]. ^verse-27

**28**  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his [[#^note-28a|venison]]: but [[#^note-28b|Rebekah]] loved Jacob. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: ^verse-29

**30**  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called [[#^note-30a|Edom]]. ^verse-30

**31**  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy [[#^note-31a|birthright]]. ^verse-31

**32**  And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? ^verse-32

**33**  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. ^verse-33

**34**  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. ^verse-34
