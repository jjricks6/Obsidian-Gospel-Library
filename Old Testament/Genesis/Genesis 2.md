### Chapter 2

[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3|Next Entry]]

*The Creation is completed—God rests on the seventh day—The prior spirit creation is explained—Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden—They are forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil—Adam names every living creature—Adam and Eve are married by the Lord.*

**1**  Thus the heavens and the [[#^note-1a|earth]] were finished, and all the [[#^note-1b|host]] of them. ^verse-1

**2**  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had [[#^note-2a|made]]; and he [[#^note-2b|rested]] on the seventh day from all his [[#^note-2c|work]] which he had made. ^verse-2

**3**  And God blessed the [[#^note-3a|seventh day]], and [[#^note-3b|sanctified]] it: because that in it he had [[#^note-3c|rested]] from all his work which God [[#^note-3d|created and made]]. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were [[#^note-4a|created]], in the day that the [[#^note-4b|Lord God]] made the earth and the heavens, ^verse-4

**5**  And every [[#^note-5a|plant]] of the field [[#^note-5b|before]] it was in the [[#^note-5c|earth]], and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a [[#^note-5d|man]] to till the [[#^note-5e|ground]]. ^verse-5

**6**  But there went up a [[#^note-6a|mist]] from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. ^verse-6

**7**  And the Lord God [[#^note-7a|formed]] [[#^note-7b|man]] of the [[#^note-7c|dust]] of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the [[#^note-7d|breath of life]]; and [[#^note-7e|man]] became a living [[#^note-7f|soul]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in [[#^note-8a|Eden]]; and there he put the man whom he had formed. ^verse-8

**9**  And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the [[#^note-9a|sight]], and good for [[#^note-9b|food]]; the [[#^note-9c|tree]] of [[#^note-9d|life]] also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of [[#^note-9e|knowledge]] of good and evil. ^verse-9

**10**  And a river went out of [[#^note-10a|Eden]] to water the garden; and from thence it was [[#^note-10b|parted]], and became into four heads. ^verse-10

**11**  The name of the first is Pison: that is it which [[#^note-11a|compasseth]] the whole land of [[#^note-11b|Havilah]], where there is gold; ^verse-11

**12**  And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and [[#^note-12a|the onyx stone]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that [[#^note-13a|compasseth]] the whole land of [[#^note-13b|Ethiopia]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the [[#^note-15a|garden]] of [[#^note-15b|Eden]] [[#^note-15c|to dress it]] and to [[#^note-15d|keep]] it. ^verse-15

**16**  And the Lord God [[#^note-16a|commanded]] the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest [[#^note-16b|freely]] eat: ^verse-16

**17**  But of the [[#^note-17a|tree]] of the [[#^note-17b|knowledge]] of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the [[#^note-17c|day]] that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely [[#^note-17d|die]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be [[#^note-18a|alone]]; I will make him [[#^note-18b|an]] help meet for him. ^verse-18

**19**  And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto [[#^note-19a|Adam]] to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the [[#^note-19b|name]] thereof. ^verse-19

**20**  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; ^verse-21

**22**  And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a [[#^note-22a|woman]], and brought her unto the man. ^verse-22

**23**  And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and [[#^note-23a|flesh]] of my flesh: she shall be called [[#^note-23b|Woman]], because she was taken out of Man. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore shall a [[#^note-24a|man]] leave his [[#^note-24b|father]] and his mother, and shall [[#^note-24c|cleave]] unto his [[#^note-24d|wife]]: and they shall be [[#^note-24e|one]] flesh. ^verse-24

**25**  And they were both [[#^note-25a|naked]], the man and his wife, and were not [[#^note-25b|ashamed]]. ^verse-25
