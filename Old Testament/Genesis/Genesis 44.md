*Joseph arranges to stop the return of his brothers to Canaan—Judah offers himself in place of Benjamin for their father's sake.*

**1**  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. ^verse-1

**2**  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. ^verse-2

**3**  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. ^verse-3

**4**  And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? ^verse-4

**5**  Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. ^verse-6

**7**  And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? ^verse-8

**9**  With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. ^verse-9

**10**  And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. ^verse-10

**11**  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. ^verse-11

**12**  And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. ^verse-12

**13**  Then they [[#^note-13a|rent]] their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they [[#^note-14a|fell]] before him on the ground. ^verse-14

**15**  And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? ^verse-15

**16**  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. ^verse-16

**17**  And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my [[#^note-18a|lord]], let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine [[#^note-18b|anger]] burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. ^verse-18

**19**  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? ^verse-19

**20**  And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old [[#^note-20a|man]], and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. ^verse-20

**21**  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. ^verse-21

**22**  And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. ^verse-22

**23**  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest [[#^note-23a|brother]] come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. ^verse-23

**24**  And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. ^verse-24

**25**  And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. ^verse-25

**26**  And we said, We cannot go down: if our [[#^note-26a|youngest]] brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. ^verse-26

**27**  And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: ^verse-27

**28**  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is [[#^note-28a|torn]] in [[#^note-28b|pieces]]; and I saw him not since: ^verse-28

**29**  And if ye [[#^note-29a|take]] this also from me, and mischief befall [[#^note-29b|him]], ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. ^verse-29

**30**  Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is [[#^note-30a|bound]] up in the lad's life; ^verse-30

**31**  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with [[#^note-31a|sorrow]] to the grave. ^verse-31

**32**  For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the [[#^note-32a|blame]] to my father for ever. ^verse-32

**33**  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. ^verse-33

**34**  For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. ^verse-34
