*God sends Jacob to Bethel, where he builds an altar and the Lord appears to him—God renews the promise that Jacob will be a great nation and that his name will be Israel—Jacob sets up an altar and pours a drink offering—Rachel bears Benjamin, dies in childbirth, and is buried near Bethlehem—Reuben sins with Bilhah—Isaac dies and is buried by Jacob and Esau.*

**1**  And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou [[#^note-1a|fleddest]] from the face of Esau thy brother. ^verse-1

**2**  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange [[#^note-2a|gods]] that are among you, and be [[#^note-2b|clean]], and change your garments: ^verse-2

**3**  And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my [[#^note-3a|distress]], and was with me in the way which I went. ^verse-3

**4**  And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. ^verse-4

**5**  And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ So Jacob came to [[#^note-6a|Luz]], which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him. ^verse-6

**7**  And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. ^verse-7

**8**  But Deborah Rebekah's [[#^note-8a|nurse]] died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak: and the name of it was called [[#^note-8b|Allon-bachuth]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him. ^verse-9

**10**  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but [[#^note-10a|Israel]] shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. ^verse-10

**11**  And God said unto him, I am [[#^note-11a|God Almighty]]: be [[#^note-11b|fruitful]] and multiply; a nation and a company of [[#^note-11c|nations]] shall be of thee, and [[#^note-11d|kings]] shall come out of thy loins; ^verse-11

**12**  And the [[#^note-12a|land]] which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. ^verse-12

**13**  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. ^verse-13

**14**  And Jacob set up a [[#^note-14a|pillar]] in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a [[#^note-14b|drink]] offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. ^verse-14

**15**  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. ^verse-17

**18**  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she [[#^note-18a|died]]) that she called his name [[#^note-18b|Ben-oni]]: but his father called him [[#^note-18c|Benjamin]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And [[#^note-19a|Rachel]] died, and was buried in the way to [[#^note-19b|Ephrath]], which is Beth-lehem. ^verse-19

**20**  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the [[#^note-21a|tower]] of Edar. ^verse-21

**22**  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and [[#^note-22a|lay]] with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the [[#^note-22b|sons]] of Jacob were [[#^note-22c|twelve]]: ^verse-22

**23**  The sons of Leah; [[#^note-23a|Reuben]], Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: ^verse-23

**24**  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: ^verse-24

**25**  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: ^verse-25

**26**  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. ^verse-27

**28**  And the [[#^note-28a|days]] of [[#^note-28b|Isaac]] were an hundred and fourscore years. ^verse-28

**29**  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was [[#^note-29a|gathered]] unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob [[#^note-29b|buried]] him. ^verse-29
