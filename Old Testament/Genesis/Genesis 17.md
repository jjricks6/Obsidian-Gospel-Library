[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 16|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 18|Next Entry]]

*Abram is commanded to be perfect—He will be a father of many nations—His name is changed to Abraham—The Lord covenants to be a God unto Abraham and his seed forever—Also, the Lord gives Abraham the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession—Circumcision becomes a token of the everlasting covenant between God and Abraham—Sarai's name is changed to Sarah—She will bear Isaac, with whom the Lord will establish His covenant—Abraham and the men of his house are circumcised.*

**1**  And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord [[#^note-1a|appeared]] to [[#^note-1b|Abram]], and said unto him, I am the [[#^note-1c|Almighty God]]; [[#^note-1d|walk]] before me, and be thou [[#^note-1e|perfect]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And I will make my [[#^note-2a|covenant]] between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|And]] Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, ^verse-3

**4**  As for me, behold, my [[#^note-4a|covenant]] is with thee, and thou shalt be a [[#^note-4b|father]] of many [[#^note-4c|nations]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be [[#^note-5a|Abraham]]; for a father of many nations have I made thee. ^verse-5

**6**  And I will make thee exceeding [[#^note-6a|fruitful]], and I will make [[#^note-6b|nations]] of thee, and [[#^note-6c|kings]] shall come out of thee. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|And]] I will establish my [[#^note-7b|covenant]] between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an [[#^note-7c|everlasting covenant]], to be a [[#^note-7d|God]] unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. ^verse-7

**8**  And I will [[#^note-8a|give]] unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the [[#^note-8b|land]] wherein thou art a [[#^note-8c|stranger]], all the [[#^note-8d|land]] of [[#^note-8e|Canaan]], for an everlasting [[#^note-8f|possession]]; and I will be their [[#^note-8g|God]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. ^verse-9

**10**  This is my [[#^note-10a|covenant]], which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be [[#^note-10b|circumcised]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And ye shall [[#^note-11a|circumcise]] the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a [[#^note-11b|token]] of the [[#^note-11c|covenant]] betwixt me and you. ^verse-11

**12**  And he that is [[#^note-12a|eight]] days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or [[#^note-12b|bought]] with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. ^verse-12

**13**  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an [[#^note-13a|everlasting covenant]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be [[#^note-14a|cut off]] from his people; he hath broken my covenant. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but [[#^note-15a|Sarah]] shall her name be. ^verse-15

**16**  And I will bless her, and [[#^note-16a|give]] thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a [[#^note-16b|mother]] of nations; kings of people shall be of her. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Then]] Abraham fell upon his face, and [[#^note-17b|laughed]], and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an [[#^note-17c|hundred]] years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? ^verse-17

**18**  And Abraham said unto God, O that [[#^note-18a|Ishmael]] might live before thee! ^verse-18

**19**  And God said, [[#^note-19a|Sarah]] thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my [[#^note-19b|covenant]] with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. ^verse-19

**20**  And as for [[#^note-20a|Ishmael]], I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; [[#^note-20b|twelve]] princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. ^verse-20

**21**  But my [[#^note-21a|covenant]] will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set [[#^note-21b|time]] in the next year. ^verse-21

**22**  And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and [[#^note-23a|circumcised]] the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. ^verse-23

**24**  And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. ^verse-24

**25**  And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. ^verse-25

**26**  In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. ^verse-26

**27**  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. ^verse-27
