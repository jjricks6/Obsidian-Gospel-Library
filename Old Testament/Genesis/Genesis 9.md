[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 10|Next Entry]]

*Noah and his sons are commanded to multiply and fill the earth—They are given dominion over all forms of life—The death penalty is decreed for murder—God will not again destroy the earth by a flood—Canaan is cursed; Shem and Japheth are blessed.*

**1**  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, [[#^note-1a|Be]] fruitful, and [[#^note-1b|multiply]], and [[#^note-1c|replenish]] the earth. ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|fear]] of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. ^verse-2

**3**  Every moving thing that liveth shall be [[#^note-3a|meat]] for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|But]] flesh with the [[#^note-4b|life]] thereof, which is the [[#^note-4c|blood]] thereof, shall ye not eat. ^verse-4

**5**  And surely [[#^note-5a|your]] blood of your lives will I [[#^note-5b|require]]; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. ^verse-5

**6**  Whoso [[#^note-6a|sheddeth]] man's [[#^note-6b|blood]], by man shall his blood be shed: for in the [[#^note-6c|image]] of God made he man. ^verse-6

**7**  And you, be ye [[#^note-7a|fruitful]], and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  And [[#^note-9a|I]], behold, I establish my [[#^note-9b|covenant]] with you, and with your seed after you; ^verse-9

**10**  And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a [[#^note-11a|flood]]; neither shall there any more be a flood to [[#^note-11b|destroy]] the [[#^note-11c|earth]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: ^verse-12

**13**  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. ^verse-13

**14**  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: ^verse-14

**15**  And I will remember my [[#^note-15a|covenant]], [[#^note-15b|which is]] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a [[#^note-15c|flood]] to destroy all flesh. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|And]] the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the [[#^note-16b|everlasting covenant]] between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  And God said unto Noah, This is the [[#^note-17a|token]] of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And the [[#^note-18a|sons]] of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. ^verse-18

**19**  These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole [[#^note-19a|earth]] overspread. ^verse-19

**20**  And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: ^verse-20

**21**  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. ^verse-21

**22**  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. ^verse-22

**23**  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. ^verse-23

**24**  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. ^verse-24

**25**  And he said, [[#^note-25a|Cursed]] be [[#^note-25b|Canaan]]; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. ^verse-25

**26**  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his [[#^note-26a|servant]]. ^verse-26

**27**  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. ^verse-28

**29**  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. ^verse-29
