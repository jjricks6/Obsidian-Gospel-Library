*Abimelech desires Sarah, who is preserved by the Lord—Abraham prays for Abimelech, and the Lord blesses him and his household.*

**1**  And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and [[#^note-1a|Shur]], and sojourned in [[#^note-1b|Gerar]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and [[#^note-2a|Abimelech]] king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. ^verse-2

**3**  But [[#^note-3a|God]] came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. ^verse-3

**4**  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also [[#^note-4a|a righteous nation]]? ^verse-4

**5**  Said he not unto me, She is my [[#^note-5a|sister]]? and she, even she herself said, He is my [[#^note-5b|brother]]: in the [[#^note-5c|integrity]] of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. ^verse-5

**6**  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. ^verse-6

**7**  Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall [[#^note-7a|pray]] for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. ^verse-8

**9**  Then [[#^note-9a|Abimelech]] called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou [[#^note-9b|done]] unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast [[#^note-9c|done]] deeds unto me that ought not to be done. ^verse-9

**10**  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? ^verse-10

**11**  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the [[#^note-11a|fear]] of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. ^verse-11

**12**  And yet indeed she is my [[#^note-12a|sister]]; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. ^verse-12

**13**  And it came to pass, when God caused me to [[#^note-13a|wander]] from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy [[#^note-13b|kindness]] which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. ^verse-13

**14**  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. ^verse-14

**15**  And Abimelech said, Behold, my [[#^note-15a|land]] is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. ^verse-15

**16**  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy [[#^note-16a|brother]] a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. ^verse-17

**18**  For the Lord had fast [[#^note-18a|closed]] up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. ^verse-18
