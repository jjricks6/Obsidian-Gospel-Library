*Abraham entertains three holy men—They promise that Sarah will have a son—Abraham will command his children to be just—The Lord appears to him—They discuss the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.*

**1**  And the Lord [[#^note-1a|appeared]] unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; ^verse-1

**2**  And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three [[#^note-2a|men]] stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and [[#^note-2b|bowed]] himself toward the ground, ^verse-2

**3**  And said, My [[#^note-3a|Lord]], if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: ^verse-3

**4**  Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and [[#^note-4a|wash]] your feet, and [[#^note-4b|rest]] yourselves under the tree: ^verse-4

**5**  And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and [[#^note-5a|comfort]] ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye [[#^note-5b|come]] to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. ^verse-5

**6**  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. ^verse-6

**7**  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. ^verse-7

**8**  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. ^verse-9

**10**  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, [[#^note-10a|Sarah]] thy wife shall have a [[#^note-10b|son]]. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. ^verse-10

**11**  Now Abraham and Sarah were [[#^note-11a|old]] and well stricken in age; and it [[#^note-11b|ceased]] to be with Sarah after the manner of women. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed [[#^note-12a|old]] shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? ^verse-12

**13**  And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah [[#^note-13a|laugh]], saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am [[#^note-13b|old]]? ^verse-13

**14**  Is any thing too [[#^note-14a|hard]] for the Lord? At the [[#^note-14b|time]] appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. ^verse-14

**15**  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. ^verse-16

**17**  And the Lord said, Shall I [[#^note-17a|hide]] from Abraham that thing which I do; ^verse-17

**18**  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty [[#^note-18a|nation]], and all the [[#^note-18b|nations]] of the earth shall be [[#^note-18c|blessed]] in him? ^verse-18

**19**  For I [[#^note-19a|know]] him, that he will [[#^note-19b|command]] his [[#^note-19c|children]] and his [[#^note-19d|household]] after him, and they shall [[#^note-19e|keep]] the way of the Lord, to do justice and [[#^note-19f|judgment]]; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. ^verse-19

**20**  And the Lord said, Because the [[#^note-20a|cry]] of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their [[#^note-20b|sin]] is very grievous; ^verse-20

**21**  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will [[#^note-21a|know]]. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|And]] the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham [[#^note-22b|stood]] yet before the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also [[#^note-23a|destroy]] the [[#^note-23b|righteous]] with the [[#^note-23c|wicked]]? ^verse-23

**24**  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not [[#^note-24a|spare]] the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? ^verse-24

**25**  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the [[#^note-25a|Judge]] of all the earth do right? ^verse-25

**26**  And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty [[#^note-26a|righteous]] within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. ^verse-26

**27**  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but [[#^note-27a|dust]] and ashes: ^verse-27

**28**  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. ^verse-28

**29**  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. ^verse-29

**30**  And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. ^verse-30

**31**  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. ^verse-31

**32**  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be [[#^note-32a|angry]], and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will [[#^note-32b|not]] destroy it for ten's sake. ^verse-32

**33**  And the Lord [[#^note-33a|went]] his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. ^verse-33
