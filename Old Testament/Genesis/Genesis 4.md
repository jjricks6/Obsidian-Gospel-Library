[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 5|Next Entry]]

*Eve bears Cain and Abel—They offer sacrifices—Cain slays Abel and is cursed by the Lord, who also sets a mark upon him—The children of men multiply—Adam begets Seth, and Seth begets Enos.*

**1**  And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare [[#^note-1a|Cain]], and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a [[#^note-2a|keeper]] of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. ^verse-2

**3**  And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  And Abel, he also brought of the [[#^note-4a|firstlings]] of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto [[#^note-4b|Abel]] and to his [[#^note-4c|offering]]: ^verse-4

**5**  But unto [[#^note-5a|Cain]] and to his [[#^note-5b|offering]] he had not [[#^note-5c|respect]]. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? ^verse-6

**7**  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be [[#^note-7a|accepted]]? and if thou [[#^note-7b|doest]] not well, [[#^note-7c|sin]] lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be [[#^note-7d|his]] [[#^note-7e|desire]], and thou shalt rule over him. ^verse-7

**8**  And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and [[#^note-8a|slew]] him. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my [[#^note-9a|brother's]] [[#^note-9b|keeper]]? ^verse-9

**10**  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's [[#^note-10a|blood]] crieth unto me from the ground. ^verse-10

**11**  And now art thou [[#^note-11a|cursed]] from the [[#^note-11b|earth]], which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; ^verse-11

**12**  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a [[#^note-12a|fugitive]] and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  And Cain said unto the Lord, [[#^note-13a|My]] punishment is greater than I can bear. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall [[#^note-14a|slay]] me. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a [[#^note-15a|mark]] upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And Cain went out from the [[#^note-16a|presence]] of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of [[#^note-16b|Eden]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And Cain knew his [[#^note-17a|wife]]; and she conceived, and bare [[#^note-17b|Enoch]]: and he builded a city, and called the [[#^note-17c|name]] of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. ^verse-17

**18**  And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. ^verse-19

**20**  And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. ^verse-20

**21**  And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the [[#^note-21a|harp]] and organ. ^verse-21

**22**  And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an [[#^note-22a|instructer]] of every [[#^note-22b|artificer]] in [[#^note-22c|brass]] and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. ^verse-22

**23**  And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have [[#^note-23a|slain]] a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. ^verse-23

**24**  If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly [[#^note-24a|Lamech]] seventy and sevenfold. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name [[#^note-25a|Seth]]: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of [[#^note-25b|Abel]], whom Cain slew. ^verse-25

**26**  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he [[#^note-26a|call]]ed his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the [[#^note-26b|Lord]]. ^verse-26
