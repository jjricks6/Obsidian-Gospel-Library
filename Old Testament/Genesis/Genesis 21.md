*Sarah bears Isaac—He is circumcised—Hagar and her son are cast out of Abraham's household—The Lord saves Hagar and Ishmael—Abraham and Abimelech deal honorably with each other.*

**1**  And the Lord [[#^note-1a|visited]] [[#^note-1b|Sarah]] as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. ^verse-1

**2**  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a [[#^note-2a|son]] in his [[#^note-2b|old]] age, at the set [[#^note-2c|time]] of which God had spoken to him. ^verse-2

**3**  And Abraham called the name of his [[#^note-3a|son]] that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. ^verse-3

**4**  And Abraham [[#^note-4a|circumcised]] his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. ^verse-4

**5**  And Abraham was an [[#^note-5a|hundred]] years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to [[#^note-6a|laugh]], so that all that hear will laugh with me. ^verse-6

**7**  And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his [[#^note-7a|old]] age. ^verse-7

**8**  And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And Sarah saw the son of [[#^note-9a|Hagar]] the Egyptian, which she had [[#^note-9b|born]] unto Abraham, [[#^note-9c|mocking]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, [[#^note-10a|Cast]] out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be [[#^note-10b|heir]] with my son, even with Isaac. ^verse-10

**11**  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his [[#^note-11a|son]]. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in [[#^note-12a|Isaac]] shall thy [[#^note-12b|seed]] be called. ^verse-12

**13**  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a [[#^note-13a|nation]], because he is thy seed. ^verse-13

**14**  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and [[#^note-14a|sent]] her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of [[#^note-14b|Beer-sheba]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. ^verse-15

**16**  And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. ^verse-16

**17**  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the [[#^note-17a|angel]] of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. ^verse-17

**18**  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great [[#^note-18a|nation]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And God [[#^note-19a|opened]] her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. ^verse-19

**20**  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an [[#^note-20a|archer]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a [[#^note-21a|wife]] out of the land of [[#^note-21b|Egypt]]. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that [[#^note-22a|Abimelech]] and [[#^note-22b|Phichol]] the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, [[#^note-22c|God]] is with thee in all that thou doest: ^verse-22

**23**  Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. ^verse-23

**24**  And Abraham said, I will swear. ^verse-24

**25**  And Abraham [[#^note-25a|reproved]] Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants [[#^note-25b|had]] violently taken away. ^verse-25

**26**  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. ^verse-26

**27**  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them [[#^note-27a|made]] a covenant. ^verse-27

**28**  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. ^verse-28

**29**  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? ^verse-29

**30**  And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this [[#^note-30a|well]]. ^verse-30

**31**  Wherefore he called that place [[#^note-31a|Beer-sheba]]; because there they sware both of them. ^verse-31

**32**  Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: [[#^note-32a|then]] Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ And Abraham planted a [[#^note-33a|grove]] in Beer-sheba, and [[#^note-33b|called]] there on the name of the Lord, the [[#^note-33c|everlasting]] God. ^verse-33

**34**  And Abraham sojourned in the [[#^note-34a|Philistines']] land many days. ^verse-34
