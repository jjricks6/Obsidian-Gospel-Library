[[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 47|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Genesis/Genesis 49|Next Entry]]

*Jacob tells of the appearance of God to him in Luz—He adopts Ephraim and Manasseh as his own children—Jacob blesses Joseph—He puts Ephraim before Manasseh—The seed of Ephraim will become a multitude of nations—The children of Israel will come again into the land of their fathers.*

**1**  And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. ^verse-1

**2**  And one told [[#^note-2a|Jacob]], and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel [[#^note-2b|strengthened]] himself, and sat upon the bed. ^verse-2

**3**  And Jacob said unto Joseph, God [[#^note-3a|Almighty]] [[#^note-3b|appeared]] unto me at [[#^note-3c|Luz]] in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, ^verse-3

**4**  And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee [[#^note-4a|fruitful]], and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this [[#^note-4b|land]] to thy seed after thee for an everlasting [[#^note-4c|possession]]. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ [[#^note-5a|And]] now thy two sons, [[#^note-5b|Ephraim]] and [[#^note-5c|Manasseh]], which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. ^verse-5

**6**  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. ^verse-6

**7**  And as for me, when I came from Padan, [[#^note-7a|Rachel]] died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth-lehem. ^verse-7

**8**  And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? ^verse-8

**9**  And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will [[#^note-9a|bless]] them. ^verse-9

**10**  Now the eyes of Israel were [[#^note-10a|dim]] for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them [[#^note-10b|near]] unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. ^verse-10

**11**  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. ^verse-11

**12**  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. ^verse-13

**14**  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon [[#^note-14a|Ephraim's]] head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, [[#^note-14b|guiding his hands]] wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And he blessed [[#^note-15a|Joseph]], and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did [[#^note-15b|walk]], the God which [[#^note-15c|fed]] me all my life long unto this day, ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|Angel]] which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my [[#^note-16b|name]] be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right [[#^note-17a|hand]] upon the head of [[#^note-17b|Ephraim]], [[#^note-17c|it displeased him]]: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. ^verse-17

**18**  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. ^verse-18

**19**  And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be [[#^note-19a|great]]: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his [[#^note-19b|seed]] shall become a [[#^note-19c|multitude]] of [[#^note-19d|nations]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And he blessed them that day, saying, [[#^note-20a|In thee]] shall Israel [[#^note-20b|bless]], saying, God make thee as [[#^note-20c|Ephraim]] and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. ^verse-20

**21**  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but [[#^note-21a|God]] shall be with you, and [[#^note-21b|bring]] you again unto the [[#^note-21c|land]] of your fathers. ^verse-21

**22**  Moreover I have given to thee one [[#^note-22a|portion]] above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. ^verse-22
