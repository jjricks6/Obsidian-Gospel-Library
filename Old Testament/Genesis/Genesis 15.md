*Abram desires offspring—The Lord promises him seed in number as the stars—Abram believes the promise—His seed will be strangers in Egypt—Then, after four generations, they will inherit Canaan.*

**1**  After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a [[#^note-1a|vision]], saying, [[#^note-1b|Fear not]], Abram: I am thy [[#^note-1c|shield]], and thy exceeding great reward. ^verse-1

**2**  And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the [[#^note-2a|steward]] of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? ^verse-2

**3**  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, [[#^note-3a|one]] born in my house is mine heir. ^verse-3

**4**  And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. ^verse-4

**5**  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and [[#^note-5a|tell]] the [[#^note-5b|stars]], if thou be able to [[#^note-5c|number]] them: and he said unto him, So shall thy [[#^note-5d|seed]] be. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|And]] he [[#^note-6b|believed]] in the Lord; and he counted it to him for [[#^note-6c|righteousness]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to [[#^note-7a|inherit]] it. ^verse-7

**8**  And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I [[#^note-8a|know]] that I shall inherit it? ^verse-8

**9**  And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. ^verse-9

**10**  And he took unto him all these, and [[#^note-10a|divided]] them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. ^verse-10

**11**  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. ^verse-11

**12**  And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great [[#^note-12a|darkness]] fell upon him. ^verse-12

**13**  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a [[#^note-13a|stranger]] in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall [[#^note-13b|afflict]] them four hundred years; ^verse-13

**14**  And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they [[#^note-14a|come]] out with great [[#^note-14b|substance]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good [[#^note-15a|old]] age. ^verse-15

**16**  But in the [[#^note-16a|fourth]] generation they shall come [[#^note-16b|hither]] again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet [[#^note-16c|full]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that [[#^note-17a|passed]] between those pieces. ^verse-17

**18**  In the same day the Lord made a [[#^note-18a|covenant]] with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this [[#^note-18b|land]], from [[#^note-18c|the river of Egypt]] unto the great river, the river [[#^note-18d|Euphrates]]: ^verse-18

**19**  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, ^verse-19

**20**  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, ^verse-20

**21**  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. ^verse-21
