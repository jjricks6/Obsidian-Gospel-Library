*Egypt and its helpers will be made desolate by Babylon.*

**1**  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye, [[#^note-2a|Woe worth the day]]! ^verse-2

**3**  For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is near, a [[#^note-3a|cloudy]] day; it shall be the time of the heathen. ^verse-3

**4**  And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in [[#^note-4a|Ethiopia]], when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Ethiopia]], and [[#^note-5b|Libya]], and [[#^note-5c|Lydia]], and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. ^verse-5

**6**  Thus saith the Lord; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: [[#^note-6a|from]] the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord God. ^verse-6

**7**  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. ^verse-7

**8**  And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed. ^verse-8

**9**  In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless [[#^note-9a|Ethiopians]] afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh. ^verse-9

**10**  Thus saith the Lord God; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. ^verse-10

**11**  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their [[#^note-11a|swords]] against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will make the rivers [[#^note-12a|dry]], and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it. ^verse-12

**13**  Thus saith the Lord God; I will also destroy the [[#^note-13a|idols]], and I will cause their images to cease out of [[#^note-13b|Noph]]; and there shall be no more a [[#^note-13c|prince]] of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in [[#^note-14a|No]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. ^verse-15

**16**  And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily. ^verse-16

**17**  The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity. ^verse-17

**18**  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. ^verse-18

**19**  Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-19

**20**  Â¶ And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-20

**21**  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a [[#^note-21a|roller]] to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. ^verse-21

**22**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. ^verse-22

**23**  And I will [[#^note-23a|scatter]] the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. ^verse-23

**24**  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. ^verse-24

**25**  But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. ^verse-25

**26**  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-26
