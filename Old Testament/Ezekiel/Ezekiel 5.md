*The judgment of Jerusalem will include famine, pestilence, war, and the scattering of her inhabitants.*

**1**  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a [[#^note-2a|sword]] after them. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. ^verse-3

**4**  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the [[#^note-5a|midst]] of the nations and countries that are round about her. ^verse-5

**6**  And she hath changed my judgments into [[#^note-6a|wickedness]] more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have [[#^note-6b|refused]] my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my [[#^note-7a|judgments]], neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you; ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the [[#^note-8a|sight]] of the nations. ^verse-8

**9**  And I will do in thee that which I have not [[#^note-9a|done]], and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine [[#^note-9b|abominations]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore the fathers shall [[#^note-10a|eat]] the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I [[#^note-10b|scatter]] into all the winds. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord God; Surely, because thou hast [[#^note-11a|defiled]] my sanctuary with all thy [[#^note-11b|detestable]] things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also [[#^note-11c|diminish]] thee; neither shall mine eye [[#^note-11d|spare]], neither will I have any pity. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them. ^verse-12

**13**  Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and [[#^note-13a|I]] will cause my [[#^note-13b|fury]] to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have [[#^note-13c|spoken]] it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. ^verse-13

**14**  Moreover I will make thee [[#^note-14a|waste]], and a [[#^note-14b|reproach]] among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that [[#^note-14c|pass]] by. ^verse-14

**15**  So it shall be a [[#^note-15a|reproach]] and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the Lord have spoken it. ^verse-15

**16**  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: ^verse-16

**17**  So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall [[#^note-17a|bereave thee]]; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the [[#^note-17b|sword]] upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it. ^verse-17
