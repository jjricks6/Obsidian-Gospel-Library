*Tyre and Sidon will fall and be destroyed—The Lord will gather the people of Israel to their own land—They will then dwell safely.*

**1**  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God; Because thine [[#^note-2a|heart]] is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a [[#^note-2b|man]], and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, thou art wiser than [[#^note-3a|Daniel]]; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: ^verse-3

**4**  With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: ^verse-4

**5**  By thy great [[#^note-5a|wisdom]] and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their [[#^note-7a|swords]] against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. ^verse-7

**8**  They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. ^verse-8

**9**  Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-11

**12**  Son of man, take up a [[#^note-12a|lamentation]] upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in [[#^note-12b|beauty]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou hast been in [[#^note-13a|Eden]] the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou art the anointed [[#^note-14a|cherub]] that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. ^verse-15

**16**  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. ^verse-16

**17**  Thine [[#^note-17a|heart]] was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. ^verse-17

**18**  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy [[#^note-18a|traffick]]; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. ^verse-18

**19**  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-20

**21**  Son of man, set thy face against [[#^note-21a|Zidon]], and prophesy against it, ^verse-21

**22**  And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. ^verse-22

**23**  For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall [[#^note-23a|be judged]] in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And there shall be no more a [[#^note-24a|pricking]] brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord God. ^verse-24

**25**  Thus saith the Lord God; When I shall have [[#^note-25a|gathered]] the house of [[#^note-25b|Israel]] from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the [[#^note-25c|heathen]], then shall they dwell in their [[#^note-25d|land]] that I have given to my servant Jacob. ^verse-25

**26**  And they shall dwell [[#^note-26a|safely]] therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell [[#^note-26b|with confidence]], when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God. ^verse-26
