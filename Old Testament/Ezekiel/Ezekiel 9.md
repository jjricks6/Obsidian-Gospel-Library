*Ezekiel sees the marking of the righteous and the slaughter of all others, beginning at the Lord's sanctuary.*

**1**  He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher [[#^note-2a|gate]], which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was [[#^note-2b|clothed]] with linen, with a [[#^note-2c|writer's]] [[#^note-2d|inkhorn]] by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen [[#^note-2e|altar]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the [[#^note-3a|cherub]], whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; ^verse-3

**4**  And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the [[#^note-4a|foreheads]] of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: ^verse-5

**6**  Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and [[#^note-6a|begin]] at my sanctuary. Then they began at the [[#^note-6b|ancient men]] which were before the house. ^verse-6

**7**  And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord God! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? ^verse-8

**9**  Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord [[#^note-9a|seeth]] not. ^verse-9

**10**  And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will [[#^note-10a|recompense]] their way upon their head. ^verse-10

**11**  And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me. ^verse-11
