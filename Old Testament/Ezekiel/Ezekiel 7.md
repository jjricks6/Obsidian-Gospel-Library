*Desolation, war, pestilence, and destruction will sweep the land of Israel—The desolation of the people is foreseen.*

**1**  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God unto the land of Israel; An [[#^note-2a|end]], the end is come upon the four corners of the land. ^verse-2

**3**  Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will [[#^note-3a|judge]] thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. ^verse-3

**4**  And mine eye shall not [[#^note-4a|spare]] thee, neither will I have pity: but I will [[#^note-4b|recompense]] thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall [[#^note-4c|know]] that I am the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Thus saith the Lord God; An evil, an [[#^note-5a|only]] evil, behold, is [[#^note-5b|come]]. ^verse-5

**6**  An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. ^verse-6

**7**  The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. ^verse-7

**8**  Now will I shortly pour out my [[#^note-8a|fury]] upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. ^verse-8

**9**  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. ^verse-10

**11**  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be [[#^note-11a|wailing]] for them. ^verse-11

**12**  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the [[#^note-12a|buyer]] rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. ^verse-13

**14**  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|sword]] is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ But they that [[#^note-16a|escape]] of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them [[#^note-16b|mourning]], every one for his iniquity. ^verse-16

**17**  All [[#^note-17a|hands]] shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. ^verse-17

**18**  They shall also gird themselves with [[#^note-18a|sackcloth]], and horror shall cover them; and [[#^note-18b|shame]] shall be upon all faces, and [[#^note-18c|baldness]] upon all their heads. ^verse-18

**19**  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the [[#^note-19a|stumblingblock]] of their [[#^note-19b|iniquity]]. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the [[#^note-20a|images]] of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. ^verse-20

**21**  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall [[#^note-21a|pollute]] it. ^verse-21

**22**  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall [[#^note-22a|pollute]] my secret [[#^note-22b|place]]: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Make a chain: for the land is full of [[#^note-23a|bloody crimes]], and the city is full of violence. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. ^verse-24

**25**  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|Mischief]] shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the [[#^note-26b|law]] shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the [[#^note-26c|ancients]]. ^verse-26

**27**  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall [[#^note-27a|know]] that I am the Lord. ^verse-27
