*The Lord's vengeance will fall on the Ammonites, on the Moabites and Edomites, and on the Philistines.*

**1**  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, set thy face against the [[#^note-2a|Ammonites]], and prophesy against them; ^verse-2

**3**  And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord God; Thus saith the Lord God; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. ^verse-4

**5**  And I will make [[#^note-5a|Rabbah]] a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  For thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy [[#^note-6a|despite]] against the land of Israel; ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because that [[#^note-8a|Moab]] and [[#^note-8b|Seir]] do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the [[#^note-8c|heathen]]; ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, [[#^note-9a|Beth-jeshimoth]], [[#^note-9b|Baal-meon]], and Kiriathaim, ^verse-9

**10**  Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because that [[#^note-12a|Edom]] hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; I will also stretch out mine hand upon [[#^note-13a|Edom]], and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it [[#^note-13b|desolate]] from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will lay my vengeance upon [[#^note-14a|Edom]] by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because the [[#^note-15a|Philistines]] have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred; ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the [[#^note-16a|sea]] coast. ^verse-16

**17**  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. ^verse-17
