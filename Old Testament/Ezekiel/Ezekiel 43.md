*The glory of God fills the temple—His throne is there, and He promises to dwell in the midst of Israel forever—Ezekiel sees the altar and the ordinances of the altar.*

**1**  Afterward he brought me to the [[#^note-1a|gate]], even the gate that [[#^note-1b|looketh]] toward the east: ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, the [[#^note-2a|glory]] of the God of Israel came from the way of the [[#^note-2b|east]]: and his [[#^note-2c|voice]] was like a noise of many [[#^note-2d|waters]]: and the earth [[#^note-2e|shined]] with his [[#^note-2f|glory]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And it was according to the appearance of the [[#^note-3a|vision]] which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. ^verse-3

**4**  And the glory of the Lord [[#^note-4a|came]] into the [[#^note-4b|house]] by the way of the gate [[#^note-4c|whose prospect is]] toward the east. ^verse-4

**5**  So the [[#^note-5a|spirit]] took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the [[#^note-5b|glory]] of the Lord filled the house. ^verse-5

**6**  And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my [[#^note-7a|feet]], where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more [[#^note-7b|defile]], neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. ^verse-7

**8**  In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy [[#^note-8a|name]] by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. ^verse-8

**9**  Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Thou son of man, [[#^note-10a|shew]] the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the [[#^note-10b|pattern]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the [[#^note-11a|house]], and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the [[#^note-11b|ordinances]] thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. ^verse-11

**12**  This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the [[#^note-12a|mountain]] the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And these are the measures of the altar after the [[#^note-13a|cubit]]s: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar. ^verse-13

**14**  And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower [[#^note-14a|settle]] shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. ^verse-14

**15**  So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns. ^verse-15

**16**  And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. ^verse-16

**17**  And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord God; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to [[#^note-18a|sprinkle]] blood thereon. ^verse-18

**19**  And thou shalt give to the [[#^note-19a|priests]] the Levites that be of the seed of [[#^note-19b|Zadok]], which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord God, a young [[#^note-19c|bullock]] for a [[#^note-19d|sin offering]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns [[#^note-20a|of it]], and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou shalt take t[[#^note-21a|he]] bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall [[#^note-21b|burn]] it in the appointed place of the house, [[#^note-21c|without the sanctuary]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. ^verse-22

**23**  When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. ^verse-23

**24**  And thou shalt offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall cast [[#^note-24a|salt]] upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Seven]] days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. ^verse-25

**26**  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. ^verse-26

**27**  And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the [[#^note-27a|eighth]] day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt [[#^note-27b|offerings]] upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord God. ^verse-27
