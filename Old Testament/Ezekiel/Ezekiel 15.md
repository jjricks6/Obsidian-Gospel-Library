*Jerusalem, as a useless vine, will be burned.*

**1**  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? ^verse-2

**3**  Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? ^verse-5

**6**  Â¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the [[#^note-6a|vine]] tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of [[#^note-6b|Jerusalem]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them. ^verse-7

**8**  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord God. ^verse-8
