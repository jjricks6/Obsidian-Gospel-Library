*Both the righteous and the wicked in Jerusalem will be slain—Babylon will draw a sharp and bright sword against Israel and will prevail.*

**1**  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, set thy [[#^note-2a|face]] toward Jerusalem, and [[#^note-2b|drop thy word toward]] the holy places, and prophesy against the [[#^note-2c|land of Israel]], ^verse-2

**3**  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my [[#^note-3a|sword]] out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. ^verse-3

**4**  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: ^verse-4

**5**  That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not [[#^note-5a|return]] any more. ^verse-5

**6**  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes. ^verse-6

**7**  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all [[#^note-7a|hands]] shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord God. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also [[#^note-9a|furbished]]: ^verse-9

**10**  It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree. ^verse-10

**11**  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be [[#^note-11a|handled]]: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. ^verse-11

**12**  Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh. ^verse-12

**13**  Because it is a [[#^note-13a|trial]], and what if the sword [[#^note-13b|contemn]] even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord God. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. ^verse-14

**15**  I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter. ^verse-15

**16**  Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set. ^verse-16

**17**  I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my [[#^note-17a|fury]] to rest: I the Lord have said it. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, ^verse-18

**19**  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city. ^verse-19

**20**  Appoint a way, that the sword may come to [[#^note-20a|Rabbath]] of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. ^verse-20

**21**  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. ^verse-21

**22**  At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [[#^note-22a|battering]] rams against the gates, to cast [[#^note-22b|a mount]], and to build [[#^note-22c|a fort]]. ^verse-22

**23**  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be [[#^note-23a|taken]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your [[#^note-24a|transgressions]] are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be [[#^note-24b|taken with the hand]]. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And thou, profane [[#^note-25a|wicked]] prince of Israel, whose [[#^note-25b|day]] is come, when iniquity shall have an end, ^verse-25

**26**  Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the [[#^note-26a|diadem]], and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is [[#^note-26b|low]], and abase him that is high. ^verse-26

**27**  I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he [[#^note-27a|come]] [[#^note-27b|whose]] [[#^note-27c|right]] it is; and I will give it him. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God concerning the [[#^note-28a|Ammonites]], and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is [[#^note-28b|furbished]], to consume because of the glittering: ^verse-28

**29**  [[#^note-29a|Whiles]] they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end. ^verse-29

**30**  Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. ^verse-30

**31**  And I will pour out mine [[#^note-31a|indignation]] upon thee, I will blow against thee in the [[#^note-31b|fire]] of my [[#^note-31c|wrath]], and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy. ^verse-31

**32**  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the Lord have spoken it. ^verse-32
