*Ezekiel is made a watchman unto the house of Israel—The blood of Israel is required at his hand unless he raises the warning voice.*

**1**  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this [[#^note-1a|roll]], and go speak unto the house of Israel. ^verse-1

**2**  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to [[#^note-3a|eat]], and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; ^verse-5

**6**  Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have [[#^note-6a|hearkened]] unto thee. ^verse-6

**7**  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and [[#^note-7a|hardhearted]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. ^verse-8

**9**  As an [[#^note-9a|adamant]] harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. ^verse-9

**10**  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. ^verse-10

**11**  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith [[#^note-11a|the Lord God]]; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. ^verse-11

**12**  Then the [[#^note-12a|spirit]] took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. ^verse-12

**13**  I heard also the [[#^note-13a|noise]] of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. ^verse-13

**14**  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. ^verse-15

**16**  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-16

**17**  Son of man, I have made thee a [[#^note-17a|watchman]] unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them [[#^note-17b|warning]] from me. ^verse-17

**18**  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely [[#^note-18a|die]]; and thou givest him not [[#^note-18b|warning]], nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall [[#^note-18c|die]] in his [[#^note-18d|iniquity]]; but his blood will I [[#^note-18e|require]] at thine hand. ^verse-18

**19**  Yet if thou [[#^note-19a|warn]] the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. ^verse-19

**20**  Again, When a [[#^note-20a|righteous]] man doth [[#^note-20b|turn]] from his [[#^note-20c|righteousness]], and commit iniquity, and I lay a [[#^note-20d|stumblingblock]] before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. ^verse-20

**21**  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is [[#^note-21a|warned]]; also thou hast delivered thy soul. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the [[#^note-22a|plain]], and I will there talk with thee. ^verse-22

**23**  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I [[#^note-23a|fell]] on my face. ^verse-23

**24**  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. ^verse-24

**25**  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: ^verse-25

**26**  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be [[#^note-26a|dumb]], and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. ^verse-26

**27**  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy [[#^note-27a|mouth]], and thou shalt say unto them, Thus [[#^note-27b|saith]] the Lord God; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. ^verse-27
