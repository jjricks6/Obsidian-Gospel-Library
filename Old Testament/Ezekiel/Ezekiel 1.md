[[Old Testament/Ezekiel|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 2|Next Entry]]

*Ezekiel sees in vision four living creatures, four wheels, and the glory of God on His throne.*

**1**  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the [[#^note-1a|captives]] by the river of [[#^note-1b|Chebar]], that the heavens were [[#^note-1c|opened]], and I saw [[#^note-1d|visions]] of God. ^verse-1

**2**  In the [[#^note-2a|fifth]] day of the month, which was the fifth year of king [[#^note-2b|Jehoiachin's]] captivity, ^verse-2

**3**  The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the [[#^note-3a|hand]] of the Lord was there upon him. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a [[#^note-4a|whirlwind]] came out of the north, a great cloud, and a [[#^note-4b|fire infolding itself]], and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. ^verse-4

**5**  Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living [[#^note-5a|creatures]]. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. ^verse-5

**6**  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. ^verse-6

**7**  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished [[#^note-7a|brass]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. ^verse-8

**9**  Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one [[#^note-9a|straight]] forward. ^verse-9

**10**  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. ^verse-10

**11**  Thus were their faces: and their [[#^note-11a|wings]] were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. ^verse-11

**12**  And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. ^verse-12

**13**  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of [[#^note-13a|lamps]]: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. ^verse-13

**14**  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one [[#^note-15a|wheel]] upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. ^verse-15

**16**  The appearance of the [[#^note-16a|wheels]] and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. ^verse-16

**17**  When they [[#^note-17a|went]], they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. ^verse-17

**18**  As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. ^verse-18

**19**  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. ^verse-19

**20**  Whithersoever the [[#^note-20a|spirit]] was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. ^verse-20

**21**  When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. ^verse-21

**22**  And the likeness of the [[#^note-22a|firmament upon]] the heads of the [[#^note-22b|living]] creature was as the [[#^note-22c|colour]] of the terrible [[#^note-22d|crystal]], stretched forth over their heads above. ^verse-22

**23**  And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. ^verse-23

**24**  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the [[#^note-24a|voice]] of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. ^verse-24

**25**  And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a [[#^note-26a|throne]], as the [[#^note-26b|appearance]] of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. ^verse-26

**27**  And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of [[#^note-27a|fire]] round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. ^verse-27

**28**  As the appearance of the [[#^note-28a|bow]] that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the [[#^note-28b|appearance]] of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the [[#^note-28c|glory]] of the [[#^note-28d|Lord]]. And when I saw it, I [[#^note-28e|fell]] upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. ^verse-28
