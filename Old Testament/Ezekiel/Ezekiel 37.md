[[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 36|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 38|Next Entry]]

*Ezekiel is shown the valley of dry bones—Israel will inherit the land in the Resurrection—The stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) will become one in the Lord's hand—The children of Israel will be gathered and cleansed—David (the Messiah) will reign over them—They will receive the everlasting gospel covenant.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|hand]] of the Lord was upon me, and [[#^note-1b|carried]] me out in the [[#^note-1c|spirit]] of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, ^verse-1

**2**  And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones [[#^note-3a|live]]? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. ^verse-3

**4**  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause [[#^note-5a|breath]] to enter into you, and ye shall live: ^verse-5

**6**  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the [[#^note-7a|bone]]s came together, bone to his bone. ^verse-7

**8**  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. ^verse-8

**9**  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the [[#^note-9a|wind]], prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four [[#^note-9b|winds]], O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. ^verse-9

**10**  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the [[#^note-10a|breath]] came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is [[#^note-11a|lost]]: we are cut off for our parts. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O my people, I will open your [[#^note-12a|graves]], and cause you to [[#^note-12b|come]] up out of your graves, and [[#^note-12c|bring]] you into the [[#^note-12d|land of Israel]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, ^verse-13

**14**  And shall put my [[#^note-14a|spirit]] in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, ^verse-15

**16**    Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one [[#^note-16a|stick]], and [[#^note-16b|write]] upon it, For [[#^note-16c|Judah]], and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and [[#^note-16d|write]] upon it, For [[#^note-16e|Joseph]], the [[#^note-16f|stick]] of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: ^verse-16

**17**  And join them [[#^note-17a|one]] to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us [[#^note-18a|what]] thou meanest by these? ^verse-18

**19**  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of [[#^note-19a|Joseph]], which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. ^verse-20

**21**  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the [[#^note-21a|heathen]], whither they be gone, and will [[#^note-21b|gather]] them on every side, and bring them into their own land: ^verse-21

**22**  And I will make them [[#^note-22a|one]] [[#^note-22b|nation]] in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and [[#^note-22c|one]] king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more [[#^note-22d|two]] nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: ^verse-22

**23**  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their [[#^note-23a|idols]], nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will [[#^note-23b|save]] them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will [[#^note-23c|cleanse]] them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. ^verse-23

**24**  And [[#^note-24a|David]] my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one [[#^note-24b|shepherd]]: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. ^verse-24

**25**  And they shall dwell in the [[#^note-25a|land]] that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for [[#^note-25b|ever]]: and my servant David shall be their [[#^note-25c|prince]] for ever. ^verse-25

**26**  Moreover I will make a [[#^note-26a|covenant]] of peace with them; it shall be an [[#^note-26b|everlasting]] [[#^note-26c|covenant]] with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my [[#^note-26d|sanctuary]] in the midst of them for evermore. ^verse-26

**27**  My [[#^note-27a|tabernacle]] also shall be with them: yea, I will be their [[#^note-27b|God]], and they shall be my people. ^verse-27

**28**  And the [[#^note-28a|heathen]] shall [[#^note-28b|know]] that I the Lord do [[#^note-28c|sanctify]] Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. ^verse-28
