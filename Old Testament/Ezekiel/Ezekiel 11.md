*He sees in vision the destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of the Jews—He prophesies the latter-day gathering of Israel.*

**1**  Moreover the [[#^note-1a|spirit]] lifted me up, and brought me unto the [[#^note-1b|east gate]] of the Lord's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, [[#^note-1c|princes]] of the people. ^verse-1

**2**  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: ^verse-2

**3**  Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. ^verse-4

**5**  And the [[#^note-5a|Spirit]] of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I [[#^note-5b|know]] the things that come into your [[#^note-5c|mind]], every one of them. ^verse-5

**6**  Ye have multiplied your [[#^note-6a|slain]] in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. ^verse-7

**8**  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord God. ^verse-8

**9**  And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of [[#^note-9a|strangers]], and will execute judgments among you. ^verse-9

**10**  Ye shall [[#^note-10a|fall]] by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel: ^verse-11

**12**  And ye shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my [[#^note-12a|judgments]], but have done after the [[#^note-12b|manners]] of the [[#^note-12c|heathen]] that are round about you. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord God! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? ^verse-13

**14**  Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-14

**15**  Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, [[#^note-15a|the men]] of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: unto us is this land given in possession. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little [[#^note-16a|sanctuary]] in the countries where they shall come. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; I will even [[#^note-17a|gather]] you from the [[#^note-17b|people]], and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the [[#^note-17c|land of Israel]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will [[#^note-19a|give]] them one [[#^note-19b|heart]], and I will put a [[#^note-19c|new]] [[#^note-19d|spirit]] within you; and I will take the stony [[#^note-19e|heart]] out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: ^verse-19

**20**  That they may [[#^note-20a|walk]] in my statutes, and keep mine [[#^note-20b|ordinances]], and do them: and they shall be my [[#^note-20c|people]], and I will be their God. ^verse-20

**21**  But as for them whose heart [[#^note-21a|walketh]] after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will [[#^note-21b|recompense]] their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord God. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the [[#^note-22a|glory]] of the God of Israel was over them above. ^verse-22

**23**  And the [[#^note-23a|glory]] of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Afterwards the [[#^note-24a|spirit]] took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. ^verse-24

**25**  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shewed me. ^verse-25
