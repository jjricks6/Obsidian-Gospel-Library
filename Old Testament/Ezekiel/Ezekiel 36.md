[[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 35|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 37|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, all the house of Israel will be gathered to their own lands—The Lord will give them a new heart and a new spirit—They will have His gospel law.*

**1**  Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the [[#^note-1a|mountains]] of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: ^verse-1

**2**  Thus saith the Lord God; Because the [[#^note-2a|enemy]] hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in [[#^note-2b|possession]]: ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the [[#^note-4a|rivers]], and to the valleys, to the desolate [[#^note-4b|wastes]], and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and [[#^note-4c|derision]] to the residue of the heathen that are round about; ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Surely in the fire of my [[#^note-5a|jealousy]] have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all [[#^note-5b|Idumea]], which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. ^verse-5

**6**  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the [[#^note-6a|shame]] of the heathen: ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your [[#^note-8a|branches]], and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are [[#^note-8b|at]] hand to come. ^verse-8

**9**  For, behold, I am for you, and I will [[#^note-9a|turn]] unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown: ^verse-9

**10**  And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be [[#^note-10a|inhabited]], and the [[#^note-10b|wastes]] shall be [[#^note-10c|builded]]: ^verse-10

**11**  And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old [[#^note-11a|estates]], and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall [[#^note-12a|possess]] thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men. ^verse-12

**13**  Thus saith the Lord God; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast [[#^note-13a|bereaved]] thy nations; ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord God. ^verse-14

**15**  Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord God. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-16

**17**  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they [[#^note-17a|defiled]] it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the [[#^note-17b|uncleanness]] of a removed woman. ^verse-17

**18**  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had [[#^note-18a|shed]] upon the land, and for their [[#^note-18b|idols]] wherewith they had [[#^note-18c|polluted]] it: ^verse-18

**19**  And I [[#^note-19a|scattered]] them among the [[#^note-19b|heathen]], and they were [[#^note-19c|dispersed]] through the countries: [[#^note-19d|according]] to their way and according to their doings I judged them. ^verse-19

**20**  And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they [[#^note-20a|profaned]] my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth [[#^note-20b|out of his land]]. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ But I had [[#^note-21a|pity]] for mine holy [[#^note-21b|name]], which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. ^verse-21

**22**  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your [[#^note-22a|sakes]], O house of Israel, but for mine holy [[#^note-22b|name's]] sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. ^verse-22

**23**  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the [[#^note-23a|heathen]], which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be [[#^note-23b|sanctified]] in you before their eyes. ^verse-23

**24**  For I will take you from among the heathen, and [[#^note-24a|gather]] you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own [[#^note-24b|land]]. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ Then will I [[#^note-25a|sprinkle]] clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your [[#^note-25b|filthiness]], and from all your [[#^note-25c|idols]], will I cleanse you. ^verse-25

**26**  A [[#^note-26a|new]] [[#^note-26b|heart]] also will I [[#^note-26c|give]] you, and a new [[#^note-26d|spirit]] will I put within you: and I will take away the stony [[#^note-26e|heart]] out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. ^verse-26

**27**  And I will put my [[#^note-27a|spirit]] within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. ^verse-27

**28**  And ye shall dwell in the [[#^note-28a|land]] that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. ^verse-28

**29**  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will [[#^note-29a|call for the corn]], and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. ^verse-29

**30**  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. ^verse-30

**31**  Then shall ye [[#^note-31a|remember]] your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your [[#^note-31b|iniquities]] and for your abominations. ^verse-31

**32**  Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. ^verse-32

**33**  Thus saith the Lord God; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. ^verse-33

**34**  And the [[#^note-34a|desolate]] land shall be [[#^note-34b|tilled]], whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. ^verse-34

**35**  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the [[#^note-35a|garden]] of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become [[#^note-35b|fenced]], and are inhabited. ^verse-35

**36**  Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord [[#^note-36a|build]] the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the Lord have spoken it, and I will [[#^note-36b|do]] it. ^verse-36

**37**  Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be [[#^note-37a|inquired]] of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. ^verse-37

**38**  As the [[#^note-38a|holy flock]], as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-38
