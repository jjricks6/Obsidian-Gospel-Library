*Ezekiel sees in the temple the chambers for the priests.*

**1**  Then he brought me forth into the [[#^note-1a|utter court]], the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was [[#^note-1b|over against]] the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. ^verse-1

**2**  Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Over against]] the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was [[#^note-3b|gallery]] against gallery in three stories. ^verse-3

**4**  And before the [[#^note-4a|chambers]] was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. ^verse-4

**5**  Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. ^verse-5

**6**  For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. ^verse-6

**7**  And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the [[#^note-7a|utter]] court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. ^verse-7

**8**  For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an [[#^note-8a|hundred]] cubits. ^verse-8

**9**  And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. ^verse-9

**10**  The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. ^verse-10

**11**  And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. ^verse-11

**12**  And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the [[#^note-13a|priests]] that approach unto the Lord shall [[#^note-13b|eat]] the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the [[#^note-13c|meat offering]], and the [[#^note-13d|sin offering]], and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. ^verse-13

**14**  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their [[#^note-14a|garments]] wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people. ^verse-14

**15**  Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the [[#^note-15a|gate]] whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. ^verse-15

**16**  He measured the east side with the [[#^note-16a|measuring]] reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. ^verse-16

**17**  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. ^verse-17

**18**  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. ^verse-19

**20**  He [[#^note-20a|measured]] it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, [[#^note-20b|five]] hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the [[#^note-20c|profane]] place. ^verse-20
