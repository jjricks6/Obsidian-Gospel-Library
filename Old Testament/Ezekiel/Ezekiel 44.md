[[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 43|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel 45|Next Entry]]

*The glory of the Lord fills the house of the Lord—No strangers may enter the sanctuary—The services of the priests in the temple are explained.*

**1**  Then he brought me back the way of the [[#^note-1a|gate]] of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. ^verse-1

**2**  Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath [[#^note-2a|entered]] in by it, therefore it shall be shut. ^verse-2

**3**  It is for the [[#^note-3a|prince]]; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat [[#^note-3b|bread]] before the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Then brought he me the way of the [[#^note-4a|north]] gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the [[#^note-4b|glory]] of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I [[#^note-4c|fell]] upon my face. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. ^verse-5

**6**  And thou shalt say to the [[#^note-6a|rebellious]], even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, ^verse-6

**7**  In that ye have brought into my sanctuary [[#^note-7a|strangers]], uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to [[#^note-7b|pollute]] it, even my house, when ye offer my [[#^note-7c|bread]], the [[#^note-7d|fat]] and the [[#^note-7e|blood]], and they have broken my [[#^note-7f|covenant]] because of all your abominations. ^verse-7

**8**  And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; No stranger, [[#^note-9a|uncircumcised]] in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel. ^verse-9

**10**  And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their [[#^note-10a|iniquity]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Yet they shall be ministers in my [[#^note-11a|sanctuary]], having charge at the gates of the house, and [[#^note-11b|ministering]] to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. ^verse-11

**12**  Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity. ^verse-12

**13**  And they shall not come [[#^note-13a|near]] unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most [[#^note-13b|holy place]]: but they shall bear their [[#^note-13c|shame]], and their abominations which they have committed. ^verse-13

**14**  But I will make them [[#^note-14a|keepers]] of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ But the [[#^note-15a|priests]] the [[#^note-15b|Levites]], the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall [[#^note-15c|come]] near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God: ^verse-15

**16**  They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my [[#^note-16a|table]], to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And it shall come to pass, that when they [[#^note-17a|enter]] in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with [[#^note-17b|linen]] garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. ^verse-17

**18**  They shall have linen [[#^note-18a|bonnets]] upon their heads, and shall have linen [[#^note-18b|breeches]] upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. ^verse-18

**19**  And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their [[#^note-19a|garments]] wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments. ^verse-19

**20**  Neither shall they [[#^note-20a|shave]] their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only [[#^note-20b|poll]] their heads. ^verse-20

**21**  Neither shall any [[#^note-21a|priest]] drink [[#^note-21b|wine]], when they enter into the inner court. ^verse-21

**22**  Neither shall they take for their wives a [[#^note-22a|widow]], nor her that is [[#^note-22b|put away]]: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. ^verse-22

**23**  And they shall [[#^note-23a|teach]] my people the [[#^note-23b|difference]] between the [[#^note-23c|holy]] and profane, and cause them to discern between the [[#^note-23d|unclean]] and the clean. ^verse-23

**24**  And in [[#^note-24a|controversy]] they shall stand in judgment; and they shall [[#^note-24b|judge]] it according to my [[#^note-24c|judgments]]: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine [[#^note-24d|assemblies]]; and they shall hallow my [[#^note-24e|sabbaths]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And they shall come at no [[#^note-25a|dead]] person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. ^verse-25

**26**  And after he is [[#^note-26a|cleansed]], they shall reckon unto him seven days. ^verse-26

**27**  And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord God. ^verse-27

**28**  And [[#^note-28a|it]] shall be unto them for an [[#^note-28b|inheritance]]: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. ^verse-28

**29**  They shall eat the [[#^note-29a|meat]] offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. ^verse-29

**30**  And the first of all the [[#^note-30a|firstfruits]] of all things, and every [[#^note-30b|oblation]] of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your [[#^note-30c|dough]], that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house. ^verse-30

**31**  The priests shall not eat of any thing that is [[#^note-31a|dead]] of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast. ^verse-31
