*Ezekiel is called to take the word of the Lord to Israel—He sees a book in which lamentations and mourning are written.*

**1**  And he said unto me, [[#^note-1a|Son of man]], stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|spirit]] entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said unto me, Son of man, I [[#^note-3a|send]] thee to the children of Israel, to a [[#^note-3b|rebellious]] nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. ^verse-3

**4**  For they are impudent children and [[#^note-4a|stiffhearted]]. I do [[#^note-4b|send]] thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God. ^verse-4

**5**  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a [[#^note-5a|rebellious]] house,) [[#^note-5b|yet]] shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And thou, son of man, [[#^note-6a|be]] not [[#^note-6b|afraid]] of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost [[#^note-6c|dwell]] among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. ^verse-6

**7**  And thou shalt [[#^note-7a|speak]] my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. ^verse-7

**8**  But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and [[#^note-8a|eat]] that I give thee. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a [[#^note-9a|roll]] of a [[#^note-9b|book]] was therein; ^verse-9

**10**  And he spread it before me; and it was written [[#^note-10a|within and without]]: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. ^verse-10

1a. The expression "son of man" used in Ezekiel refers only to this prophet. As a Hebrew idiom it means simply "human." It is not to be confused with the title "Son of Man," which refers to Christ. ^note-1a
