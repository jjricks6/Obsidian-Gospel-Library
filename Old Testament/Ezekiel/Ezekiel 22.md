*Ezekiel catalogs the sins of the people of Judah in Jerusalem—They will be scattered and destroyed for their iniquities.*

**1**  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. ^verse-2

**3**  Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord God, The city [[#^note-3a|sheddeth]] [[#^note-3b|blood]] in the midst of it, that her [[#^note-3c|time]] may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a [[#^note-4a|reproach]] unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. ^verse-4

**5**  Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. ^verse-6

**7**  In thee have they [[#^note-7a|set light by]] [[#^note-7b|father]] and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by [[#^note-7c|oppression]] with the [[#^note-7d|stranger]]: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the [[#^note-7e|widow]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. ^verse-8

**9**  In thee are men that [[#^note-9a|carry tales to]] shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit [[#^note-9b|lewdness]]. ^verse-9

**10**  In thee have they discovered their fathers' [[#^note-10a|nakedness]]: in thee have they [[#^note-10b|humbled]] her that was set [[#^note-10c|apart]] for [[#^note-10d|pollution]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. ^verse-11

**12**  In thee have they taken [[#^note-12a|gifts]] to shed blood; thou hast taken [[#^note-12b|usury]] and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy [[#^note-13a|dishonest]] gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. ^verse-13

**14**  Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will [[#^note-15a|scatter]] thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy [[#^note-15b|filthiness]] out of thee. ^verse-15

**16**  And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-17

**18**  Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become [[#^note-18a|dross]]: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the [[#^note-18b|furnace]]; they are even the dross of silver. ^verse-18

**19**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. ^verse-19

**20**  As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you. ^verse-20

**21**  Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the [[#^note-21a|fire]] of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. ^verse-21

**22**  As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-23

**24**  Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor [[#^note-24a|rained]] upon in the day of [[#^note-24b|indignation]]. ^verse-24

**25**  There is a [[#^note-25a|conspiracy]] of her [[#^note-25b|prophets]] in the midst thereof, like a [[#^note-25c|roaring lion]] ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the [[#^note-25d|treasure]] and [[#^note-25e|precious]] things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. ^verse-25

**26**  Her [[#^note-26a|priests]] have [[#^note-26b|violated]] my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no [[#^note-26c|difference]] between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my [[#^note-26d|sabbaths]], and I am [[#^note-26e|profaned]] among them. ^verse-26

**27**  Her [[#^note-27a|princes]] in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest [[#^note-27b|gain]]. ^verse-27

**28**  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [[#^note-28a|mortar]], seeing vanity, and [[#^note-28b|divining]] lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken. ^verse-28

**29**  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the [[#^note-29a|poor]] and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. ^verse-29

**30**  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not [[#^note-30a|destroy]] it: but I found none. ^verse-30

**31**  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I [[#^note-31a|recompensed]] upon their heads, saith the Lord God. ^verse-31
