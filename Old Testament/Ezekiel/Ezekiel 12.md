*Ezekiel makes himself a symbol of the scattering of the people of Judah from Jerusalem—He then prophesies their scattering among all nations.*

**1**  The word of the Lord also came unto me, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a [[#^note-2a|rebellious]] house, which have [[#^note-2b|eyes]] to see, and [[#^note-2c|see not]]; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee [[#^note-3a|stuff]] for [[#^note-3b|removing]], and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house. ^verse-3

**4**  Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity. ^verse-4

**5**  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. ^verse-5

**6**  In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the [[#^note-6a|ground]]: for I have set thee for a [[#^note-6b|sign]] unto the house of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the [[#^note-7a|even]] I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the [[#^note-9a|rebellious]] house, said unto thee, [[#^note-9b|What]] doest thou? ^verse-9

**10**  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them. ^verse-10

**11**  Say, I am your [[#^note-11a|sign]]: like as I have [[#^note-11b|done]], so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity. ^verse-11

**12**  And the prince that is among them shall [[#^note-12a|bear]] upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes. ^verse-12

**13**  My [[#^note-13a|net]] also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to [[#^note-13b|Babylon]] to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not [[#^note-13c|see]] it, though he shall die there. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will [[#^note-14a|scatter]] toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his [[#^note-14b|bands]]; and I will draw out the [[#^note-14c|sword]] after them. ^verse-14

**15**  And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall [[#^note-15a|scatter]] them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries. ^verse-15

**16**  But I will leave a [[#^note-16a|few]] men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ^verse-17

**18**  Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with [[#^note-18a|carefulness]]; ^verse-18

**19**  And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with [[#^note-19a|astonishment]], that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the [[#^note-19b|violence]] of all them that dwell therein. ^verse-19

**20**  And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-21

**22**  Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? ^verse-22

**23**  Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord God; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the [[#^note-23a|effect]] of every vision. ^verse-23

**24**  For there shall be no more any vain vision nor [[#^note-24a|flattering]] [[#^note-24b|divination]] within the house of Israel. ^verse-24

**25**  For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the [[#^note-25a|word]] that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the [[#^note-25b|word]], and will perform it, saith the Lord God. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ^verse-26

**27**  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are [[#^note-27a|far]] off. ^verse-27

**28**  Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God. ^verse-28
