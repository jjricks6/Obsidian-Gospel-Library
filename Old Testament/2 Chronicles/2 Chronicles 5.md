*The temple is finished, and the ark of the covenant is placed in the holy of holies—The glory of the Lord fills the temple.*

**1**  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ Then Solomon assembled the [[#^note-2a|elders]] of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the [[#^note-2b|ark]] of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month. ^verse-3

**4**  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark. ^verse-4

**5**  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the [[#^note-5a|priests]] and the Levites bring up. ^verse-5

**6**  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. ^verse-6

**7**  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, to the [[#^note-7a|oracle]] of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims: ^verse-7

**8**  For the [[#^note-8a|cherubims]] spread forth their [[#^note-8b|wings]] over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. ^verse-8

**9**  And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day. ^verse-9

**10**  There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course: ^verse-11

**12**  Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white [[#^note-12a|linen]], having cymbals and [[#^note-12b|psalteries]] and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) ^verse-12

**13**  It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and [[#^note-13a|thanking]] the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; ^verse-13

**14**  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the [[#^note-14a|cloud]]: for the [[#^note-14b|glory]] of the Lord had filled the house of God. ^verse-14
