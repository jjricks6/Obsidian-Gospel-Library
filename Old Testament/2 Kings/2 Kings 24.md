*Jerusalem is besieged and taken by Nebuchadnezzar—Many of the people of Judah are carried captive into Babylon—Zedekiah becomes king in Jerusalem—He rebels against Babylon.*

**1**  In his days [[#^note-1a|Nebuchadnezzar]] king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Lord sent [[#^note-2a|against]] him bands of the [[#^note-2b|Chaldees]], and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to [[#^note-2c|destroy]] it, according to the [[#^note-2d|word]] of the Lord, which he spake by his servants the prophets. ^verse-2

**3**  Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the [[#^note-3a|sins]] of [[#^note-3b|Manasseh]], according to all that he did; ^verse-3

**4**  And also for the innocent blood that he [[#^note-4a|shed]]: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the Lord would not pardon. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of [[#^note-5a|Jehoiakim]], and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? ^verse-5

**6**  So [[#^note-6a|Jehoiakim]] slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. ^verse-6

**7**  And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Jehoiachin was [[#^note-8a|eighteen]] years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. ^verse-8

**9**  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father had done. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was [[#^note-10a|besieged]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And [[#^note-11a|Nebuchadnezzar]] king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. ^verse-11

**12**  And [[#^note-12a|Jehoiachin]] the king of Judah went out to the king of [[#^note-12b|Babylon]], he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. ^verse-12

**13**  And he [[#^note-13a|carried]] out thence all the [[#^note-13b|treasures]] of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the [[#^note-13c|vessels]] of gold which [[#^note-13d|Solomon]] king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, as the Lord had said. ^verse-13

**14**  And he [[#^note-14a|carried away]] all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and [[#^note-14b|smiths]]: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. ^verse-14

**15**  And he carried away [[#^note-15a|Jehoiachin]] to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the [[#^note-15b|mighty]] of the land, those carried he into [[#^note-15c|captivity]] from Jerusalem to [[#^note-15d|Babylon]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And the king of Babylon made [[#^note-17a|Mattaniah]] his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to [[#^note-17b|Zedekiah]]. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Zedekiah]] was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. ^verse-18

**19**  And he did that which was [[#^note-19a|evil]] in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. ^verse-19

**20**  For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that [[#^note-20a|Zedekiah]] [[#^note-20b|rebelled]] against the king of Babylon. ^verse-20
