*Job asks, Is there an appointed time for man on earth? What is man that Thou shouldst magnify him? Why dost Thou not pardon my transgression?*

**1**  Is there not an [[#^note-1a|appointed]] time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an [[#^note-1b|hireling]]? ^verse-1

**2**  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: ^verse-2

**3**  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. ^verse-3

**4**  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. ^verse-4

**5**  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. ^verse-5

**6**  My [[#^note-6a|days]] are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. ^verse-6

**7**  O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. ^verse-7

**8**  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. ^verse-8

**9**  As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. ^verse-9

**10**  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore I will not [[#^note-11a|refrain]] my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will [[#^note-11b|complain]] in the bitterness of my soul. ^verse-11

**12**  Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? ^verse-12

**13**  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; ^verse-13

**14**  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: ^verse-14

**15**  So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. ^verse-15

**16**  I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. ^verse-16

**17**  What is [[#^note-17a|man]], that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? ^verse-17

**18**  And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and [[#^note-18a|try]] him every moment? ^verse-18

**19**  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? ^verse-19

**20**  I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? ^verse-20

**21**  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. ^verse-21
