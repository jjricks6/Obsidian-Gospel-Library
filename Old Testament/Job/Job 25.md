*Bildad bemoans the lowly state of man and classifies him as a worm.*

**1**  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. ^verse-2

**3**  Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? ^verse-3

**4**  How then can man be [[#^note-4a|justified]] with God? or how can he be [[#^note-4b|clean]] that is born of a woman? ^verse-4

**5**  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. ^verse-5

**6**  How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? ^verse-6
