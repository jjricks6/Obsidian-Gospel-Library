*Elihu contrasts the weakness of man and the power of God—Our wickedness hurts other men, and our righteousness helps them—Man should trust in the Lord.*

**1**  Elihu spake moreover, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? ^verse-2

**3**  For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? ^verse-3

**4**  I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. ^verse-4

**5**  Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. ^verse-5

**6**  If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? ^verse-6

**7**  If thou be [[#^note-7a|righteous]], what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? ^verse-7

**8**  Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. ^verse-8

**9**  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. ^verse-9

**10**  But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth [[#^note-10a|songs]] in the night; ^verse-10

**11**  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? ^verse-11

**12**  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. ^verse-12

**13**  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. ^verse-13

**14**  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. ^verse-14

**15**  But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. ^verse-16
