*Job seeks the Lord and asserts his own righteousnessâ€”He says, When the Lord has tried me, I will come forth as gold.*

**1**  Then Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Even to day is my [[#^note-2a|complaint]] bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. ^verse-2

**3**  Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! ^verse-3

**4**  I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. ^verse-4

**5**  I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. ^verse-5

**6**  Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put [[#^note-6a|strength]] in me. ^verse-6

**7**  There the righteous might [[#^note-7a|dispute]] with him; so should I be [[#^note-7b|delivered]] for ever from my judge. ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: ^verse-8

**9**  On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: ^verse-9

**10**  But he [[#^note-10a|knoweth]] the way that I take: when he hath [[#^note-10b|tried]] me, I shall come forth as gold. ^verse-10

**11**  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. ^verse-11

**12**  Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. ^verse-12

**13**  But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. ^verse-13

**14**  For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore am I [[#^note-15a|troubled]] at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. ^verse-15

**16**  For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: ^verse-16

**17**  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. ^verse-17
