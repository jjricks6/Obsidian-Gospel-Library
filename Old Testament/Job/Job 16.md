*Job speaks against the wicked who oppose himâ€”Though even his friends scorn him, he testifies that his witness is in heaven and his record is on high.*

**1**  Then Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  I have heard many such things: miserable [[#^note-2a|comforters]] are ye all. ^verse-2

**3**  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? ^verse-3

**4**  I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. ^verse-4

**5**  But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief. ^verse-5

**6**  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? ^verse-6

**7**  But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. ^verse-7

**8**  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. ^verse-8

**9**  He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. ^verse-9

**10**  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek [[#^note-10a|reproachfully]]; they have gathered themselves together against me. ^verse-10

**11**  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. ^verse-11

**12**  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. ^verse-12

**13**  His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. ^verse-13

**14**  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a [[#^note-14a|giant]]. ^verse-14

**15**  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and [[#^note-15a|defiled my horn]] in the dust. ^verse-15

**16**  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; ^verse-16

**17**  Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. ^verse-17

**18**  O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. ^verse-18

**19**  Also now, behold, my witness is in [[#^note-19a|heaven]], and my record is on high. ^verse-19

**20**  My friends [[#^note-20a|scorn]] me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. ^verse-20

**21**  O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! ^verse-21

**22**  When a few years are come, then I shall go the [[#^note-22a|way]] whence I shall not return. ^verse-22
