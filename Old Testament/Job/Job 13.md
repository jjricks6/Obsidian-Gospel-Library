*Job testifies of his confidence in the Lord and says, Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him, and He also will be my salvation.*

**1**  Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. ^verse-1

**2**  What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. ^verse-2

**3**  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. ^verse-3

**4**  But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all [[#^note-4a|physicians]] of no value. ^verse-4

**5**  O that ye would altogether [[#^note-5a|hold]] your peace! and it should be your wisdom. ^verse-5

**6**  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. ^verse-6

**7**  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? ^verse-7

**8**  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? ^verse-8

**9**  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? ^verse-9

**10**  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. ^verse-10

**11**  Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? ^verse-11

**12**  Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. ^verse-12

**13**  Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? ^verse-14

**15**  Though he [[#^note-15a|slay]] me, yet will I [[#^note-15b|trust]] in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. ^verse-15

**16**  He also shall be my salvation: for an [[#^note-16a|hypocrite]] shall not come before him. ^verse-16

**17**  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be [[#^note-18a|justified]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Who is he that will [[#^note-19a|plead]] with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. ^verse-19

**20**  Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. ^verse-20

**21**  Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. ^verse-21

**22**  Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. ^verse-22

**23**  How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to [[#^note-23a|know]] my transgression and my sin. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? ^verse-24

**25**  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? ^verse-25

**26**  For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the [[#^note-26a|iniquities]] of my youth. ^verse-26

**27**  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. ^verse-27

**28**  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten. ^verse-28
