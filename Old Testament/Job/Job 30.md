*Job is derided by the children of vile and base men—In his afflicted state, he cries to the Lord—Job says that he wept for those in trouble.*

**1**  But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? ^verse-2

**3**  For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. ^verse-3

**4**  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. ^verse-4

**5**  They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) ^verse-5

**6**  To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. ^verse-6

**7**  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. ^verse-7

**8**  They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. ^verse-8

**9**  And now am I their [[#^note-9a|song]], yea, I am their byword. ^verse-9

**10**  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. ^verse-10

**11**  Because [[#^note-11a|he]] hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. ^verse-11

**12**  Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. ^verse-12

**13**  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. ^verse-13

**14**  They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. ^verse-14

**15**  Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. ^verse-15

**16**  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. ^verse-16

**17**  My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. ^verse-17

**18**  By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. ^verse-18

**19**  He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. ^verse-19

**20**  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not [[#^note-20a|hear]] me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou art become [[#^note-21a|cruel]] to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. ^verse-21

**22**  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. ^verse-22

**23**  For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. ^verse-23

**24**  Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. ^verse-24

**25**  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? ^verse-25

**26**  When I looked for [[#^note-26a|good]], then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. ^verse-26

**27**  My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. ^verse-27

**28**  I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. ^verse-28

**29**  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to [[#^note-29a|owls]]. ^verse-29

**30**  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. ^verse-30

**31**  My harp also is turned to mourning, and my [[#^note-31a|organ]] into the voice of them that weep. ^verse-31
