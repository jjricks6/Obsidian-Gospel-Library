*Job tells of the ills that have befallen him and then testifies, I know that my Redeemer livesâ€”Job prophesies that he will be resurrected and that in his flesh he will see God.*

**1**  Then Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? ^verse-2

**3**  These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. ^verse-3

**4**  And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. ^verse-4

**5**  If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: ^verse-5

**6**  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no [[#^note-7a|judgment]]. ^verse-7

**8**  He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. ^verse-8

**9**  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. ^verse-9

**10**  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. ^verse-10

**11**  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. ^verse-11

**12**  His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my [[#^note-12a|tabernacle]]. ^verse-12

**13**  He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. ^verse-13

**14**  My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have [[#^note-14a|forgotten]] me. ^verse-14

**15**  They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. ^verse-15

**16**  I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth. ^verse-16

**17**  My [[#^note-17a|breath]] is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's sake of mine own body. ^verse-17

**18**  Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. ^verse-18

**19**  All my [[#^note-19a|inward]] friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. ^verse-19

**20**  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. ^verse-20

**21**  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my [[#^note-21a|friends]]; for the [[#^note-21b|hand]] of God hath touched me. ^verse-21

**22**  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with [[#^note-22a|my flesh]]? ^verse-22

**23**  Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! ^verse-23

**24**  That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! ^verse-24

**25**  For I [[#^note-25a|know]] that my [[#^note-25b|redeemer]] liveth, and that [[#^note-25c|he]] shall [[#^note-25d|stand]] at the latter day upon the earth: ^verse-25

**26**  And though after my skin worms destroy this [[#^note-26a|body]], yet in my [[#^note-26b|flesh]] shall I [[#^note-26c|see]] God: ^verse-26

**27**  Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. ^verse-27

**28**  But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? ^verse-28

**29**  Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. ^verse-29
