*Zophar asks, Canst thou by searching find out God?â€”Zophar says that the hope of the wicked will fade away as though it had died.*

**1**  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? ^verse-2

**3**  Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast said, My doctrine is [[#^note-4a|pure]], and I am clean in thine eyes. ^verse-4

**5**  But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; ^verse-5

**6**  And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God [[#^note-6a|exacteth]] of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. ^verse-6

**7**  Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? ^verse-7

**8**  It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? ^verse-8

**9**  The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ^verse-9

**10**  If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? ^verse-10

**11**  For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? ^verse-11

**12**  For [[#^note-12a|vain]] man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. ^verse-12

**13**  If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; ^verse-13

**14**  If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not [[#^note-14a|wickedness]] dwell in thy [[#^note-14b|tabernacles]]. ^verse-14

**15**  For then shalt thou lift up thy [[#^note-15a|face]] without spot; yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear: ^verse-15

**16**  Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: ^verse-16

**17**  And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. ^verse-17

**18**  And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. ^verse-18

**19**  Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. ^verse-19

**20**  But the eyes of the [[#^note-20a|wicked]] shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. ^verse-20
