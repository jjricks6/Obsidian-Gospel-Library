*Elihu says, Those who are righteous are prospered—The wicked perish and die without knowledge—Elihu praises the greatness of God.*

**1**  Elihu also proceeded, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. ^verse-2

**3**  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. ^verse-3

**4**  For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, God is mighty, and [[#^note-5a|despiseth]] not any: he is mighty in strength and [[#^note-5b|wisdom]]. ^verse-5

**6**  He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. ^verse-6

**7**  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. ^verse-7

**8**  And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; ^verse-8

**9**  Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. ^verse-9

**10**  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. ^verse-10

**11**  If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their [[#^note-11a|days]] in prosperity, and their years in [[#^note-11b|pleasures]]. ^verse-11

**12**  But if they [[#^note-12a|obey not]], they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. ^verse-12

**13**  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. ^verse-13

**14**  They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. ^verse-14

**15**  He [[#^note-15a|delivereth]] the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. ^verse-15

**16**  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. ^verse-16

**17**  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. ^verse-17

**18**  Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. ^verse-18

**19**  Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. ^verse-19

**20**  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. ^verse-20

**21**  Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? ^verse-22

**23**  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? ^verse-23

**24**  Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. ^verse-24

**25**  Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. ^verse-25

**26**  Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. ^verse-26

**27**  For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: ^verse-27

**28**  Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. ^verse-28

**29**  Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? ^verse-29

**30**  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. ^verse-30

**31**  For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. ^verse-31

**32**  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. ^verse-32

**33**  The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. ^verse-33
