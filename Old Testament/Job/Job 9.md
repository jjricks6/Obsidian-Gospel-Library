*Job acknowledges the justice and greatness of God and concludes that man cannot contend against Him.*

**1**  Then Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just [[#^note-2a|with]] God? ^verse-2

**3**  If he will [[#^note-3a|contend]] with him, he cannot answer him [[#^note-3b|one of]] a thousand. ^verse-3

**4**  He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath [[#^note-4a|hardened]] himself against him, and hath prospered? ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Which]] removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. ^verse-5

**6**  Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. ^verse-6

**7**  Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and [[#^note-7a|sealeth up]] the stars. ^verse-7

**8**  Which alone [[#^note-8a|spreadeth]] out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. ^verse-8

**9**  Which maketh Arcturus, [[#^note-9a|Orion]], and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. ^verse-9

**10**  Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. ^verse-10

**11**  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What [[#^note-12a|doest]] thou? ^verse-12

**13**  If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. ^verse-13

**14**  How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? ^verse-14

**15**  Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication [[#^note-15a|to my judge]]. ^verse-15

**16**  If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. ^verse-16

**17**  For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. ^verse-17

**18**  He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. ^verse-18

**19**  If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? ^verse-19

**20**  If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. ^verse-20

**21**  Though I were perfect, [[#^note-21a|yet]] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. ^verse-21

**22**  This is one thing, therefore I said it, He [[#^note-22a|destroyeth]] the perfect and the wicked. ^verse-22

**23**  If the scourge slay suddenly, he will [[#^note-23a|laugh]] at the trial of the innocent. ^verse-23

**24**  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? ^verse-24

**25**  Now my days are swifter than a [[#^note-25a|post]]: they flee away, they see no good. ^verse-25

**26**  They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. ^verse-26

**27**  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: ^verse-27

**28**  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. ^verse-28

**29**  If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? ^verse-29

**30**  If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; ^verse-30

**31**  Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. ^verse-31

**32**  For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. ^verse-32

**33**  Neither is there any [[#^note-33a|daysman betwixt]] us, that might lay his hand upon us both. ^verse-33

**34**  Let him take his rod away from me, and let not [[#^note-34a|his fear]] terrify me: ^verse-34

**35**  Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. ^verse-35
