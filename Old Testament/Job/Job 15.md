*Eliphaz sets forth the disquietude of wicked menâ€”They do not believe they will return out of darkness and be resurrected.*

**1**  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? ^verse-2

**3**  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. ^verse-4

**5**  For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. ^verse-5

**6**  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. ^verse-6

**7**  Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? ^verse-7

**8**  Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? ^verse-8

**9**  What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? ^verse-9

**10**  With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. ^verse-10

**11**  Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? ^verse-11

**12**  Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, ^verse-12

**13**  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? ^verse-13

**14**  What is man, that he should be [[#^note-14a|clean]]? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, [[#^note-15a|he]] putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. ^verse-15

**16**  How much more abominable and [[#^note-16a|filthy]] is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? ^verse-16

**17**  I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; ^verse-17

**18**  Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: ^verse-18

**19**  Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. ^verse-19

**20**  The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. ^verse-20

**21**  A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. ^verse-21

**22**  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. ^verse-22

**23**  He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. ^verse-23

**24**  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. ^verse-24

**25**  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. ^verse-25

**26**  He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: ^verse-26

**27**  Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and [[#^note-27a|maketh]] collops of fat on his flanks. ^verse-27

**28**  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become [[#^note-28a|heaps]]. ^verse-28

**29**  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. ^verse-29

**30**  He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. ^verse-30

**31**  Let not him that is deceived trust in [[#^note-31a|vanity]]: for vanity shall be his recompence. ^verse-31

**32**  It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. ^verse-32

**33**  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. ^verse-33

**34**  For the congregation of [[#^note-34a|hypocrites]] shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of [[#^note-34b|bribery]]. ^verse-34

**35**  They conceive [[#^note-35a|mischief]], and bring forth [[#^note-35b|vanity]], and their belly prepareth deceit. ^verse-35
