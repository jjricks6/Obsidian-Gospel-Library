*Man's weakness and ignorance are compared with God's mighty worksâ€”Does man even know how the laws of nature operate?*

**1**  Knowest thou the time when the wild [[#^note-1a|goats]] of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? ^verse-1

**2**  Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? ^verse-2

**3**  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. ^verse-3

**4**  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? ^verse-5

**6**  Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. ^verse-6

**7**  He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. ^verse-7

**8**  The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. ^verse-8

**9**  Will the [[#^note-9a|unicorn]] be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? ^verse-9

**10**  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? ^verse-10

**11**  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? ^verse-11

**12**  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? ^verse-12

**13**  Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? ^verse-13

**14**  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, ^verse-14

**15**  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. ^verse-15

**16**  She is [[#^note-16a|hardened]] against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; ^verse-16

**17**  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. ^verse-17

**18**  What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. ^verse-18

**19**  Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? ^verse-19

**20**  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. ^verse-20

**21**  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. ^verse-21

**22**  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. ^verse-22

**23**  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. ^verse-23

**24**  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. ^verse-24

**25**  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. ^verse-25

**26**  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? ^verse-26

**27**  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? ^verse-27

**28**  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. ^verse-28

**29**  From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. ^verse-29

**30**  Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. ^verse-30
