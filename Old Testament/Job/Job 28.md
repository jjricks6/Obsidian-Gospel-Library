*Wealth comes out of the earth—Wisdom cannot be purchased—The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.*

**1**  Surely there is a [[#^note-1a|vein]] for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. ^verse-1

**2**  Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. ^verse-2

**3**  He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. ^verse-3

**4**  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. ^verse-4

**5**  As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. ^verse-5

**6**  The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. ^verse-6

**7**  There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: ^verse-7

**8**  The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. ^verse-8

**9**  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. ^verse-9

**10**  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|He]] bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. ^verse-11

**12**  But where shall [[#^note-12a|wisdom]] be found? and where is the place of understanding? ^verse-12

**13**  Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. ^verse-13

**14**  The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. ^verse-14

**15**  It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. ^verse-15

**16**  It cannot be valued with the [[#^note-16a|gold]] of [[#^note-16b|Ophir]], with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. ^verse-16

**17**  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. ^verse-17

**18**  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above [[#^note-18a|rubies]]. ^verse-18

**19**  The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. ^verse-19

**20**  Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? ^verse-20

**21**  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. ^verse-21

**22**  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. ^verse-22

**23**  God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. ^verse-23

**24**  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; ^verse-24

**25**  To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. ^verse-25

**26**  When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: ^verse-26

**27**  Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. ^verse-27

**28**  And unto man he said, Behold, the [[#^note-28a|fear]] of the Lord, that is [[#^note-28b|wisdom]]; and to depart from evil is [[#^note-28c|understanding]]. ^verse-28
