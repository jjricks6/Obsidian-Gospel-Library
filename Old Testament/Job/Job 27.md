*Job asserts his righteousnessâ€”When the wicked are buried in death, terrors will take hold of them.*

**1**  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; ^verse-2

**3**  All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; ^verse-3

**4**  My lips shall not speak [[#^note-4a|wickedness]], nor my tongue utter [[#^note-4b|deceit]]. ^verse-4

**5**  God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not [[#^note-5a|remove]] mine [[#^note-5b|integrity]] from me. ^verse-5

**6**  My [[#^note-6a|righteousness]] I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not [[#^note-6b|reproach]] me so long as I live. ^verse-6

**7**  Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. ^verse-7

**8**  For what is the [[#^note-8a|hope]] of the hypocrite, though he hath [[#^note-8b|gained]], when God taketh away his soul? ^verse-8

**9**  Will God [[#^note-9a|hear]] his [[#^note-9b|cry]] when trouble cometh upon him? ^verse-9

**10**  Will he delight himself in the [[#^note-10a|Almighty]]? will he always call upon God? ^verse-10

**11**  I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? ^verse-12

**13**  This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of [[#^note-13a|oppressors]], which they shall receive of the Almighty. ^verse-13

**14**  If his [[#^note-14a|children]] be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. ^verse-14

**15**  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. ^verse-15

**16**  Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare [[#^note-16a|raiment]] as the clay; ^verse-16

**17**  He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. ^verse-17

**18**  He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. ^verse-18

**19**  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. ^verse-19

**20**  Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. ^verse-20

**21**  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. ^verse-21

**22**  For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. ^verse-22

**23**  Men shall [[#^note-23a|clap]] their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. ^verse-23
