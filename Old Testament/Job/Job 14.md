*Job testifies of the shortness of life, the certainty of death, and the guarantee of a resurrection—He asks, If a man die, will he live again?—Job answers that he will await the Lord's call to come forth from the grave.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Man]] that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. ^verse-1

**2**  He cometh forth like a flower, and is [[#^note-2a|cut]] down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. ^verse-2

**3**  And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? ^verse-3

**4**  Who can bring a clean thing out of an [[#^note-4a|unclean]]? not one. ^verse-4

**5**  Seeing his [[#^note-5a|days]] are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his [[#^note-5b|bounds]] that he cannot pass; ^verse-5

**6**  Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an [[#^note-6a|hireling]], his day. ^verse-6

**7**  For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. ^verse-7

**8**  Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; ^verse-8

**9**  Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. ^verse-9

**10**  But man [[#^note-10a|dieth]], and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? ^verse-10

**11**  As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: ^verse-11

**12**  So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. ^verse-12

**13**  O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! ^verse-13

**14**  If a man die, shall he [[#^note-14a|live]] again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. ^verse-15

**16**  For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? ^verse-16

**17**  My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. ^verse-17

**18**  And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. ^verse-18

**19**  The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. ^verse-20

**21**  His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. ^verse-21

**22**  But his flesh upon him shall have [[#^note-22a|pain]], and his soul within him shall mourn. ^verse-22
