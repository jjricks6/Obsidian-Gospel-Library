*Job speaks of the sorrow of death and of the grave in that day when the body returns to the dust.*

**1**  My [[#^note-1a|breath is corrupt]], my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. ^verse-1

**2**  Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Lay down now]], put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. ^verse-4

**5**  He that speaketh [[#^note-5a|flattery]] to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. ^verse-5

**6**  He hath made me also a byword of the people; and [[#^note-6a|aforetime]] I was as a tabret. ^verse-6

**7**  Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. ^verse-7

**8**  Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. ^verse-8

**9**  The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath [[#^note-9a|clean hands]] shall be stronger and stronger. ^verse-9

**10**  But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. ^verse-10

**11**  My [[#^note-11a|days]] are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. ^verse-11

**12**  They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. ^verse-12

**13**  If I wait, the grave is mine [[#^note-13a|house]]: I have made my bed in the darkness. ^verse-13

**14**  I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. ^verse-14

**15**  And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? ^verse-15

**16**  They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. ^verse-16
