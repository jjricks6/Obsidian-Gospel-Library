*The Lord challenges Job, and Job replies humbly—The Lord speaks of His power to Job—He asks, Hast thou an arm like God?—He points to His power in the behemoth.*

**1**  Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Then Job answered the Lord, and said, ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. ^verse-4

**5**  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^verse-6

**7**  Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. ^verse-7

**8**  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? ^verse-8

**9**  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? ^verse-9

**10**  Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. ^verse-10

**11**  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is [[#^note-11a|proud]], and abase him. ^verse-11

**12**  Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. ^verse-12

**13**  Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. ^verse-13

**14**  Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. ^verse-15

**16**  Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. ^verse-16

**17**  He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. ^verse-17

**18**  His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. ^verse-18

**19**  He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. ^verse-19

**20**  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. ^verse-20

**21**  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and [[#^note-21a|fens]]. ^verse-21

**22**  The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. ^verse-23

**24**  He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. ^verse-24
