*Zophar shows the condition of the wickedâ€”He says, The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment.*

**1**  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. ^verse-2

**3**  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. ^verse-3

**4**  Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, ^verse-4

**5**  That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the [[#^note-5a|joy]] of the hypocrite but for a moment? ^verse-5

**6**  Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; ^verse-6

**7**  Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? ^verse-7

**8**  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. ^verse-8

**9**  The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. ^verse-9

**10**  His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. ^verse-10

**11**  His bones are full of the [[#^note-11a|sin]] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. ^verse-11

**12**  Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; ^verse-12

**13**  Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: ^verse-13

**14**  Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. ^verse-14

**15**  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. ^verse-15

**16**  He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. ^verse-16

**17**  He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. ^verse-17

**18**  That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. ^verse-18

**19**  Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; ^verse-19

**20**  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. ^verse-20

**21**  There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. ^verse-21

**22**  In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. ^verse-22

**23**  When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. ^verse-23

**24**  He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. ^verse-24

**25**  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. ^verse-25

**26**  All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. ^verse-26

**27**  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. ^verse-27

**28**  The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. ^verse-28

**29**  This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. ^verse-29
