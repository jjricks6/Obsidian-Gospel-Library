*God asks Job where he was when the foundations of the earth were laid, when the morning stars sang together, and when all the sons of God shouted for joyâ€”The phenomena of nature show the greatness of God and the weakness of man.*

**1**  Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? ^verse-2

**3**  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. ^verse-3

**4**  Where wast thou when I [[#^note-4a|laid]] the [[#^note-4b|foundations]] of the [[#^note-4c|earth]]? declare, if thou hast understanding. ^verse-4

**5**  Who hath [[#^note-5a|laid the measures thereof]], if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? ^verse-5

**6**  Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the [[#^note-6a|corner stone]] thereof; ^verse-6

**7**  When the morning stars [[#^note-7a|sang]] together, and all the [[#^note-7b|sons]] of God shouted for [[#^note-7c|joy]]? ^verse-7

**8**  Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? ^verse-8

**9**  When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, ^verse-9

**10**  And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, ^verse-10

**11**  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? ^verse-11

**12**  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; ^verse-12

**13**  That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? ^verse-13

**14**  It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. ^verse-14

**15**  And from the wicked their light is [[#^note-15a|withholden]], and the high [[#^note-15b|arm]] shall be broken. ^verse-15

**16**  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? ^verse-16

**17**  Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? ^verse-17

**18**  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. ^verse-18

**19**  Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, ^verse-19

**20**  That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? ^verse-20

**21**  Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? ^verse-21

**22**  Hast thou entered into the [[#^note-22a|treasures]] of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, ^verse-22

**23**  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? ^verse-23

**24**  By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? ^verse-24

**25**  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; ^verse-25

**26**  To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; ^verse-26

**27**  To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? ^verse-27

**28**  Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? ^verse-28

**29**  Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? ^verse-29

**30**  The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. ^verse-30

**31**  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of [[#^note-31a|Orion]]? ^verse-31

**32**  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? ^verse-32

**33**  Knowest thou the [[#^note-33a|ordinances]] of [[#^note-33b|heaven]]? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? ^verse-33

**34**  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? ^verse-34

**35**  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? ^verse-35

**36**  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? ^verse-36

**37**  Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the [[#^note-37a|bottles]] of heaven, ^verse-37

**38**  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? ^verse-38

**39**  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, ^verse-39

**40**  When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? ^verse-40

**41**  Who provideth for the [[#^note-41a|raven]] his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. ^verse-41
