*Job recalls his former prosperity and greatnessâ€”He was blessed because of his righteousness, his charity, and his good deeds.*

**1**  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; ^verse-2

**3**  When his [[#^note-3a|candle]] shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; ^verse-3

**4**  As I was in the days of my youth, when the [[#^note-4a|secret]] of God was upon my tabernacle; ^verse-4

**5**  When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; ^verse-5

**6**  When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; ^verse-6

**7**  When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! ^verse-7

**8**  The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. ^verse-8

**9**  The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. ^verse-9

**10**  The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. ^verse-10

**11**  When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: ^verse-11

**12**  Because I delivered the [[#^note-12a|poor]] that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. ^verse-12

**13**  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. ^verse-13

**14**  I put on [[#^note-14a|righteousness]], and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. ^verse-14

**15**  I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. ^verse-15

**16**  I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. ^verse-16

**17**  And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. ^verse-17

**18**  Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. ^verse-18

**19**  My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. ^verse-19

**20**  My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. ^verse-20

**21**  Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. ^verse-21

**22**  After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. ^verse-22

**23**  And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. ^verse-23

**24**  If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. ^verse-24

**25**  I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. ^verse-25
