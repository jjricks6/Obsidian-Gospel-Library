*Bildad asks, Doth God pervert judgment?â€”Bildad says, Our days upon earth are a shadow, and God will not cast away a perfect man.*

**1**  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? ^verse-2

**3**  Doth God pervert [[#^note-3a|judgment]]? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? ^verse-3

**4**  If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; ^verse-4

**5**  If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; ^verse-5

**6**  If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. ^verse-6

**7**  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. ^verse-7

**8**  For inquire, I pray thee, of the former [[#^note-8a|age]], and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: ^verse-8

**9**  (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our [[#^note-9a|days]] upon earth are a shadow:) ^verse-9

**10**  Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? ^verse-10

**11**  Can the rush grow up without mire? can the [[#^note-11a|flag]] grow without water? ^verse-11

**12**  Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. ^verse-12

**13**  So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: ^verse-13

**14**  Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. ^verse-14

**15**  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. ^verse-15

**16**  He is [[#^note-16a|green]] before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. ^verse-16

**17**  His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. ^verse-17

**18**  If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. ^verse-18

**19**  Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. ^verse-19

**20**  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: ^verse-20

**21**  Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. ^verse-21

**22**  They that hate thee shall be clothed with [[#^note-22a|shame]]; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. ^verse-22
