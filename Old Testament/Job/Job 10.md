*Job is weary of life—He reasons with God about his afflictions—He asks, Why hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb?*

**1**  My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the [[#^note-1a|bitterness]] of my soul. ^verse-1

**2**  I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. ^verse-2

**3**  Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? ^verse-3

**4**  Hast thou eyes of flesh? or [[#^note-4a|seest]] thou as man seeth? ^verse-4

**5**  Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, ^verse-5

**6**  That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? ^verse-6

**7**  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. ^verse-7

**8**  Thine hands have [[#^note-8a|made]] me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. ^verse-8

**9**  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into [[#^note-9a|dust]] again? ^verse-9

**10**  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? ^verse-10

**11**  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast [[#^note-11a|fenced]] me with bones and sinews. ^verse-11

**12**  Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy [[#^note-12a|visitation]] hath preserved my spirit. ^verse-12

**13**  And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee. ^verse-13

**14**  If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. ^verse-14

**15**  If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; ^verse-15

**16**  For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. ^verse-16

**17**  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; [[#^note-17a|changes]] and war are against me. ^verse-17

**18**  Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the [[#^note-18a|ghost]], and no eye had seen me! ^verse-18

**19**  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. ^verse-19

**20**  Are not my [[#^note-20a|days]] few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, ^verse-20

**21**  Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of [[#^note-21a|death]]; ^verse-21

**22**  A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any [[#^note-22a|order]], and where the [[#^note-22b|light]] is as darkness. ^verse-22
