*Job says, The souls of all things are in the hands of the Lord, with the ancient is wisdom, and the Lord governs in all things.*

**1**  And Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. ^verse-2

**3**  But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? ^verse-3

**4**  I am as one [[#^note-4a|mocked]] of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. ^verse-4

**5**  He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. ^verse-5

**6**  The [[#^note-6a|tabernacles]] of robbers [[#^note-6b|prosper]], and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. ^verse-6

**7**  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: ^verse-7

**8**  Or speak to the [[#^note-8a|earth]], and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? ^verse-9

**10**  In whose hand is the soul of every [[#^note-10a|living]] thing, and the [[#^note-10b|breath]] of all mankind. ^verse-10

**11**  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? ^verse-11

**12**  With the [[#^note-12a|ancient]] is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. ^verse-12

**13**  With him is [[#^note-13a|wisdom]] and [[#^note-13b|strength]], he hath counsel and understanding. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, he [[#^note-15a|withholdeth]] the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. ^verse-15

**16**  With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. ^verse-16

**17**  He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. ^verse-17

**18**  He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. ^verse-18

**19**  He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. ^verse-19

**20**  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. ^verse-20

**21**  He poureth contempt upon [[#^note-21a|princes]], and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. ^verse-21

**22**  He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. ^verse-22

**23**  He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. ^verse-23

**24**  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to [[#^note-24a|wander]] in a wilderness where there is no way. ^verse-24

**25**  They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. ^verse-25
