*Eliphaz counsels Job: Man is born unto trouble, seek unto God, and happy is the man whom God corrects.*

**1**  Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the [[#^note-1a|saints]] wilt thou turn? ^verse-1

**2**  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the [[#^note-2a|silly]] one. ^verse-2

**3**  I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. ^verse-3

**4**  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. ^verse-4

**5**  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. ^verse-5

**6**  Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; ^verse-6

**7**  Yet man is born unto [[#^note-7a|trouble]], as the sparks fly upward. ^verse-7

**8**  I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: ^verse-8

**9**  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: ^verse-9

**10**  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: ^verse-10

**11**  To set up on high those that be low; that those which [[#^note-11a|mourn]] may be exalted to safety. ^verse-11

**12**  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. ^verse-12

**13**  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. ^verse-13

**14**  They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night. ^verse-14

**15**  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. ^verse-15

**16**  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, [[#^note-17a|happy]] is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the [[#^note-17b|chastening]] of the Almighty: ^verse-17

**18**  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he [[#^note-18a|woundeth]], and his hands make whole. ^verse-18

**19**  He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. ^verse-19

**20**  In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be [[#^note-21a|afraid]] of destruction when it cometh. ^verse-21

**22**  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. ^verse-22

**23**  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the [[#^note-23a|beasts]] of the field shall be at peace with thee. ^verse-23

**24**  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. ^verse-24

**25**  Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the [[#^note-25a|grass]] of the earth. ^verse-25

**26**  Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of [[#^note-26a|corn]] cometh in in his season. ^verse-26

**27**  Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good. ^verse-27
