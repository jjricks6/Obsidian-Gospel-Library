*Elihu, in anger, answers Job and his three friends—Elihu says, There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding—He also says, Great men are not always wise.*

**1**  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. ^verse-1

**2**  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. ^verse-2

**3**  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. ^verse-3

**4**  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. ^verse-4

**5**  When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. ^verse-5

**6**  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. ^verse-6

**7**  I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. ^verse-7

**8**  But there is a [[#^note-8a|spirit]] in man: and the [[#^note-8b|inspiration]] of the Almighty giveth them [[#^note-8c|understanding]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: ^verse-12

**13**  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. ^verse-13

**14**  Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. ^verse-14

**15**  They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. ^verse-15

**16**  When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) ^verse-16

**17**  I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. ^verse-17

**18**  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. ^verse-18

**19**  Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new [[#^note-19a|bottles]]. ^verse-19

**20**  I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. ^verse-20

**21**  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. ^verse-21

**22**  For I know not to give [[#^note-22a|flattering]] titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away. ^verse-22
