*Job admits that the wicked sometimes prosper in this lifeâ€”Then he testifies that their judgment will be hereafter in the day of wrath and destruction.*

**1**  But Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. ^verse-2

**3**  Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, [[#^note-3a|mock]] on. ^verse-3

**4**  As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? ^verse-4

**5**  Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your [[#^note-5a|hand]] upon your mouth. ^verse-5

**6**  Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are [[#^note-7a|mighty]] in power? ^verse-7

**8**  Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. ^verse-8

**9**  Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. ^verse-9

**10**  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. ^verse-10

**11**  They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. ^verse-11

**12**  They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the [[#^note-12a|organ]]. ^verse-12

**13**  They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. ^verse-14

**15**  What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? ^verse-15

**16**  Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^verse-16

**17**  How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. ^verse-17

**18**  They are as stubble before the wind, and as [[#^note-18a|chaff]] that the storm carrieth away. ^verse-18

**19**  God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he [[#^note-19a|rewardeth]] him, and he shall know it. ^verse-19

**20**  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall [[#^note-20a|drink]] of the wrath of the Almighty. ^verse-20

**21**  For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? ^verse-21

**22**  Shall any [[#^note-22a|teach]] God [[#^note-22b|knowledge]]? seeing he judgeth those that are high. ^verse-22

**23**  One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. ^verse-23

**24**  His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. ^verse-24

**25**  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. ^verse-25

**26**  They shall lie down alike in the [[#^note-26a|dust]], and the worms shall cover them. ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. ^verse-27

**28**  For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? ^verse-28

**29**  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, ^verse-29

**30**  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. ^verse-30

**31**  Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall [[#^note-31a|repay]] him what he hath done? ^verse-31

**32**  Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. ^verse-32

**33**  The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. ^verse-33

**34**  How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth [[#^note-34a|falsehood]]? ^verse-34
