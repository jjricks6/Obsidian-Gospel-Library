*Bildad tells of the damned state of the wicked who know not God.*

**1**  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^verse-1

**2**  How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? ^verse-3

**4**  He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? ^verse-4

**5**  Yea, the [[#^note-5a|light]] of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. ^verse-5

**6**  The light shall be dark in his [[#^note-6a|tabernacle]], and his candle shall be put out with him. ^verse-6

**7**  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. ^verse-7

**8**  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. ^verse-8

**9**  The [[#^note-9a|gin]] shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him. ^verse-9

**10**  The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. ^verse-10

**11**  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. ^verse-11

**12**  His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. ^verse-12

**13**  It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. ^verse-13

**14**  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. ^verse-14

**15**  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. ^verse-15

**16**  His [[#^note-16a|roots]] shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. ^verse-16

**17**  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. ^verse-17

**18**  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. ^verse-18

**19**  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. ^verse-19

**20**  They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. ^verse-20

**21**  Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. ^verse-21
