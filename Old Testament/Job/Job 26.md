*Job reproves Bildad's lack of empathyâ€”He extols the power, greatness, and strength of the Lord.*

**1**  But Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? ^verse-2

**3**  How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? ^verse-3

**4**  To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? ^verse-4

**5**  Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Hell]] is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. ^verse-6

**7**  He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. ^verse-7

**8**  He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. ^verse-8

**9**  He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. ^verse-9

**10**  He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. ^verse-10

**11**  The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. ^verse-11

**12**  He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. ^verse-12

**13**  By his [[#^note-13a|spirit]] he hath [[#^note-13b|garnished]] the [[#^note-13c|heavens]]; his hand hath formed the crooked [[#^note-13d|serpent]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? ^verse-14
