*Job bemoans his grief—He prays that God will grant his petitions—Those who are afflicted should be pitied—How forcible are right words!*

**1**  But Job answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Oh that my [[#^note-2a|grief]] were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! ^verse-2

**3**  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. ^verse-3

**4**  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. ^verse-4

**5**  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? ^verse-5

**6**  Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? ^verse-6

**7**  The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. ^verse-7

**8**  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! ^verse-8

**9**  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! ^verse-9

**10**  Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. ^verse-10

**11**  What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? ^verse-11

**12**  Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? ^verse-12

**13**  Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? ^verse-13

**14**  To him that is afflicted [[#^note-14a|pity]] should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. ^verse-14

**15**  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; ^verse-15

**16**  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: ^verse-16

**17**  What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. ^verse-17

**18**  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. ^verse-18

**19**  The [[#^note-19a|troops]] of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. ^verse-19

**20**  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. ^verse-20

**21**  For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. ^verse-21

**22**  Did I say, [[#^note-22a|Bring]] unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? ^verse-22

**23**  Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? ^verse-23

**24**  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. ^verse-24

**25**  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? ^verse-25

**26**  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? ^verse-26

**27**  Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a [[#^note-27a|pit]] for your friend. ^verse-27

**28**  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. ^verse-28

**29**  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. ^verse-29

**30**  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? ^verse-30
