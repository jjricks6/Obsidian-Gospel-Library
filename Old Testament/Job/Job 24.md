*Murderers, adulterers, those who oppress the poor, and wicked people in general often go unpunished for a little while.*

**1**  Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? ^verse-1

**2**  Some remove the [[#^note-2a|landmarks]]; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. ^verse-2

**3**  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. ^verse-3

**4**  They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. ^verse-5

**6**  They reap every one his [[#^note-6a|corn]] in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. ^verse-6

**7**  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. ^verse-7

**8**  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. ^verse-8

**9**  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. ^verse-9

**10**  They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; ^verse-10

**11**  Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. ^verse-11

**12**  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God [[#^note-12a|layeth]] not folly to them. ^verse-12

**13**  They are of those that [[#^note-13a|rebel]] against the [[#^note-13b|light]]; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. ^verse-13

**14**  The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. ^verse-14

**15**  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the [[#^note-15a|twilight]], saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. ^verse-15

**16**  In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the [[#^note-16a|light]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. ^verse-17

**18**  He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Drought]] and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. ^verse-19

**20**  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. ^verse-20

**21**  He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. ^verse-21

**22**  He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. ^verse-22

**23**  Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. ^verse-23

**24**  They are exalted for a [[#^note-24a|little while]], but are gone and brought [[#^note-24b|low]]; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the [[#^note-24c|tops]] of the ears of corn. ^verse-24

**25**  And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? ^verse-25
