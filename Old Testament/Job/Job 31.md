*Job invites judgment so that God may know his integrityâ€”If he has done ill, Job welcomes the penalties for so doing.*

**1**  I made a [[#^note-1a|covenant]] with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? ^verse-1

**2**  For what portion of God is there from above? and what [[#^note-2a|inheritance]] of the Almighty from on high? ^verse-2

**3**  Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? ^verse-3

**4**  Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? ^verse-4

**5**  If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath [[#^note-5a|hasted]] to [[#^note-5b|deceit]]; ^verse-5

**6**  Let me be [[#^note-6a|weighed]] in an even balance, that God may know mine [[#^note-6b|integrity]]. ^verse-6

**7**  If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart [[#^note-7a|walked]] after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; ^verse-7

**8**  Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. ^verse-8

**9**  If mine heart have been [[#^note-9a|deceived]] by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; ^verse-9

**10**  Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. ^verse-10

**11**  For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. ^verse-11

**12**  For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. ^verse-12

**13**  If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; ^verse-13

**14**  What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? ^verse-14

**15**  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one [[#^note-15a|fashion]] us in the womb? ^verse-15

**16**  If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; ^verse-16

**17**  Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; ^verse-17

**18**  (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) ^verse-18

**19**  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; ^verse-19

**20**  If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; ^verse-20

**21**  If I have lifted up my hand against the [[#^note-21a|fatherless]], when I saw my help in the gate: ^verse-21

**22**  Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. ^verse-22

**23**  For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. ^verse-23

**24**  If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; ^verse-24

**25**  If I rejoiced because my [[#^note-25a|wealth]] was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; ^verse-25

**26**  If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; ^verse-26

**27**  And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: ^verse-27

**28**  This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. ^verse-28

**29**  If I [[#^note-29a|rejoiced]] at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: ^verse-29

**30**  Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a [[#^note-30a|curse]] to his soul. ^verse-30

**31**  If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. ^verse-31

**32**  The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. ^verse-32

**33**  If I [[#^note-33a|covered]] my transgressions [[#^note-33b|as Adam]], by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: ^verse-33

**34**  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? ^verse-34

**35**  Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. ^verse-35

**36**  Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. ^verse-36

**37**  I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. ^verse-37

**38**  If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; ^verse-38

**39**  If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: ^verse-39

**40**  Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and [[#^note-40a|cockle]] instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. ^verse-40
