*Job curses the circumstances of his birthâ€”He asks, Why died I not from the womb?*

**1**  After this opened Job his mouth, and [[#^note-1a|cursed]] his day. ^verse-1

**2**  And Job spake, and said, ^verse-2

**3**  Let the day [[#^note-3a|perish]] wherein I was [[#^note-3b|born]], and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. ^verse-3

**4**  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. ^verse-4

**5**  Let darkness and the [[#^note-5a|shadow of death]] stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. ^verse-5

**6**  As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. ^verse-6

**7**  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. ^verse-7

**8**  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. ^verse-8

**9**  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: ^verse-9

**10**  Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. ^verse-10

**11**  Why [[#^note-11a|died]] I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? ^verse-11

**12**  Why did the knees [[#^note-12a|prevent]] me? or why the breasts that I should suck? ^verse-12

**13**  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, ^verse-13

**14**  With kings and counsellors of the earth, [[#^note-14a|which built desolate places]] for themselves; ^verse-14

**15**  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: ^verse-15

**16**  Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. ^verse-16

**17**  There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at [[#^note-17a|rest]]. ^verse-17

**18**  There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. ^verse-18

**19**  The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore is [[#^note-20a|light]] given to him that is in [[#^note-20b|misery]], and life unto the bitter in soul; ^verse-20

**21**  Which long for [[#^note-21a|death]], but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; ^verse-21

**22**  Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? ^verse-22

**23**  Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? ^verse-23

**24**  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. ^verse-24

**25**  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. ^verse-25

**26**  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. ^verse-26
