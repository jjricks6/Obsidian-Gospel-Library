*Elihu concludes, saying, The Lord controls the laws of natureâ€”God reigns in terrible majesty.*

**1**  At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. ^verse-1

**2**  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. ^verse-2

**3**  He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-3

**4**  After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. ^verse-4

**5**  God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. ^verse-5

**6**  For he saith to the [[#^note-6a|snow]], Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. ^verse-6

**7**  He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. ^verse-7

**8**  Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. ^verse-8

**9**  Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. ^verse-9

**10**  By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. ^verse-10

**11**  Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: ^verse-11

**12**  And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. ^verse-13

**14**  Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and [[#^note-14a|consider]] the wondrous [[#^note-14b|works]] of God. ^verse-14

**15**  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? ^verse-15

**16**  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in [[#^note-16a|knowledge]]? ^verse-16

**17**  How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? ^verse-17

**18**  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? ^verse-18

**19**  Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. ^verse-19

**20**  Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. ^verse-20

**21**  And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. ^verse-21

**22**  Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. ^verse-22

**23**  Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of [[#^note-23a|justice]]: he will not [[#^note-23b|afflict]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. ^verse-24
