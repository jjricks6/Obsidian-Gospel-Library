*Eliphaz accuses Job of various sins and exhorts him to repent.*

**1**  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? ^verse-2

**3**  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art [[#^note-3a|righteous]]? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways [[#^note-3b|perfect]]? ^verse-3

**4**  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? ^verse-4

**5**  Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? ^verse-5

**6**  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden [[#^note-7a|bread]] from the [[#^note-7b|hungry]]. ^verse-7

**8**  But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the [[#^note-9a|fatherless]] have been broken. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; ^verse-10

**11**  Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. ^verse-11

**12**  Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! ^verse-12

**13**  And thou sayest, How doth God [[#^note-13a|know]]? can he [[#^note-13b|judge]] through the dark cloud? ^verse-13

**14**  Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. ^verse-14

**15**  Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? ^verse-15

**16**  Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: ^verse-16

**17**  Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? ^verse-17

**18**  Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^verse-18

**19**  The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. ^verse-19

**20**  Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. ^verse-20

**21**  Acquaint now thyself with [[#^note-21a|him]], and be at [[#^note-21b|peace]]: thereby good shall come unto thee. ^verse-21

**22**  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. ^verse-22

**23**  If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be [[#^note-23a|built]] up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. ^verse-23

**24**  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. ^verse-24

**25**  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. ^verse-25

**26**  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy [[#^note-26a|face]] unto God. ^verse-26

**27**  Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy [[#^note-27a|vows]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. ^verse-28

**29**  When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the [[#^note-29a|humble]] person. ^verse-29

**30**  He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. ^verse-30
