*Elihu teaches, God cannot be unjust, commit iniquity, pervert judgment, or respect personsâ€”Man should bear chastisement and do iniquity no more.*

**1**  Furthermore Elihu answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. ^verse-2

**3**  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. ^verse-3

**4**  Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. ^verse-4

**5**  For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. ^verse-5

**6**  Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. ^verse-6

**7**  What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? ^verse-7

**8**  Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. ^verse-8

**9**  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. ^verse-10

**11**  For the [[#^note-11a|work]] of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert [[#^note-12a|judgment]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? ^verse-13

**14**  If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; ^verse-14

**15**  All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto [[#^note-15a|dust]]. ^verse-15

**16**  If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. ^verse-16

**17**  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? ^verse-17

**18**  Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? ^verse-18

**19**  How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. ^verse-19

**20**  In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. ^verse-20

**21**  For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. ^verse-21

**22**  There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may [[#^note-22a|hide]] themselves. ^verse-22

**23**  For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. ^verse-23

**24**  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. ^verse-24

**25**  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. ^verse-25

**26**  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; ^verse-26

**27**  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: ^verse-27

**28**  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. ^verse-28

**29**  When he giveth [[#^note-29a|quietness]], who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: ^verse-29

**30**  That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. ^verse-30

**31**  Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [[#^note-31a|chastisement]], I will not offend any more: ^verse-31

**32**  That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. ^verse-32

**33**  Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. ^verse-33

**34**  Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. ^verse-34

**35**  Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. ^verse-35

**36**  My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. ^verse-36

**37**  For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. ^verse-37
