*Eliphaz reproves Job, asking such questions as, Are the righteous cut off? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?*

**1**  Then [[#^note-1a|Eliphaz]] the Temanite answered and said, ^verse-1

**2**  If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. ^verse-3

**4**  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. ^verse-4

**5**  But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. ^verse-5

**6**  Is not this thy fear, thy [[#^note-6a|confidence]], thy hope, and the [[#^note-6b|uprightness]] of thy ways? ^verse-6

**7**  Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being [[#^note-7a|innocent]]? or where were the righteous cut off? ^verse-7

**8**  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and [[#^note-8a|sow]] wickedness, reap the same. ^verse-8

**9**  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. ^verse-9

**10**  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the [[#^note-10a|teeth]] of the young lions, are broken. ^verse-10

**11**  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. ^verse-11

**12**  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, ^verse-13

**14**  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. ^verse-14

**15**  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: ^verse-15

**16**  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was [[#^note-16a|silence]], and I heard a [[#^note-16b|voice]], saying, ^verse-16

**17**  Shall mortal man be more [[#^note-17a|just]] than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: ^verse-18

**19**  How much less in them that dwell in houses of [[#^note-19a|clay]], whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? ^verse-19

**20**  They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. ^verse-20

**21**  Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. ^verse-21
