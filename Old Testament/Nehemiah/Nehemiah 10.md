**29**  They cl[[#^note-29a|a]]ve to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a [[#^note-29b|curse]], and into an [[#^note-29c|oath]], to walk in God's [[#^note-29d|law]], which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord [[#^note-29e|our Lord]], and his judgments and his statutes; ^verse-29

**30**  And that we would not give our [[#^note-30a|daughters]] unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons: ^verse-30

**31**  And if the people of the land bring [[#^note-31a|ware]] or any [[#^note-31b|victuals]] on the [[#^note-31c|sabbath]] day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the [[#^note-31d|seventh]] year, and the exaction of every debt. ^verse-31

**34**  And we [[#^note-34a|cast]] the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the [[#^note-34b|wood]] offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law: ^verse-34

**35**  And to bring the [[#^note-35a|firstfruits]] of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the Lord: ^verse-35

**37**  And that we should bring the firstfruits of our [[#^note-37a|dough]], and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. ^verse-37

**38**  And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take [[#^note-38a|tithe]]s: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. ^verse-38
