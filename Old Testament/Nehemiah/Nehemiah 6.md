*Sanballat engages in intrigue against Nehemiah and the building of the wall—The Jews finish the construction of the wall.*

**1**  Now it came to pass, when [[#^note-1a|Sanballat]], and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) ^verse-1

**2**  That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me [[#^note-2a|mischief]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? ^verse-3

**4**  Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. ^verse-4

**5**  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; ^verse-5

**6**  Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and [[#^note-6a|Gashmu]] saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. ^verse-6

**7**  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. ^verse-7

**8**  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou [[#^note-8a|feignest]] them out of thine own heart. ^verse-8

**9**  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. ^verse-9

**10**  Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. ^verse-10

**11**  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is [[#^note-11a|there]], that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. ^verse-11

**12**  And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore was he hired, that I should be [[#^note-13a|afraid]], and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an [[#^note-13b|evil report]], that they might reproach me. ^verse-13

**14**  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month [[#^note-15a|Elul]], in fifty and two days. ^verse-15

**16**  And it came to pass, that when all our [[#^note-16a|enemies]] heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. ^verse-17

**18**  For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of [[#^note-18a|Meshullam]] the son of Berechiah. ^verse-18

**19**  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. ^verse-19
