*Provision is made to protect Jerusalem—The genealogy is given of the Jews who returned from Babylon—Priests without genealogical records are denied the priesthood.*

**1**  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, ^verse-1

**2**  That I gave my brother [[#^note-2a|Hanani]], and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a [[#^note-2b|faithful]] man, and [[#^note-2c|feared]] God above many. ^verse-2

**3**  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. ^verse-3

**4**  Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a [[#^note-5a|register]] of the [[#^note-5b|genealogy]] of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, ^verse-5

**6**  These are the [[#^note-6a|children]] of the province, that went up out of the [[#^note-6b|captivity]], of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; ^verse-6
