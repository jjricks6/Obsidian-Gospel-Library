*Nehemiah mourns, fasts, and prays for the Jews in Jerusalem.*

**1**  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month [[#^note-1a|Chisleu]], in the twentieth year, as I was in [[#^note-1b|Shushan]] the palace, ^verse-1

**2**  That [[#^note-2a|Hanani]], one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. ^verse-2

**3**  And they said unto me, The [[#^note-3a|remnant]] that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. ^verse-3

**4**  Â¶ And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and [[#^note-4a|fasted]], and prayed before the God of heaven, ^verse-4

**5**  And said, I beseech [[#^note-5a|the]]e, O Lord God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that [[#^note-5b|keepeth]] covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: ^verse-5

**6**  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and [[#^note-6a|confess]] the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. ^verse-6

**7**  We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. ^verse-7

**8**  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will [[#^note-8a|scatter]] you abroad among the nations: ^verse-8

**9**  But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I [[#^note-9a|gather]] them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. ^verse-9

**10**  Now these are thy servants and thy [[#^note-10a|people]], whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. ^verse-10

**11**  O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to [[#^note-11a|fear]] thy name: and [[#^note-11b|prosper]], I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. ^verse-11
