*Zerubbabel will lay the foundation of and finish the house of the Lord, the temple of Zerubbabel.*

**1**  And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, ^verse-1

**2**  And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a [[#^note-2a|candlestick]] all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: ^verse-2

**3**  And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. ^verse-3

**4**  So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? ^verse-4

**5**  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my [[#^note-6a|spirit]], saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-6

**7**  Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. ^verse-7

**8**  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. ^verse-9

**10**  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth. ^verse-10

**11**  Â¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? ^verse-11

**12**  And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? ^verse-12

**13**  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. ^verse-13

**14**  Then said he, These are the two [[#^note-14a|anointed]] ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth. ^verse-14
