*Zechariah speaks about the Messiah—The Branch will come—At the Second Coming, iniquity will be removed in one day.*

**1**  And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the [[#^note-1a|angel]] of the Lord, and [[#^note-1b|Satan]] standing at his right hand to [[#^note-1c|resist]] him. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a [[#^note-2a|brand]] plucked out of the fire? ^verse-2

**3**  Now Joshua was clothed with [[#^note-3a|filthy]] garments, and stood before the angel. ^verse-3

**4**  And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. ^verse-4

**5**  And I said, Let them set [[#^note-5a|a fair mitre]] upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord stood by. ^verse-5

**6**  And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying, ^verse-6

**7**  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt [[#^note-7a|walk]] in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my [[#^note-7b|charge]], then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among [[#^note-7c|these that stand by]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the [[#^note-8a|Branch]]. ^verse-8

**9**  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. ^verse-9

**10**  In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree. ^verse-10
