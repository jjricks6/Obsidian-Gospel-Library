*Zechariah speaks as the Messiah—The Messiah will come, having salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass—He will free the prisoners from the pit—Judah and Ephraim are instruments of the Lord.*

**1**  The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. ^verse-2

**3**  And [[#^note-3a|Tyrus]] did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Ashkelon]] shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. ^verse-5

**6**  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. ^verse-6

**7**  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a [[#^note-7a|Jebusite]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. ^verse-8

**9**    ¶ Rejoice greatly, O [[#^note-9a|daughter]] of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy [[#^note-9b|King]] cometh unto thee: he is [[#^note-9c|just]], and having salvation; lowly, and [[#^note-9d|riding]] upon an [[#^note-9e|ass]], and upon a [[#^note-9f|colt]] the foal of an ass. ^verse-9

**10**  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the [[#^note-10a|horse]] from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the [[#^note-10b|heathen]]: and his [[#^note-10c|dominion]] shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  As for thee also, by the [[#^note-11a|blood]] of thy [[#^note-11b|covenant]] I have sent forth thy [[#^note-11c|prisoners]] out of the [[#^note-11d|pit]] wherein is no water. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of [[#^note-12a|hope]]: even to day do I declare that I will [[#^note-12b|render]] [[#^note-12c|double]] unto thee; ^verse-12

**13**  When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with [[#^note-14a|whirlwinds]] of the south. ^verse-14

**15**  The Lord of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar. ^verse-15

**16**  And the Lord their God shall [[#^note-16a|save]] them in that [[#^note-16b|day]] as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the [[#^note-16c|stones]] of a [[#^note-16d|crown]], lifted up as an [[#^note-16e|ensign]] upon his land. ^verse-16

**17**  For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. ^verse-17
