*The Jews will gain forgiveness at the Second Coming—They will ask the Lord, What are these wounds in Thine hands?—The remnant, tried and refined, will be His people.*

**1**  In that day there shall be a [[#^note-1a|fountain]] opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the [[#^note-2a|idols]] out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. ^verse-3

**4**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be [[#^note-4a|ashamed]] every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a [[#^note-4b|rough]] garment to deceive: ^verse-4

**5**  But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. ^verse-5

**6**  And one shall say unto him, What are these [[#^note-6a|wounds]] in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was [[#^note-6b|wounded]] in the house of my friends. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man [[#^note-7a|that is my fellow]], saith the Lord of hosts: smite the [[#^note-7b|shepherd]], and the [[#^note-7c|sheep]] shall be [[#^note-7d|scattered]]: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be [[#^note-8a|left]] therein. ^verse-8

**9**  And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will [[#^note-9a|refine]] them as silver is refined, and will [[#^note-9b|try]] them as gold is [[#^note-9c|tried]]: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my [[#^note-9d|people]]: and they shall say, The Lord is my God. ^verse-9
