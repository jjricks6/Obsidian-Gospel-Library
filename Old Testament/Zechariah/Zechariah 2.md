*In the last days, Judah will gather to Jerusalem—The people will come from the land of the north—The Lord will dwell among them.*

**1**  I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring [[#^note-1a|line]] in his hand. ^verse-1

**2**  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. ^verse-2

**3**  And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, ^verse-3

**4**  And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be [[#^note-4a|inhabited]] as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: ^verse-4

**5**  For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of [[#^note-5a|fire]] round about, and will be the [[#^note-5b|glory]] in the midst of her. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the [[#^note-6a|north]], saith the Lord: for I have [[#^note-6b|spread]] you abroad as the [[#^note-6c|four]] winds of the heaven, saith the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Deliver]] thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. ^verse-7

**8**  For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. ^verse-8

**9**  For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will [[#^note-10a|dwell]] in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  And many [[#^note-11a|nations]] shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the [[#^note-11b|midst]] of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. ^verse-11

**12**  And the Lord shall inherit [[#^note-12a|Judah]] his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. ^verse-12

**13**  Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord: for he is raised up out of his holy [[#^note-13a|habitation]]. ^verse-13
