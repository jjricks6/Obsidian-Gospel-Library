*Judah and Joseph will be scattered among the people in far countries—The Lord will hiss for them, gather them, and redeem them.*

**1**  Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the [[#^note-1a|latter]] rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. ^verse-1

**2**  For the idols have spoken vanity, and the [[#^note-2a|diviners]] have seen a lie, and have told false [[#^note-2b|dreams]]; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no [[#^note-2c|shepherd]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the Lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. ^verse-3

**4**  Out of him came forth [[#^note-4a|the corner]], out of him the [[#^note-4b|nail]], out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. ^verse-5

**6**  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and will [[#^note-6a|hear]] them. ^verse-6

**7**  And they of [[#^note-7a|Ephraim]] shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  I will hiss for them, and [[#^note-8a|gather]] them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. ^verse-8

**9**  And I will [[#^note-9a|sow]] them among the people: and they shall [[#^note-9b|remember]] me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. ^verse-9

**10**  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of [[#^note-10a|Assyria]]; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. ^verse-10

**11**  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of [[#^note-11a|Assyria]] shall be brought down, and the [[#^note-11b|sceptre]] of [[#^note-11c|Egypt]] shall depart away. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will [[#^note-12a|strengthen]] them in the Lord; and they shall walk up and down in his [[#^note-12b|name]], saith the Lord. ^verse-12
