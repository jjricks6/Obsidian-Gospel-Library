[[Old Testament/Joel|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 2|Next Entry]]

*Call a solemn assembly and gather to the house of the Lord, for the day of the Lord is at hand.*

**1**  The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. ^verse-1

**2**  Hear this, ye [[#^note-2a|old men]], and give ear, all ye [[#^note-2b|inhabitants]] of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? ^verse-2

**3**  Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|That]] which the palmerworm hath left hath the [[#^note-4b|locust]] eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. ^verse-4

**5**  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is [[#^note-5a|cut off]] from your mouth. ^verse-5

**6**  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without [[#^note-6a|number]], whose [[#^note-6b|teeth]] are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. ^verse-6

**7**  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the [[#^note-8a|husband]] of her youth. ^verse-8

**9**  The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's ministers, mourn. ^verse-9

**10**  The field is wasted, the [[#^note-10a|land]] mourneth; for the [[#^note-10b|corn]] is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. ^verse-10

**11**  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. ^verse-11

**12**  The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because [[#^note-12a|joy]] is withered away from the sons of men. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Gird]] yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Sanctify ye a [[#^note-14a|fast]], call a [[#^note-14b|solemn assembly]], gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord, ^verse-14

**15**  Alas for the [[#^note-15a|day]]! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. ^verse-15

**16**  Is not the [[#^note-16a|meat]] cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? ^verse-16

**17**  The seed is rotten under their clods, the [[#^note-17a|garners]] are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. ^verse-17

**18**  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. ^verse-18

**19**  O Lord, to thee will I cry: for the [[#^note-19a|fire]] hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. ^verse-19

**20**  The [[#^note-20a|beasts]] of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. ^verse-20
