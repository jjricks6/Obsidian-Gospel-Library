### Chapter 3

[[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Amos|Next Entry]]

*All nations will be at war—Multitudes will stand in the valley of decision as the Second Coming draws near—The Lord will dwell in Zion.*

**1**  For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall [[#^note-1a|bring again the captivity]] of Judah and Jerusalem, ^verse-1

**2**  I will also [[#^note-2a|gather]] all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will [[#^note-2b|plead]] with them there for my people and for my [[#^note-2c|heritage]] Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. ^verse-2

**3**  And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye [[#^note-4a|recompense]] me, swiftly and speedily will I return your [[#^note-4b|recompence]] upon your own head; ^verse-4

**5**  Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: ^verse-5

**6**  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: ^verse-7

**8**  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord hath spoken it. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare [[#^note-9a|war]], wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: ^verse-9

**10**  Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am [[#^note-10a|strong]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy [[#^note-11a|mighty]] ones to come down, O Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Let the [[#^note-12a|heathen]] be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to [[#^note-12b|judge]] all the heathen round about. ^verse-12

**13**  Put ye in the [[#^note-13a|sickle]], for the [[#^note-13b|harvest]] is ripe: come, get you down; for the [[#^note-13c|press]] is full, the [[#^note-13d|fats]] overflow; for their wickedness is great. ^verse-13

**14**  Multitudes, [[#^note-14a|multitudes]] in the valley of decision: for the [[#^note-14b|day]] of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|sun]] and the moon shall be [[#^note-15b|darkened]], and the stars shall withdraw their shining. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|Lord]] also shall [[#^note-16b|roar]] out of [[#^note-16c|Zion]], and [[#^note-16d|utter]] his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall [[#^note-16e|shake]]: but the Lord will be the [[#^note-16f|hope]] of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. ^verse-16

**17**  So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God [[#^note-17a|dwelling]] in Zion, my holy [[#^note-17b|mountain]]: then shall [[#^note-17c|Jerusalem]] be holy, and there shall no [[#^note-17d|strangers]] pass through her any more. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the [[#^note-18a|mountains]] shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a [[#^note-18b|fountain]] shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Egypt]] shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. ^verse-19

**20**  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. ^verse-20

**21**  For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in [[#^note-21a|Zion]]. ^verse-21
