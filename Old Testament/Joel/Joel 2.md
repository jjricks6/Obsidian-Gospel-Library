### Chapter 2

[[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Joel/Joel 3|Next Entry]]

*War and desolation will precede the Second Coming—The sun and the moon will be darkened—The Lord will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh—There will be dreams and visions.*

**1**  Blow ye the [[#^note-1a|trumpet]] in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy [[#^note-1b|mountain]]: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the [[#^note-1c|day]] of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand; ^verse-1

**2**  A day of [[#^note-2a|darkness]] and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. ^verse-2

**3**  A fire [[#^note-3a|devoureth]] before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of [[#^note-3b|Eden]] before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. ^verse-3

**4**  The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. ^verse-4

**5**  Like the [[#^note-5a|noise]] of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the [[#^note-5b|stubble]], as a strong people set in battle array. ^verse-5

**6**  Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather [[#^note-6a|blackness]]. ^verse-6

**7**  They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: ^verse-7

**8**  Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. ^verse-8

**9**  They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. ^verse-9

**10**  The [[#^note-10a|earth]] shall quake before them; the heavens shall [[#^note-10b|tremble]]: the [[#^note-10c|sun]] and the moon shall be [[#^note-10d|dark]], and the stars shall withdraw their shining: ^verse-10

**11**  And the Lord shall utter his [[#^note-11a|voice]] before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the [[#^note-11b|day]] of the Lord is [[#^note-11c|great]] and very terrible; and who can [[#^note-11d|abide]] it? ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Therefore also now, saith the Lord, [[#^note-12a|turn]] ye even to me with all your [[#^note-12b|heart]], and with [[#^note-12c|fasting]], and with weeping, and with mourning: ^verse-12

**13**  And [[#^note-13a|rend]] your heart, [[#^note-13b|and]] not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great [[#^note-13c|kindness]], and [[#^note-13d|repenteth]] him of the evil. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Who]] knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God? ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a [[#^note-15a|solemn assembly]]: ^verse-15

**16**  Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her [[#^note-16a|closet]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, [[#^note-17a|weep]] between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy [[#^note-17b|people]], O Lord, and give not thine heritage to [[#^note-17c|reproach]], that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Then will the Lord be [[#^note-18a|jealous]] for his land, and [[#^note-18b|pity]] his people. ^verse-18

**19**  Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: ^verse-19

**20**  But I will [[#^note-20a|remove]] far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the [[#^note-20b|east]] sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his [[#^note-20c|stink]] shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things. ^verse-21

**22**  Be not afraid, ye [[#^note-22a|beasts]] of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. ^verse-22

**23**  Be glad then, ye children of [[#^note-23a|Zion]], and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former [[#^note-23b|rain]] moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the [[#^note-23c|latter]] rain in the first month. ^verse-23

**24**  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the [[#^note-24a|fats]] shall overflow with wine and oil. ^verse-24

**25**  And I will [[#^note-25a|restore]] to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. ^verse-25

**26**  And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be [[#^note-26a|ashamed]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And ye shall know that I am in the [[#^note-27a|midst]] of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will [[#^note-28a|pour out]] my [[#^note-28b|spirit]] upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall [[#^note-28c|prophesy]], your [[#^note-28d|old]] men shall [[#^note-28e|dream]] dreams, your young men shall see [[#^note-28f|visions]]: ^verse-28

**29**  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. ^verse-29

**30**  And I will shew [[#^note-30a|wonders]] in the [[#^note-30b|heavens]] and in the earth, blood, and [[#^note-30c|fire]], and pillars of smoke. ^verse-30

**31**  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into [[#^note-31a|blood]], before the great and the terrible [[#^note-31b|day]] of the Lord come. ^verse-31

**32**  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall [[#^note-32a|call]] on the name of [[#^note-32b|the Lord]] shall be [[#^note-32c|delivered]]: for in [[#^note-32d|mount]] [[#^note-32e|Zion]] and in [[#^note-32f|Jerusalem]] shall be [[#^note-32g|deliverance]], as the Lord hath said, and in the [[#^note-32h|remnant]] whom the Lord shall [[#^note-32i|call]]. ^verse-32
