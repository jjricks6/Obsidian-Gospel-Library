*The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem—In the last days, the remnant of Jacob will triumph gloriously over the Gentiles.*

**1**  Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. ^verse-1

**2**  But thou, [[#^note-2a|Beth-lehem]] Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of [[#^note-2b|Judah]], yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be [[#^note-2c|ruler]] in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from [[#^note-2d|everlasting]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the [[#^note-3a|remnant]] of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And he shall stand and [[#^note-4a|feed]] in the [[#^note-4b|strength]] of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-4

**5**  And this man shall be the [[#^note-5a|peace]], when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. ^verse-5

**6**  And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of [[#^note-6a|Nimrod]] in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. ^verse-6

**7**  And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And the [[#^note-8a|remnant]] of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a [[#^note-8b|lion]] among the beasts of the forest, as a young [[#^note-8c|lion]] among the flocks of [[#^note-8d|sheep]]: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. ^verse-8

**9**  Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. ^verse-9

**10**  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy [[#^note-10a|horses]] out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: ^verse-10

**11**  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: ^verse-11

**12**  And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more [[#^note-12a|soothsayers]]: ^verse-12

**13**  Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will pluck up thy [[#^note-14a|groves]] out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. ^verse-15
