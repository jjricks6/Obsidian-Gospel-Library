### Chapter 7

[[Old Testament/Micah/Micah 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Nahum|Next Entry]]

*Though the people of Israel have rebelled, yet in the last days the Lord will have mercy on them—He will have compassion and pardon their iniquities.*

**1**  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. ^verse-1

**2**  The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his [[#^note-2a|brother]] with a net. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. ^verse-3

**4**  The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy [[#^note-4a|visitation]] cometh; now shall be their perplexity. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ [[#^note-5a|Trust]] ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. ^verse-5

**6**  For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's [[#^note-6a|enemies]] are the men of his own [[#^note-6b|house]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will [[#^note-7a|hear]] me. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in [[#^note-8a|darkness]], the Lord shall be a [[#^note-8b|light]] unto me. ^verse-8

**9**  I will [[#^note-9a|bear]] the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the [[#^note-9b|light]], and I shall behold his righteousness. ^verse-9

**10**  Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be [[#^note-10a|trodden]] down as the mire of the streets. ^verse-10

**11**  In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed. ^verse-11

**12**  In that day also he shall [[#^note-12a|come]] even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. ^verse-12

**13**  Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. ^verse-14

**15**  According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. ^verse-16

**17**  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of thee. ^verse-17

**18**  Who is a God like unto thee, that [[#^note-18a|pardoneth]] iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his [[#^note-18b|anger]] for ever, because he [[#^note-18c|delighteth]] in [[#^note-18d|mercy]]. ^verse-18

**19**  He will turn again, he will have [[#^note-19a|compassion]] upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to [[#^note-20a|Abraham]], which thou hast [[#^note-20b|sworn]] unto our fathers from the days of old. ^verse-20
