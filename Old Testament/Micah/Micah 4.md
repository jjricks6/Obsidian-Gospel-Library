*In the last days, the temple will be built, Israel will gather to it, the millennial era will commence, and the Lord will reign in Zion.*

**1**  But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the [[#^note-1a|mountain]] of the house of the Lord shall be [[#^note-1b|established]] in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. ^verse-1

**2**  And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the [[#^note-2a|mountain]] of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will [[#^note-2b|walk]] in his paths: for the [[#^note-2c|law]] shall go forth of [[#^note-2d|Zion]], and the word of the Lord from [[#^note-2e|Jerusalem]]. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their [[#^note-3a|swords]] into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn [[#^note-3b|war]] any more. ^verse-3

**4**  But they shall sit every man under his [[#^note-4a|vine]] and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. ^verse-4

**5**  For all people will walk every one in the [[#^note-5a|name]] of his god, and we will walk in the [[#^note-5b|name]] of the Lord our God for ever and ever. ^verse-5

**6**  In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that [[#^note-6a|halteth]], and I will [[#^note-6b|gather]] her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; ^verse-6

**7**  And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord shall [[#^note-7a|reign]] over them in mount [[#^note-7b|Zion]] from henceforth, even for ever. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. ^verse-8

**9**  Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. ^verse-9

**10**  Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in [[#^note-10a|travail]]: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to [[#^note-10b|Babylon]]; there shalt thou be delivered; there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine [[#^note-10c|enemies]]. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Now also many nations are [[#^note-11a|gathered]] against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. ^verse-11

**12**  But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. ^verse-12

**13**  Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt [[#^note-13a|beat]] in pieces many people: and I will [[#^note-13b|consecrate]] their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. ^verse-13
