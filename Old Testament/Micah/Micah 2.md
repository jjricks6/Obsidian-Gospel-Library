*The destruction of Israel is lamented—The Lord will gather the remnant of Israel.*

**1**  Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. ^verse-1

**2**  And they [[#^note-2a|covet]] [[#^note-2b|fields]], and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the Lord straitened? are these his doings? do not my [[#^note-7a|words]] do good to him that walketh uprightly? ^verse-7

**8**  Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men [[#^note-8a|averse]] from war. ^verse-8

**9**  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my [[#^note-9a|glory]] for ever. ^verse-9

**10**  Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your [[#^note-10a|rest]]: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. ^verse-10

**11**  If a man walking in the spirit and [[#^note-11a|falsehood]] do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the [[#^note-11b|prophet]] of this people. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely [[#^note-12a|gather]] the [[#^note-12b|remnant]] of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of [[#^note-12c|Bozrah]], as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. ^verse-12

**13**  The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their [[#^note-13a|king]] shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them. ^verse-13
