*In spite of all His goodness to them, the people have not served the Lord in spirit and in truth—They must act righteously, love mercy, and walk humbly before Him.*

**1**  Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. ^verse-1

**2**  Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's [[#^note-2a|controversy]], and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and he will [[#^note-2b|plead]] with Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. ^verse-3

**4**  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and [[#^note-4a|redeemed]] thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. ^verse-4

**5**  O my people, remember now what [[#^note-5a|Balak]] king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? ^verse-6

**7**  Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of [[#^note-7a|rams]], or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my [[#^note-7b|firstborn]] for my [[#^note-7c|transgression]], the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? ^verse-7

**8**  He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord [[#^note-8a|require]] of thee, but to do [[#^note-8b|justly]], and to love [[#^note-8c|mercy]], and to [[#^note-8d|walk]] [[#^note-8e|humbly]] with thy God? ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Are there yet the [[#^note-10a|treasures]] of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? ^verse-10

**11**  Shall I count them [[#^note-11a|pure]] with the wicked [[#^note-11b|balances]], and with the bag of deceitful weights? ^verse-11

**12**  For the rich men thereof are full of [[#^note-12a|violence]], and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou shalt eat, but not be [[#^note-14a|satisfied]]; and [[#^note-14b|thy]] casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou shalt [[#^note-15a|sow]], but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ For the statutes of [[#^note-16a|Omri]] are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a [[#^note-16b|desolation]], and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the [[#^note-16c|reproach]] of my people. ^verse-16
