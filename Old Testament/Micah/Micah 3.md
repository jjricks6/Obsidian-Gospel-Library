*Priests who teach for hire and prophets who divine for money bring a curse upon the people.*

**1**  And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? ^verse-1

**2**  Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; ^verse-2

**3**  Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. ^verse-3

**4**  Then shall they [[#^note-4a|cry]] unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord concerning the [[#^note-5a|prophets]] that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, [[#^note-5b|Peace]]; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare [[#^note-5c|war]] against him. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore [[#^note-6a|night]] shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not [[#^note-6b|divine]]; and the [[#^note-6c|sun]] shall go down over the [[#^note-6d|prophets]], and the day shall be dark over them. ^verse-6

**7**  Then shall the seers be [[#^note-7a|ashamed]], and the [[#^note-7b|diviners]] confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is [[#^note-7c|no]] answer of God. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ But truly I am full of [[#^note-8a|power]] by the [[#^note-8b|spirit]] of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his [[#^note-8c|transgression]], and to Israel his sin. ^verse-8

**9**  Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. ^verse-9

**10**  They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. ^verse-10

**11**  The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the [[#^note-11a|prophets]] thereof divine for [[#^note-11b|money]]: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore shall Zion for your [[#^note-12a|sake]] be [[#^note-12b|plowed]] as a field, and [[#^note-12c|Jerusalem]] shall become [[#^note-12d|heaps]], and the mountain of [[#^note-12e|the house]] as the high places of the forest. ^verse-12
