*The children of Israel intermarry with the Canaanites, worship false gods, and are cursed—Othniel judges the Israelites—They serve Moab and are delivered by Ehud, who slays Eglon.*

**1**  Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; ^verse-1

**2**  Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; ^verse-2

**3**  Namely, [[#^note-3a|five]] lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. ^verse-3

**4**  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And the children of Israel [[#^note-5a|dwelt]] among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: ^verse-5

**6**  And they took their daughters to be their wives, and [[#^note-6a|gave]] their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. ^verse-6

**7**  And the children of Israel did [[#^note-7a|evil]] in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and [[#^note-7b|served]] [[#^note-7c|Baalim]] and the [[#^note-7d|groves]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years. ^verse-8

**9**  And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a [[#^note-9a|deliverer]] to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. ^verse-9

**10**  And the [[#^note-10a|Spirit]] of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered [[#^note-10b|Chushan-rishathaim]] king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim. ^verse-10

**11**  And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. ^verse-13

**14**  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. ^verse-14

**15**  But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. ^verse-15

**16**  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. ^verse-16

**17**  And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. ^verse-17

**18**  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. ^verse-18

**19**  But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret [[#^note-19a|errand]] unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. ^verse-19

**20**  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. ^verse-20

**21**  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: ^verse-21

**22**  And the [[#^note-22a|haft]] also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. ^verse-22

**23**  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the [[#^note-23a|parlour]] upon him, and locked them. ^verse-23

**24**  When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. ^verse-24

**25**  And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. ^verse-25

**26**  And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. ^verse-26

**27**  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. ^verse-27

**28**  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. ^verse-28

**29**  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all [[#^note-29a|lusty]], and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. ^verse-29

**30**  So [[#^note-30a|Moab]] was [[#^note-30b|subdued]] that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest [[#^note-30c|fourscore]] years. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. ^verse-31
