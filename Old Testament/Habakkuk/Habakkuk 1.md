*When Habakkuk learns that the Lord will raise up the Chaldeans to overrun the land of Israel, he is troubled that the wicked can be thus employed.*

**1**  The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. ^verse-1

**2**  O Lord, [[#^note-2a|how]] long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of [[#^note-2b|violence]], and thou wilt not save! ^verse-2

**3**  Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up [[#^note-3a|strife]] and contention. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore the law [[#^note-4a|is slacked]], and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will [[#^note-5a|work]] a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. ^verse-5

**6**  For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs. ^verse-6

**7**  They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity [[#^note-7a|shall proceed of themselves]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. ^verse-8

**9**  They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather [[#^note-9a|the captivity]] as the sand. ^verse-9

**10**  And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. ^verse-10

**11**  Then shall his [[#^note-11a|mind]] change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? ^verse-13

**14**  And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? ^verse-14

**15**  They take up all of them with the [[#^note-15a|angle]], they catch them in their net, and gather them in their [[#^note-15b|drag]]: therefore they rejoice and are glad. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. ^verse-16

**17**  Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? ^verse-17
