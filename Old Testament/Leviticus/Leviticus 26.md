### Chapter 26

[[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 27|Next Entry]]

*Temporal and spiritual blessings will abound in Israel if the people keep the commandments—Cursing, scourging, and desolation will be theirs if they disobey the Lord—When His people repent, the Lord will show mercy unto them.*

**1**  Ye shall make you no [[#^note-1a|idols]] nor [[#^note-1b|graven image]], neither rear you up a [[#^note-1c|standing image]], neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and [[#^note-2a|reverence]] my sanctuary: I am the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ If ye [[#^note-3a|walk]] in my statutes, and [[#^note-3b|keep]] my commandments, and do them; ^verse-3

**4**  Then I will [[#^note-4a|give]] you [[#^note-4b|rain]] in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. ^verse-4

**5**  And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. ^verse-5

**6**  And I will [[#^note-6a|give]] [[#^note-6b|peace]] in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. ^verse-6

**7**  And ye shall chase your [[#^note-7a|enemies]], and they shall fall before you by the sword. ^verse-7

**8**  And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. ^verse-8

**9**  For I will [[#^note-9a|have respect unto you]], and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. ^verse-9

**10**  And ye shall eat old store, and [[#^note-10a|bring forth]] the old because of the new. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will [[#^note-12a|walk]] [[#^note-12b|among]] you, and will be your [[#^note-12c|God]], and ye shall be my [[#^note-12d|people]]. ^verse-12

**13**  I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your [[#^note-13a|yoke]], and made you go upright. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ But if ye will not [[#^note-14a|hearken]] unto me, and will not do all these [[#^note-14b|commandments]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye [[#^note-15a|break]] my covenant: ^verse-15

**16**  I also will [[#^note-16a|do]] this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, [[#^note-16b|consumption]], and [[#^note-16c|the burning ague]], that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. ^verse-16

**17**  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be [[#^note-17a|slain]] before your [[#^note-17b|enemies]]: they that hate you shall [[#^note-17c|reign]] over you; and ye shall [[#^note-17d|flee]] when none pursueth you. ^verse-17

**18**  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will [[#^note-18a|punish]] you seven times more for your sins. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will break the [[#^note-19a|pride]] of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: ^verse-19

**20**  And your strength shall be [[#^note-20a|spent]] in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And if ye walk [[#^note-21a|contrary]] unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more [[#^note-21b|plagues]] upon you according to your sins. ^verse-21

**22**  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your [[#^note-22a|high]] ways shall be desolate. ^verse-22

**23**  And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; ^verse-23

**24**  Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet [[#^note-24a|seven]] times for your sins. ^verse-24

**25**  And I will bring a [[#^note-25a|sword]] upon you, that shall [[#^note-25b|avenge]] the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the [[#^note-25c|enemy]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And when I have [[#^note-26a|broken]] the [[#^note-26b|staff]] of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be [[#^note-26c|satisfied]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; ^verse-27

**28**  Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will [[#^note-28a|chastise]] you seven times for your sins. ^verse-28

**29**  And ye shall [[#^note-29a|eat]] the [[#^note-29b|flesh]] of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. ^verse-29

**30**  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. ^verse-30

**31**  And I will make your cities [[#^note-31a|waste]], and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and [[#^note-31b|I]] will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. ^verse-31

**32**  And I will bring the [[#^note-32a|land]] into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. ^verse-32

**33**  And I will [[#^note-33a|scatter]] you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be [[#^note-33b|desolate]], and your cities waste. ^verse-33

**34**  Then shall the land enjoy her [[#^note-34a|sabbaths]], as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. ^verse-34

**35**  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. ^verse-35

**36**  And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. ^verse-36

**37**  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. ^verse-37

**38**  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your [[#^note-38a|enemies]] shall eat you up. ^verse-38

**39**  And they that are left of you shall [[#^note-39a|pine away]] in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. ^verse-39

**40**  If they shall [[#^note-40a|confess]] their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; ^verse-40

**41**  And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be [[#^note-41a|humbled]], and they then accept of the [[#^note-41b|punishment]] of their iniquity: ^verse-41

**42**  Then will I remember my [[#^note-42a|covenant]] with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with [[#^note-42b|Abraham]] will I remember; and I will remember the land. ^verse-42

**43**  The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. ^verse-43

**44**  And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their [[#^note-44a|enemies]], I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to [[#^note-44b|destroy]] them utterly, and to break my [[#^note-44c|covenant]] with them: for I am the Lord their God. ^verse-44

**45**  But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the [[#^note-45a|sight]] of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord. ^verse-45

**46**  These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. ^verse-46
