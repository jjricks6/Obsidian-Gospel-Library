*The Lord reveals the law of purification of women after childbirth, including a sin offering.*

**1**  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. ^verse-2

**3**  And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be [[#^note-3a|circumcised]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. ^verse-4

**5**  But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. ^verse-5

**6**  And when the days of her [[#^note-6a|purifying]] are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: ^verse-6

**7**  Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. ^verse-7

**8**  And if she be not [[#^note-8a|able]] to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an [[#^note-8b|atonement]] for her, and she shall be clean. ^verse-8
