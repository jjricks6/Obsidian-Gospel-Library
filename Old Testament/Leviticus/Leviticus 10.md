*Nadab and Abihu perform unauthorized sacrifices and are slain by a fire from the Lord—Aaron and his other sons are forbidden to mourn for them—Aaron and his sons are to abstain from wine and strong drink—They are to teach all that the Lord revealed to Moses.*

**1**  And Nadab and Abihu, the [[#^note-1a|sons]] of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered [[#^note-1b|strange]] fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. ^verse-1

**2**  And there went out [[#^note-2a|fire]] from the Lord, and [[#^note-2b|devoured]] them, and they [[#^note-2c|died]] before the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron [[#^note-3a|held]] his peace. ^verse-3

**4**  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of [[#^note-4a|Uzziel]] the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. ^verse-4

**5**  So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. ^verse-5

**6**  And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your [[#^note-6a|heads]], neither [[#^note-6b|rend]] your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled. ^verse-6

**7**  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the [[#^note-7a|anointing oil]] of the Lord is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, ^verse-8

**9**  Do not drink [[#^note-9a|wine]] nor [[#^note-9b|strong]] [[#^note-9c|drink]], thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations: ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|that]] ye may put difference between [[#^note-10b|holy]] and unholy, and between [[#^note-10c|unclean]] and [[#^note-10d|clean]]; ^verse-10

**11**  And that ye may [[#^note-11a|teach]] the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat [[#^note-12a|offering]] that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and [[#^note-12b|eat it without leaven]] beside the altar: for it is most holy: ^verse-12

**13**  And ye shall [[#^note-13a|eat]] it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded. ^verse-13

**14**  And the [[#^note-14a|wave breast]] and heave shoulder shall ye [[#^note-14b|eat]] in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|The]] heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made [[#^note-15b|by]] fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And Moses [[#^note-16a|diligently]] sought the [[#^note-16b|goat]] of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to [[#^note-17a|bear]] the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord? ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. ^verse-18

**19**  And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things have [[#^note-19a|befallen]] me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been [[#^note-19b|accepted]] in the sight of the Lord? ^verse-19

**20**  And when Moses heard that, he was content. ^verse-20
