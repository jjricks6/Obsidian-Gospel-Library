[[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Leviticus/Leviticus 22|Next Entry]]

*The priests are to be holy—The high priest is not to marry a widow, a divorced person, or a harlot—Descendants of Aaron with physical blemishes may not offer the bread of God upon the altar.*

**1**  And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the [[#^note-1a|dead]] [[#^note-1b|among his people]]: ^verse-1

**2**  But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, ^verse-2

**3**  And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. ^verse-3

**4**  But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. ^verse-4

**5**  They shall not make [[#^note-5a|baldness]] upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their [[#^note-5b|flesh]]. ^verse-5

**6**  They shall be [[#^note-6a|holy]] unto their God, and not [[#^note-6b|profane]] the name of their God: for the offerings of the Lord made by [[#^note-6c|fire]], and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. ^verse-6

**7**  They shall not take a wife that is a [[#^note-7a|whore]], or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou shalt [[#^note-8a|sanctify]] him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the Lord, which sanctify you, am holy. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be [[#^note-9a|burnt]] with fire. ^verse-9

**10**  And he that is the [[#^note-10a|high priest]] among his brethren, upon whose head the [[#^note-10b|anointing oil]] was poured, and [[#^note-10c|that is consecrated]] to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; ^verse-10

**11**  Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; ^verse-11

**12**  Neither shall he go out of the [[#^note-12a|sanctuary]], nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the [[#^note-12b|crown]] of the [[#^note-12c|anointing oil]] of his God is upon him: I am the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And he shall take a wife in her virginity. ^verse-13

**14**  A [[#^note-14a|widow]], or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. ^verse-14

**15**  Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the Lord do sanctify him. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ^verse-16

**17**  Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any [[#^note-17a|blemish]], let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. ^verse-17

**18**  For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing [[#^note-18a|superfluous]], ^verse-18

**19**  Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, ^verse-19

**20**  Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; ^verse-20

**21**  No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. ^verse-21

**22**  He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. ^verse-22

**23**  Only he shall not go in unto the [[#^note-23a|veil]], nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the Lord do sanctify them. ^verse-23

**24**  And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. ^verse-24
