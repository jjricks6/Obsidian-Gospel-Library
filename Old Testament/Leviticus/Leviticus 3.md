*Peace offerings are made with animals without blemish, whose blood is sprinkled on the altar—Israel is forbidden to eat fat or blood.*

**1**  And if his oblation be a [[#^note-1a|sacrifice]] of peace [[#^note-1b|offering]], if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it [[#^note-1c|without blemish]] before the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and [[#^note-2a|Aaron's]] sons the priests shall [[#^note-2b|sprinkle]] the blood upon the altar round about. ^verse-2

**3**  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, ^verse-3

**4**  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^verse-4

**5**  And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without [[#^note-6a|blemish]]. ^verse-6

**7**  If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. ^verse-8

**9**  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, ^verse-9

**10**  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^verse-10

**11**  And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the [[#^note-11a|food]] of the offering made by [[#^note-11b|fire]] unto the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. ^verse-13

**14**  And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, ^verse-14

**15**  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^verse-15

**16**  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord's. ^verse-16

**17**  It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither [[#^note-17a|fat]] nor [[#^note-17b|blood]]. ^verse-17
