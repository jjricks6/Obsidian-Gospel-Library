*Many waters cannot quench love.*

**1**  O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. ^verse-1

**2**  I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. ^verse-2

**3**  His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. ^verse-3

**4**  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. ^verse-4

**5**  Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is [[#^note-6a|cruel]] as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. ^verse-6

**7**  Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? ^verse-8

**9**  If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. ^verse-9

**10**  I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. ^verse-10

**11**  Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. ^verse-11

**12**  My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young [[#^note-14a|hart]] upon the mountains of spices. ^verse-14
