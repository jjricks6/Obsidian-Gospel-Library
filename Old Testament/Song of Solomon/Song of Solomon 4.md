*A song describes the beauty of the poet's beloved.*

**1**  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. ^verse-1

**2**  Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them. ^verse-2

**3**  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. ^verse-3

**4**  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. ^verse-4

**5**  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. ^verse-5

**6**  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Come with me from Lebanon, my [[#^note-8a|spouse]], with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou hast ravished [[#^note-9a|my]] heart, my [[#^note-9b|sister]], my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. ^verse-9

**10**  How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! ^verse-10

**11**  Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. ^verse-11

**12**  A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. ^verse-12

**13**  Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; [[#^note-13a|camphire]], with [[#^note-13b|spikenard]], ^verse-13

**14**  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: ^verse-14

**15**  A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. ^verse-16
