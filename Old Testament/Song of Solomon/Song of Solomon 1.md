[[Old Testament/Song of Solomon|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Song of Solomon/Song of Solomon 2|Next Entry]]

*The poet sings of love and devotion.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|song]] of songs, which is Solomon's. ^verse-1

**2**  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. ^verse-2

**3**  Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. ^verse-4

**5**  I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. ^verse-5

**6**  Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. ^verse-6

**7**  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. ^verse-8

**9**  I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. ^verse-9

**10**  Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold. ^verse-10

**11**  We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ While the king sitteth at his table, my [[#^note-12a|spikenard]] sendeth forth the smell thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. ^verse-13

**14**  My beloved is unto me as a cluster of [[#^note-14a|camphire]] in the vineyards of En-gedi. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. ^verse-16

**17**  The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. ^verse-17
