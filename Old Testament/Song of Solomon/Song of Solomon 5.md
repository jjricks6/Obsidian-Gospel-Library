*The song of love and affection continues.*

**1**  I am come into my garden, my [[#^note-1a|sister]], my [[#^note-1b|spouse]]: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. ^verse-2

**3**  I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? ^verse-3

**4**  My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. ^verse-4

**5**  I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. ^verse-5

**6**  I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. ^verse-6

**7**  The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. ^verse-7

**8**  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? ^verse-9

**10**  My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. ^verse-10

**11**  His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. ^verse-11

**12**  His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. ^verse-12

**13**  His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. ^verse-13

**14**  His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. ^verse-14

**15**  His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. ^verse-15

**16**  His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. ^verse-16
