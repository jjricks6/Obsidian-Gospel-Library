*The Lord will pour out judgments upon Moab, Judah, and Israel for their unrighteousness.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of [[#^note-1a|Moab]], and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: ^verse-1

**2**  But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: ^verse-2

**3**  And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have [[#^note-4a|despised]] the law of the Lord, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked: ^verse-4

**5**  But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they [[#^note-6a|sold]] the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; ^verse-6

**7**  That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to [[#^note-7a|profane]] my holy name: ^verse-7

**8**  And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Yet [[#^note-9a|destroyed]] I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. ^verse-9

**10**  Also I [[#^note-10a|brought]] you up from the land of Egypt, and led you [[#^note-10b|forty]] years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. ^verse-10

**11**  And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for [[#^note-11a|Nazarites]]. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. ^verse-12

**13**  Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore the [[#^note-14a|flight]] shall perish from the [[#^note-14b|swift]], and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty [[#^note-14c|deliver]] himself: ^verse-14

**15**  Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not [[#^note-15a|deliver]] himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. ^verse-15

**16**  And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the Lord. ^verse-16
