*Amos shows the Lord's judgments upon Syria, the Philistines, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon.*

**1**  The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of [[#^note-1a|Uzziah]] king of Judah, and in the days of [[#^note-1b|Jeroboam]] the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the [[#^note-1c|earthquake]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And he said, The Lord will [[#^note-2a|roar]] from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the [[#^note-2b|habitations]] of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. ^verse-2

**3**  Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have [[#^note-3a|threshed]] Gilead with threshing instruments of iron: ^verse-3

**4**  But I will send a fire into the house of [[#^note-4a|Hazael]], which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. ^verse-4

**5**  I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom: ^verse-6

**7**  But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof: ^verse-7

**8**  And I will cut off the inhabitant from [[#^note-8a|Ashdod]], and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the [[#^note-8b|Philistines]] shall perish, saith the Lord God. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of [[#^note-9a|Tyrus]], and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the [[#^note-9b|brotherly]] covenant: ^verse-9

**10**  But I will send a fire on the wall of [[#^note-10a|Tyrus]], which shall devour the palaces thereof. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of [[#^note-11a|Edom]], and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: ^verse-11

**12**  But I will send a fire upon [[#^note-12a|Teman]], which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border: ^verse-13

**14**  But I will kindle a fire in the wall of [[#^note-14a|Rabbah]], and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: ^verse-14

**15**  And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the Lord. ^verse-15
