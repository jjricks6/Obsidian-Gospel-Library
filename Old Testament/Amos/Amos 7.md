*Amos relates how he was called of God to be a prophet—He prophesies the captivity of Israel.*

**1**  Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. ^verse-1

**2**  And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|The]] Lord [[#^note-3b|repented]] for this: It shall not be, saith the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord God called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. ^verse-4

**5**  Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|The]] Lord repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord God. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. ^verse-7

**8**  And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again [[#^note-8a|pass]] by them any more: ^verse-8

**9**  And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the [[#^note-9a|house]] of Jeroboam with the sword. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to [[#^note-10a|Jeroboam]] king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. ^verse-10

**11**  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. ^verse-11

**12**  Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou [[#^note-12a|seer]], go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: ^verse-12

**13**  But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's [[#^note-13a|chapel]], and it is the king's court. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no [[#^note-14a|prophet]], neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|Lord]] took me as I followed the flock, and the Lord said unto me, [[#^note-15b|Go]], [[#^note-15c|prophesy]] unto my people Israel. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and [[#^note-17a|Israel]] shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. ^verse-17
