*The Lord withholds rain, sends famine and pestilence, and destroys gardens and vineyards as judgments upon His people, yet they do not return unto the Lord.*

**1**  Hear this word, ye [[#^note-1a|kine]] of Bashan, that are in the mountain of [[#^note-1b|Samaria]], which oppress the [[#^note-1c|poor]], which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord God hath sworn by his [[#^note-2a|holiness]], that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. ^verse-2

**3**  And ye shall go out at the [[#^note-3a|breaches]], every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Come to Beth-el, and transgress; at [[#^note-4a|Gilgal]] multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your [[#^note-4b|tithes]] after three [[#^note-4c|years]]: ^verse-4

**5**  And offer a sacrifice of [[#^note-5a|thanksgiving]] with [[#^note-5b|leaven]], and proclaim and publish the [[#^note-5c|free]] offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord God. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And I also have given you [[#^note-6a|cleanness]] of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not [[#^note-6b|returned]] unto me, saith the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  And also I have withholden the [[#^note-7a|rain]] from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. ^verse-7

**8**  So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your [[#^note-10a|young]] men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  I have overthrown some of you, as God [[#^note-11a|overthrew]] [[#^note-11b|Sodom]] and Gomorrah, and ye were as a [[#^note-11c|firebrand]] plucked out of the [[#^note-11d|burning]]: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. ^verse-12

**13**  For, lo, he that [[#^note-13a|formeth]] the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his [[#^note-13b|thought]], that maketh the [[#^note-13c|morning]] [[#^note-13d|darkness]], and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The Lord, The God of hosts, is his name. ^verse-13
