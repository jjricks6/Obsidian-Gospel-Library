[[Old Testament/Amos/Amos 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Obadiah|Next Entry]]

*Israel will be sifted among all nations—In the last days, the people of Israel will be gathered again into their own land, and it will become productive.*

**1**  I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will [[#^note-1a|slay]] the last of them with the sword: he that [[#^note-1b|fleeth]] of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. ^verse-1

**2**  Though they dig into [[#^note-2a|hell]], thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: ^verse-2

**3**  And though they [[#^note-3a|hide]] themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: ^verse-3

**4**  And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for [[#^note-4a|evil]], and not for good. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall [[#^note-5a|melt]], and all that dwell therein shall [[#^note-5b|mourn]]: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. ^verse-5

**6**  It is he that buildeth his [[#^note-6a|stories]] in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the [[#^note-6b|waters]] of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name. ^verse-6

**7**  Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, the [[#^note-8a|eyes]] of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will [[#^note-8b|destroy]] it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly [[#^note-8c|destroy]] the house of Jacob, saith the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  For, lo, I will command, and I will [[#^note-9a|sift]] the house of [[#^note-9b|Israel]] among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain [[#^note-9c|fall]] upon the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor [[#^note-10a|prevent]] us. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ In that day will I raise up the [[#^note-11a|tabernacle]] of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: ^verse-11

**12**  That they may [[#^note-12a|possess]] the remnant of [[#^note-12b|Edom]], and of all the [[#^note-12c|heathen]], which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doeth this. ^verse-12

**13**  Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that [[#^note-13a|soweth]] seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall [[#^note-13b|melt]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And I will bring again the [[#^note-14a|captivity]] of my people of [[#^note-14b|Israel]], and they shall [[#^note-14c|build]] the [[#^note-14d|waste]] cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will [[#^note-15a|plant]] them upon their [[#^note-15b|land]], and they shall [[#^note-15c|no more]] be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God. ^verse-15
