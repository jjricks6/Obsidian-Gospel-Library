*The people of Israel are exhorted to seek the Lord and do good so that they may live—Their sacrifices to false gods are abhorrent.*

**1**  Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. ^verse-1

**2**  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up. ^verse-2

**3**  For thus saith the Lord God; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, [[#^note-4a|Seek]] ye me, and ye shall live: ^verse-4

**5**  But seek not [[#^note-5a|Beth-el]], nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Seek]] the Lord, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el. ^verse-6

**7**  Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, ^verse-7

**8**  Seek him that maketh [[#^note-8a|the]] seven [[#^note-8b|stars]] and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the [[#^note-8c|morning]], and maketh the day [[#^note-8d|dark]] with night: that calleth for the [[#^note-8e|waters]] of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: [[#^note-8f|The Lord]] is his name: ^verse-8

**9**  That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. ^verse-9

**10**  They hate him that rebuketh in the [[#^note-10a|gate]], and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. ^verse-10

**11**  Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have [[#^note-11a|built]] houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not [[#^note-11b|dwell]] in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. ^verse-11

**12**  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a [[#^note-12a|bribe]], and they [[#^note-12b|turn]] aside the [[#^note-12c|poor]] in the gate from their right. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore the [[#^note-13a|prudent]] shall keep [[#^note-13b|silence]] in that time; for it is an evil time. ^verse-13

**14**  Seek [[#^note-14a|good]], and not [[#^note-14b|evil]], that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. ^verse-14

**15**  Hate the evil, and [[#^note-15a|love]] the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of [[#^note-15b|Joseph]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. ^verse-16

**17**  And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  Woe unto you that [[#^note-18a|desire]] the [[#^note-18b|day]] of the Lord! to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is [[#^note-18c|darkness]], and not light. ^verse-18

**19**  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. ^verse-19

**20**  Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ I hate, I despise your [[#^note-21a|feast]] days, and [[#^note-21b|I]] will not smell in your [[#^note-21c|solemn assemblies]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Though ye [[#^note-22a|offer]] me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not [[#^note-22b|accept]] them: neither will I regard the peace [[#^note-22c|offerings]] of your fat beasts. ^verse-22

**23**  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. ^verse-23

**24**  But let [[#^note-24a|judgment]] run down as waters, and [[#^note-24b|righteousness]] as a mighty stream. ^verse-24

**25**  Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? ^verse-25

**26**  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your [[#^note-26a|Moloch]] and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. ^verse-26

**27**  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose name is The God of hosts. ^verse-27
