*Amos prophesies the downfall of Israel—There will be a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.*

**1**  Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit. ^verse-1

**2**  And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The [[#^note-2a|end]] is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again [[#^note-2b|pass]] by them any more. ^verse-2

**3**  And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail, ^verse-4

**5**  Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the [[#^note-5a|sabbath]], that we may set forth wheat, making the [[#^note-5b|ephah]] small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the [[#^note-5c|balances]] by deceit? ^verse-5

**6**  That we may [[#^note-6a|buy]] the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat? ^verse-6

**7**  The Lord hath sworn by the [[#^note-7a|excellency]] of Jacob, Surely I will never [[#^note-7b|forget]] any of their works. ^verse-7

**8**  Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one [[#^note-8a|mourn]] that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall [[#^note-8b|be]] cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that I will cause the [[#^note-9a|sun]] to go down at noon, and I will [[#^note-9b|darken]] the [[#^note-9c|earth]] in the clear day: ^verse-9

**10**  And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into [[#^note-10a|lamentation]]; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and [[#^note-10b|baldness]] upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an [[#^note-10c|only]] son, and the end thereof as a bitter day. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a [[#^note-11a|famine]] in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a [[#^note-11b|thirst]] for water, but of hearing the [[#^note-11c|words]] of the Lord: ^verse-11

**12**  And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall [[#^note-12a|run]] to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. ^verse-12

**13**  In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. ^verse-13

**14**  They that [[#^note-14a|swear]] by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O [[#^note-14b|Dan]], liveth; and, The manner of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again. ^verse-14
