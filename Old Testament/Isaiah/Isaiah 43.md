[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 42|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 44|Next Entry]]

*To Israel the Lord says, I am your God; I will gather your descendants; beside me there is no Savior; you are my witnesses.*

**1**  But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have [[#^note-1a|redeemed thee]], I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. ^verse-1

**2**  When thou passest through the [[#^note-2a|waters]], I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the [[#^note-2b|fire]], thou shalt not be [[#^note-2c|burned]]; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. ^verse-2

**3**  For I am the Lord thy God, the [[#^note-3a|Holy One]] of Israel, thy [[#^note-3b|Saviour]]: I gave [[#^note-3c|Egypt]] for thy [[#^note-3d|ransom]], Ethiopia and [[#^note-3e|Seba]] for thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Since thou wast [[#^note-4a|precious]] in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Fear not]]: for I am with thee: I will [[#^note-5b|bring]] thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; ^verse-5

**6**  I will say to the [[#^note-6a|north]], [[#^note-6b|Give up]]; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; ^verse-6

**7**  Even every one that is called by my name: for I have [[#^note-7a|created]] him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. ^verse-8

**9**  Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Ye]] are my [[#^note-10b|witnesses]], saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have [[#^note-10c|chosen]]: that ye may know and [[#^note-10d|believe]] me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. ^verse-10

**11**  I, even I, am the Lord; and [[#^note-11a|beside]] me there is no [[#^note-11b|saviour]]. ^verse-11

**12**  I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. ^verse-12

**13**  Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall [[#^note-13a|let it]]? ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, your [[#^note-14a|redeemer]], the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. ^verse-14

**15**  I am the Lord, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your [[#^note-15a|King]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Thus saith the Lord, which [[#^note-16a|maketh]] a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; ^verse-16

**17**  Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall [[#^note-17a|lie down]] together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are [[#^note-17b|quenched as tow]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. ^verse-18

**19**  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the [[#^note-19a|wilderness]], and [[#^note-19b|rivers]] in the desert. ^verse-19

**20**  The beast of the field shall honour me, the [[#^note-20a|dragons and the owls]]: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. ^verse-20

**21**  This [[#^note-21a|people]] have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. ^verse-22

**23**  Thou hast not brought me the [[#^note-23a|small cattle]] of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. ^verse-23

**24**  Thou hast bought me no [[#^note-24a|sweet cane]] with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast [[#^note-24b|made]] me to serve with thy sins, thou hast [[#^note-24c|wearied]] me with thine iniquities. ^verse-24

**25**  I, even I, am he that [[#^note-25a|blotteth]] out thy [[#^note-25b|transgressions]] for mine own [[#^note-25c|sake]], and will not remember thy sins. ^verse-25

**26**  Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: [[#^note-26a|declare]] thou, that thou mayest be justified. ^verse-26

**27**  Thy [[#^note-27a|first father]] hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. ^verse-27

**28**  Therefore I have [[#^note-28a|profaned]] the [[#^note-28b|princes]] of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. ^verse-28
