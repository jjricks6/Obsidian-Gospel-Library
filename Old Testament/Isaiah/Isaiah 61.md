*Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—The Messiah will have the Spirit, preach the gospel, and proclaim liberty—In the last days, the Lord will call His ministers and make an everlasting covenant with the people.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|Spirit]] of the Lord [[#^note-1b|God]] is upon me; because the Lord hath [[#^note-1c|anointed]] me to [[#^note-1d|preach]] [[#^note-1e|good tidings]] unto the [[#^note-1f|meek]]; he hath sent me to [[#^note-1g|bind]] up the brokenhearted, to [[#^note-1h|proclaim]] [[#^note-1i|liberty]] to the [[#^note-1j|captives]], and the opening of the [[#^note-1k|prison]] to them that are bound; ^verse-1

**2**  To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of [[#^note-2a|vengeance]] of our God; to [[#^note-2b|comfort]] all that [[#^note-2c|mourn]]; ^verse-2

**3**  To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them [[#^note-3a|beauty]] for ashes, the oil of [[#^note-3b|joy]] for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called [[#^note-3c|trees]] of [[#^note-3d|righteousness]], the [[#^note-3e|planting]] of the Lord, that he might be glorified. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And they shall [[#^note-4a|build]] the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. ^verse-4

**5**  And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. ^verse-5

**6**  But ye shall be named the [[#^note-6a|Priests]] of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the [[#^note-6b|riches]] of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ For your shame ye shall have [[#^note-7a|double]]; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess [[#^note-7b|the double]]: everlasting joy shall be unto them. ^verse-7

**8**  For I the Lord love [[#^note-8a|judgment]], I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting [[#^note-8b|covenant]] with them. ^verse-8

**9**  And their [[#^note-9a|seed]] shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed. ^verse-9

**10**  I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath [[#^note-10a|clothed]] me with the [[#^note-10b|garments]] of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. ^verse-10

**11**  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and [[#^note-11a|praise]] to spring forth before all the nations. ^verse-11
