[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 45|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 47|Next Entry]]

*Idols are not to be compared with the Lord—He alone is God and will save Israel.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Bel]] boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a [[#^note-1b|burden]] to the weary beast. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|They]] stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the [[#^note-3a|remnant]] of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb: ^verse-3

**4**  And even to your [[#^note-4a|old]] age I am he; and even to [[#^note-4b|hoar hairs]] will I [[#^note-4c|carry]] you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will [[#^note-4d|deliver]] you. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ To whom will ye [[#^note-5a|liken]] me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? ^verse-5

**6**  They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they [[#^note-6a|worship]]. ^verse-6

**7**  They [[#^note-7a|bear]] him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall [[#^note-7b|cry]] unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. ^verse-7

**8**  Remember this, and shew yourselves [[#^note-8a|men]]: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Remember]] the [[#^note-9b|former]] things of old: for [[#^note-9c|I am]] God, and there is [[#^note-9d|none]] else; I am God, and there is none like me, ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Declaring]] the [[#^note-10b|end]] from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My [[#^note-10c|counsel]] shall stand, and I will do all my [[#^note-10d|pleasure]]: ^verse-10

**11**  Calling a [[#^note-11a|ravenous bird]] from the [[#^note-11b|east]], the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have [[#^note-11c|spoken]] it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Hearken unto me, ye [[#^note-12a|stouthearted]], that are far from righteousness: ^verse-12

**13**  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my [[#^note-13a|salvation]] shall not [[#^note-13b|tarry]]: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. ^verse-13
