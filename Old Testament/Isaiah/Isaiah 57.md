*When the righteous die, they enter into peace—Mercy is promised to the penitent—There is no peace for the wicked.*

**1**  The righteous [[#^note-1a|perisheth]], and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. ^verse-1

**2**  He shall enter into [[#^note-2a|peace]]: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ But draw near hither, ye [[#^note-3a|sons]] of the sorceress, the seed of the [[#^note-3b|adulterer]] and the whore. ^verse-3

**4**  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not [[#^note-4a|children]] of transgression, a seed of falsehood, ^verse-4

**5**  Enflaming yourselves with [[#^note-5a|idols]] under every green tree, [[#^note-5b|slaying]] the [[#^note-5c|children]] in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks? ^verse-5

**6**  Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these? ^verse-6

**7**  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy [[#^note-7a|bed]]: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. ^verse-7

**8**  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast [[#^note-8a|discovered]] thyself to [[#^note-8b|another]] than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. ^verse-8

**9**  And thou wentest to the [[#^note-9a|king]] with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no [[#^note-10a|hope]]: thou hast found the [[#^note-10b|life of thine hand]]; therefore thou wast not grieved. ^verse-10

**11**  And of whom hast thou been afraid or [[#^note-11a|feared]], that thou hast [[#^note-11b|lied]], and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? ^verse-11

**12**  I will [[#^note-12a|declare]] thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy [[#^note-13a|mountain]]; ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|And shall say]], Cast ye up, cast ye up, [[#^note-14b|prepare]] the way, take up the [[#^note-14c|stumblingblock]] out of the way of my people. ^verse-14

**15**  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth [[#^note-15a|eternity]], whose name is [[#^note-15b|Holy]]; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a [[#^note-15c|contrite]] and [[#^note-15d|humble]] spirit, to [[#^note-15e|revive]] the spirit of the [[#^note-15f|humble]], and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. ^verse-15

**16**  For I will not [[#^note-16a|contend]] for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the [[#^note-16b|souls]] which I have made. ^verse-16

**17**  For the [[#^note-17a|iniquity]] of his [[#^note-17b|covetousness]] was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on [[#^note-17c|frowardly]] in the way of his heart. ^verse-17

**18**  I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will [[#^note-18a|lead]] him also, and restore [[#^note-18b|comforts]] unto him and to his [[#^note-18c|mourners]]. ^verse-18

**19**  I create the [[#^note-19a|fruit]] of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is [[#^note-19b|far]] off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him. ^verse-19

**20**  But the [[#^note-20a|wicked]] are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ^verse-20

**21**  There is no [[#^note-21a|peace]], saith my God, to the wicked. ^verse-21
