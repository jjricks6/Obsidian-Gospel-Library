*Isaiah speaks as the Messiah—He will have the tongue of the learned—He will give His back to the smiters—He will not be confounded—Compare 2 Nephi 7.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Thus]] saith the Lord, Where is the bill of your mother's [[#^note-1b|divorcement]], whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your [[#^note-1c|iniquities]] have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your [[#^note-1d|mother]] put away. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my [[#^note-2a|hand]] shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no [[#^note-2b|power]] to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I [[#^note-2c|dry up]] the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst. ^verse-2

**3**  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the [[#^note-4a|learned]], that I should know how to speak a [[#^note-4b|word]] in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ The Lord God hath opened mine [[#^note-5a|ear]], and I was not [[#^note-5b|rebellious]], neither turned away back. ^verse-5

**6**  I [[#^note-6a|gave]] my [[#^note-6b|back]] to the [[#^note-6c|smiters]], and my [[#^note-6d|cheeks]] to them that plucked off the hair: I [[#^note-6e|hid]] not my face from [[#^note-6f|shame]] and [[#^note-6g|spitting]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ For the Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. ^verse-7

**8**  He is near that [[#^note-8a|justifieth]] me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. ^verse-8

**9**  Beh[[#^note-9a|old]], the Lord God will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the [[#^note-9b|moth]] shall eat them up. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the [[#^note-10a|voice]] of his [[#^note-10b|servant]], that walketh in [[#^note-10c|darkness]], and hath no [[#^note-10d|light]]? let him [[#^note-10e|trust]] in the name of the Lord, and [[#^note-10f|stay upon]] his God. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the [[#^note-11a|light]] of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in [[#^note-11b|sorrow]]. ^verse-11
