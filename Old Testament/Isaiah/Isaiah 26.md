### Chapter 26

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 27|Next Entry]]

*Trust in the Lord forever—Jehovah will die and be resurrected—All men will rise in the Resurrection.*

**1**  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for [[#^note-1a|walls]] and bulwarks. ^verse-1

**2**  Open ye the [[#^note-2a|gates]], that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou wilt keep him in perfect [[#^note-3a|peace]], whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord [[#^note-4a|Jehovah]] is [[#^note-4b|everlasting]] [[#^note-4c|strength]]: ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. ^verse-5

**6**  The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. ^verse-6

**7**  The way of the just is [[#^note-7a|upright]]ness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we [[#^note-8a|waited]] for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. ^verse-8

**9**  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I [[#^note-9a|seek]] thee [[#^note-9b|early]]: for when thy [[#^note-9c|judgments]] are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. ^verse-9

**10**  Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, [[#^note-11a|they]] will not see: but they shall see, and be [[#^note-11b|ashamed]] for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our [[#^note-12a|works]] in us. ^verse-12

**13**  O Lord our God, other [[#^note-13a|lords]] beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|They]] are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou hast [[#^note-15a|increased]] the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst [[#^note-15b|removed]] it far unto all the ends of the earth. ^verse-15

**16**  Lord, in [[#^note-16a|trouble]] have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy [[#^note-16b|chastening]] was upon them. ^verse-16

**17**  Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world [[#^note-18a|fallen]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Thy dead men shall [[#^note-19a|live]], together with [[#^note-19b|my]] dead body shall they [[#^note-19c|arise]]. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, [[#^note-20a|until]] the indignation be overpast. ^verse-20

**21**  For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her [[#^note-21a|blood]], and shall no more cover her slain. ^verse-21
