### Chapter 1

[[Old Testament/Isaiah|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 2|Next Entry]]

*The people of Israel are apostate, rebellious, and corrupt; only a few remain faithful—The people's sacrifices and feasts are rejected—They are called upon to repent and work righteousness—Zion will be redeemed in the day of restoration.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|vision]] of [[#^note-1b|Isaiah]] the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning [[#^note-1c|Judah]] and Jerusalem in the days of [[#^note-1d|Uzziah]], [[#^note-1e|Jotham]], [[#^note-1f|Ahaz]], and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Hear]], O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have [[#^note-2b|rebelled]] against me. ^verse-2

**3**  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's [[#^note-3a|crib]]: but Israel doth not [[#^note-3b|know]], my people doth not consider. ^verse-3

**4**  Ah [[#^note-4a|sinful]] nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, [[#^note-4b|children]] that are [[#^note-4c|corrupters]]: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto [[#^note-4d|anger]], they are gone away backward. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Why should ye be [[#^note-5a|stricken]] any more? ye will [[#^note-5b|revolt]] more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart [[#^note-5c|faint]]. ^verse-5

**6**  From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been [[#^note-6a|closed]], neither bound up, neither [[#^note-6b|mollified]] with ointment. ^verse-6

**7**  Your [[#^note-7a|country]] is [[#^note-7b|desolate]], your cities are burned with fire: your land, [[#^note-7c|strangers]] devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. ^verse-7

**8**  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a [[#^note-8a|vineyard]], [[#^note-8b|a]]s a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. ^verse-8

**9**  Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small [[#^note-9a|remnant]], we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of [[#^note-10a|Sodom]]; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. ^verse-10

**11**  To what purpose is the multitude of your [[#^note-11a|sacrifices]] unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I [[#^note-11b|delight]] not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. ^verse-11

**12**  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? ^verse-12

**13**  Bring no more [[#^note-13a|vain]] [[#^note-13b|oblations]]; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and [[#^note-13c|sabbaths]], the calling of [[#^note-13d|assemblies]], I cannot [[#^note-13e|away with]]; it is [[#^note-13f|iniquity]], even the [[#^note-13g|solemn meeting]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Your new [[#^note-14a|moons]] and your appointed [[#^note-14b|feasts]] my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am [[#^note-14c|weary]] to bear them. ^verse-14

**15**  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many [[#^note-15a|prayers]], I will not hear: your hands are full of [[#^note-15b|blood]]. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ [[#^note-16a|Wash]] you, make you [[#^note-16b|clean]]; put away the [[#^note-16c|evil]] of your doings from before mine eyes; [[#^note-16d|cease]] to do evil; ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Learn]] to do [[#^note-17b|well]]; seek [[#^note-17c|judgment]], [[#^note-17d|relieve]] the oppressed, [[#^note-17e|judge the fatherless]], plead for the [[#^note-17f|widow]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Come now, and let us [[#^note-18a|reason]] together, saith the Lord: though your [[#^note-18b|sins]] be as scarlet, they shall be as [[#^note-18c|white]] as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. ^verse-18

**19**  If ye be [[#^note-19a|willing]] and [[#^note-19b|obedient]], ye shall eat the [[#^note-19c|good]] of the land: ^verse-19

**20**  But if ye refuse and [[#^note-20a|rebel]], ye shall be [[#^note-20b|devoured]] with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ How is the faithful city become an [[#^note-21a|harlot]]! it was full of [[#^note-21b|judgment]]; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. ^verse-21

**22**  Thy silver is become [[#^note-22a|dross]], thy wine mixed with water: ^verse-22

**23**  Thy [[#^note-23a|princes]] are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth [[#^note-23b|gifts]], and followeth after rewards: they [[#^note-23c|judge not]] the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine [[#^note-24a|adversaries]], and avenge me of mine enemies: ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And I will [[#^note-25a|turn my hand upon]] thee, and purely [[#^note-25b|purge]] away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: ^verse-25

**26**  And I will [[#^note-26a|restore]] thy judges as at the first, and thy [[#^note-26b|counsellors]] as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The [[#^note-26c|city of righteousness]], the faithful city. ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|Zion]] shall be redeemed with [[#^note-27b|judgment]], and her [[#^note-27c|converts]] with righteousness. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed. ^verse-28

**29**  For they shall be ashamed of the [[#^note-29a|oaks]] which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. ^verse-29

**30**  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. ^verse-30

**31**  And the strong shall be [[#^note-31a|as tow]], and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both [[#^note-31b|burn]] together, and none shall quench them. ^verse-31
