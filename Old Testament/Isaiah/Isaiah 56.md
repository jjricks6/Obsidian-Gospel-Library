[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 55|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 57|Next Entry]]

*All who keep the commandments will be exalted—Other people will join Israel—The Lord will gather others to the house of Israel.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do [[#^note-1a|justice]]: for my salvation is [[#^note-1b|near]] to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. ^verse-1

**2**  Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the [[#^note-2a|sabbath]] from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any [[#^note-2b|evil]]. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Neither let the [[#^note-3a|son]] of the [[#^note-3b|stranger]], that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. ^verse-3

**4**  For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; ^verse-4

**5**  Even unto them will I give in mine [[#^note-5a|house]] and within my walls a place and a name better than of [[#^note-5b|sons]] and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. ^verse-5

**6**  Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; ^verse-6

**7**  Even them will I bring to my holy [[#^note-7a|mountain]], and make them joyful in my [[#^note-7b|house]] of [[#^note-7c|prayer]]: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be [[#^note-7d|accepted]] upon mine altar; for mine [[#^note-7e|house]] sh[[#^note-7f|all]] be called an house of prayer for all [[#^note-7g|people]]. ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord God which [[#^note-8a|gathereth]] the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather [[#^note-8b|others]] to him, beside those that are gathered unto him. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ [[#^note-9a|All]] ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest. ^verse-9

**10**  His [[#^note-10a|watchmen]] are [[#^note-10b|blind]]: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, they are [[#^note-11a|greedy]] dogs which can never have enough, and they are [[#^note-11b|shepherds]] that cannot understand: they all look to their [[#^note-11c|own]] way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. ^verse-11

**12**  Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. ^verse-12
