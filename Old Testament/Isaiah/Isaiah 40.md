[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 39|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 41|Next Entry]]

*Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—Prepare ye the way of the Lord—He will feed His flock like a shepherd—Israel's God is incomparably great.*

**1**  Comfort ye, [[#^note-1a|comfort]] ye my people, saith your God. ^verse-1

**2**  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her [[#^note-2a|warfare]] is accomplished, that her iniquity is [[#^note-2b|pardoned]]: for she hath received of the Lord's hand [[#^note-2c|double]] for all her sins. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ The [[#^note-3a|voice]] of him that crieth in the wilderness, [[#^note-3b|Prepare]] ye the [[#^note-3c|way]] of the Lord, make straight in the desert a [[#^note-3d|highway]] for our God. ^verse-3

**4**  Every [[#^note-4a|valley]] shall be [[#^note-4b|exalted]], and every [[#^note-4c|mountain]] and hill shall be made [[#^note-4d|low]]: and the [[#^note-4e|crooked]] shall be made straight, and [[#^note-4f|the rough places plain]]: ^verse-4

**5**  And the [[#^note-5a|glory]] of the Lord shall be [[#^note-5b|revealed]], and all flesh shall [[#^note-5c|see]] it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. ^verse-5

**6**  The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All [[#^note-6a|flesh]] is [[#^note-6b|grass]], and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: ^verse-6

**7**  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. ^verse-7

**8**  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the [[#^note-8a|word]] of our God shall stand for ever. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ O [[#^note-9a|Zion]], that bringest [[#^note-9b|good]] [[#^note-9c|tidings]], get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of [[#^note-9d|Judah]], Behold your God! ^verse-9

**10**  Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his [[#^note-10a|arm]] shall rule for him: behold, his [[#^note-10b|reward]] is with him, and his work before him. ^verse-10

**11**  He shall feed his [[#^note-11a|flock]] like a [[#^note-11b|shepherd]]: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? ^verse-12

**13**  Who hath [[#^note-13a|directed]] the [[#^note-13b|Spirit]] of the Lord, or being his [[#^note-13c|counsellor]] hath taught him? ^verse-13

**14**  With whom took he [[#^note-14a|counsel]], and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of [[#^note-14b|judgment]], and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, the [[#^note-15a|nations]] are as a [[#^note-15b|drop]] of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the [[#^note-15c|isles]] as a very little thing. ^verse-15

**16**  And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. ^verse-16

**17**  All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and [[#^note-17a|vanity]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ To whom then will ye [[#^note-18a|liken]] God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? ^verse-18

**19**  The workman melteth a graven image, and the [[#^note-19a|goldsmith]] spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. ^verse-19

**20**  He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that [[#^note-20a|shall]] not be moved. ^verse-20

**21**  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? ^verse-21

**22**  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that [[#^note-22a|stretcheth]] out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: ^verse-22

**23**  That bringeth the [[#^note-23a|princes]] to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. ^verse-23

**24**  Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. ^verse-24

**25**  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. ^verse-25

**26**  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by [[#^note-26a|names]] by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth. ^verse-26

**27**  Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is [[#^note-27a|passed over from]] my God? ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the [[#^note-28a|everlasting]] God, the Lord, the [[#^note-28b|Creator]] of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no [[#^note-28c|searching]] of his understanding. ^verse-28

**29**  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. ^verse-29

**30**  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: ^verse-30

**31**  But they that [[#^note-31a|wait upon]] the Lord shall [[#^note-31b|renew]] their [[#^note-31c|strength]]; they shall mount up with wings as [[#^note-31d|eagles]]; they shall [[#^note-31e|run]], and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. ^verse-31
