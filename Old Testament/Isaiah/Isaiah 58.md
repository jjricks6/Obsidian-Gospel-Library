[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 57|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 59|Next Entry]]

*The true law of the fast, with its purposes and attendant blessings, is set forth—The commandment to keep the Sabbath is given.*

**1**  Cry aloud, [[#^note-1a|spare]] not, lift up thy [[#^note-1b|voice]] like a [[#^note-1c|trumpet]], and [[#^note-1d|shew]] my people their [[#^note-1e|transgression]], and the house of Jacob their sins. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Yet]] they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the [[#^note-2b|ordinances]] of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ [[#^note-3a|Wherefore]] have we [[#^note-3b|fast]]ed, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find [[#^note-3c|pleasure]], and [[#^note-3d|exact all your labours]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, ye fast for [[#^note-4a|strife]] and [[#^note-4b|debate]], and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not [[#^note-4c|fast]] as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. ^verse-4

**5**  Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? ^verse-5

**6**  Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the [[#^note-6a|bands]] of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go [[#^note-6b|free]], and that ye break every yoke? ^verse-6

**7**  Is it not to deal thy bread to the [[#^note-7a|hungry]], and that thou bring the [[#^note-7b|poor]] that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from [[#^note-7c|thine own flesh]]? ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Then shall thy [[#^note-8a|light]] break forth as the morning, and thine [[#^note-8b|health]] shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy [[#^note-8c|rearward]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Then shalt thou [[#^note-9a|call]], and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the [[#^note-9b|putting]] forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; ^verse-9

**10**  And if thou draw out thy soul to the [[#^note-10a|hungry]], and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light [[#^note-10b|rise in obscurity]], and thy darkness be as the noonday: ^verse-10

**11**  And the Lord shall [[#^note-11a|guide]] thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in [[#^note-11b|drought]], and [[#^note-11c|make fat]] thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a [[#^note-11d|spring]] of water, whose waters fail not. ^verse-11

**12**  And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ If thou turn away thy foot from the [[#^note-13a|sabbath]], from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: ^verse-13

**14**  Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the [[#^note-14a|high places]] of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. ^verse-14
