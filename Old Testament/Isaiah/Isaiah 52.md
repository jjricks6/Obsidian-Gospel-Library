[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 51|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 53|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, Zion will return, and Israel will be redeemed—The Messiah will deal prudently and be exalted.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Awake]], awake; put on thy [[#^note-1b|strength]], O [[#^note-1c|Zion]]; put on thy [[#^note-1d|beautiful]] [[#^note-1e|garments]], O [[#^note-1f|Jerusalem]], the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Shake]] thyself from the dust; [[#^note-2b|arise, and sit down]], O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the [[#^note-2c|bands]] of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. ^verse-2

**3**  For thus saith the Lord, Ye have [[#^note-3a|sold]] yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without [[#^note-3b|money]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For thus saith the Lord [[#^note-4a|God]], My people went down aforetime into [[#^note-4b|Egypt]] to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. ^verse-4

**5**  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the Lord; and my name continually every day is [[#^note-5a|blasphemed]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that [[#^note-6a|day]] that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ How [[#^note-7a|beautiful]] upon the mountains are the feet of him that [[#^note-7b|bringeth]] [[#^note-7c|good]] [[#^note-7d|tidings]], that [[#^note-7e|publisheth]] [[#^note-7f|peace]]; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto [[#^note-7g|Zion]], Thy God reigneth! ^verse-7

**8**  Thy [[#^note-8a|watchmen]] shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall [[#^note-8b|see]] eye to eye, when the Lord [[#^note-8c|shall bring again]] [[#^note-8d|Zion]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Break forth into joy, sing together, ye [[#^note-9a|waste places]] of Jerusalem: for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. ^verse-9

**10**  The Lord hath made [[#^note-10a|bare]] his holy [[#^note-10b|arm]] in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall [[#^note-10c|see]] the [[#^note-10d|salvation]] of our God. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Depart ye, depart ye, go ye [[#^note-11a|out]] from thence, [[#^note-11b|touch]] no [[#^note-11c|unclean thing]]; go ye [[#^note-11d|out]] of the midst of her; be ye [[#^note-11e|clean]], that bear the vessels of the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  For ye shall not go out with [[#^note-12a|haste]], nor go by flight: for the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your [[#^note-12b|rearward]]. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Behold, my [[#^note-13a|servant]] shall deal [[#^note-13b|prudently]], he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. ^verse-13

**14**  As many were [[#^note-14a|astonied]] at thee; his [[#^note-14b|visage]] was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: ^verse-14

**15**  So shall he [[#^note-15a|sprinkle]] many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been [[#^note-15b|told]] them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. ^verse-15
