### Chapter 29

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 28|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 30|Next Entry]]

*A people (the Nephites) will speak as a voice from the dust—The Apostasy, restoration of the gospel, and coming forth of a sealed book (the Book of Mormon) are foretold—Compare 2 Nephi 27.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Woe]] to [[#^note-1b|Ariel]], to Ariel, the city [[#^note-1c|where]] David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. ^verse-1

**2**  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and [[#^note-2a|sorrow]]: and it shall be unto me as Ariel. ^verse-2

**3**  And I will [[#^note-3a|camp]] against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. ^verse-3

**4**  And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the [[#^note-4a|dust]], and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the [[#^note-4b|ground]], and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. ^verse-4

**5**  Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring [[#^note-6a|fire]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. ^verse-7

**8**  It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that [[#^note-8a|fight]] against mount [[#^note-8b|Zion]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are [[#^note-9a|drunken]], but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. ^verse-9

**10**  For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep [[#^note-10a|sleep]], and hath closed your [[#^note-10b|eyes]]: the [[#^note-10c|prophets]] and your rulers, the [[#^note-10d|seers]] hath he [[#^note-10e|covered]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a [[#^note-11a|book]] that is [[#^note-11b|sealed]], which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: ^verse-11

**12**  And the book is delivered to [[#^note-12a|him]] that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people [[#^note-13a|draw near]] me with their [[#^note-13b|mouth]], and with their lips do [[#^note-13c|honour]] me, but have [[#^note-13d|removed]] their [[#^note-13e|heart]] far from me, and their [[#^note-13f|fear toward me]] is taught by the [[#^note-13g|precept]] of men: ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a [[#^note-14a|marvellous]] [[#^note-14b|work]] among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the [[#^note-14c|wisdom]] of their wise men shall [[#^note-14d|perish]], and the [[#^note-14e|understanding]] of their [[#^note-14f|prudent]] men shall be hid. ^verse-14

**15**  Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their [[#^note-15a|counsel]] from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who [[#^note-15b|seeth]] us? and who knoweth us? ^verse-15

**16**  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the [[#^note-16a|work]] say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? ^verse-16

**17**  Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And in that [[#^note-18a|day]] shall the deaf hear the words of the [[#^note-18b|book]], and the [[#^note-18c|eyes]] of the blind shall see out of [[#^note-18d|obscurity]], and out of darkness. ^verse-18

**19**  The meek also shall increase their [[#^note-19a|joy]] in the Lord, and the [[#^note-19b|poor]] among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. ^verse-19

**20**  For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that [[#^note-20a|watch]] for iniquity are [[#^note-20b|cut off]]: ^verse-20

**21**  That make a man an [[#^note-21a|offender]] for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in [[#^note-21b|the gate]], and [[#^note-21c|turn]] aside the just for a thing of nought. ^verse-21

**22**  Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the [[#^note-22a|house of Jacob]], Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. ^verse-22

**23**  But when he seeth his children, the [[#^note-23a|work]] of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall [[#^note-23b|fear]] the [[#^note-23c|God]] of Israel. ^verse-23

**24**  They also that [[#^note-24a|erred]] in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall [[#^note-24b|learn]] doctrine. ^verse-24
