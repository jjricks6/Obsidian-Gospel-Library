*Babylon and Chaldea will be destroyed for their iniquities—No one will save them.*

**1**  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of [[#^note-1a|Babylon]], sit on the ground: there is no [[#^note-1b|throne]], O [[#^note-1c|daughter of the Chaldeans]]: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Take]] the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, [[#^note-2b|pass over the rivers]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: [[#^note-3a|I]] will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man. ^verse-3

**4**  As for our redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. ^verse-4

**5**  Sit thou silent, and [[#^note-5a|get thee into darkness]], O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and [[#^note-6a|given]] them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And thou saidst, I shall be [[#^note-7a|a lady]] for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter [[#^note-7b|end]] of it. ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a [[#^note-8a|widow]], neither shall I know the [[#^note-8b|loss of children]]: ^verse-8

**9**  But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee [[#^note-9a|in their perfection]] for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None [[#^note-10a|seeth]] me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and [[#^note-11a|mischief]] shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and [[#^note-11b|desolation]] shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know. ^verse-11

**12**  Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the [[#^note-13a|astrologers]], the stargazers, the [[#^note-13b|monthly]] prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, they shall be as [[#^note-14a|stubble]]; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. ^verse-14

**15**  Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee. ^verse-15
