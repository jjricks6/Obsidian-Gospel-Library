### Chapter 62

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 61|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 63|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, Israel will be gathered—Zion will be established—Her watchmen will teach about the Lord—The gospel standard will be lifted up—The people will be called holy, the redeemed of the Lord.*

**1**  For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Gentiles shall [[#^note-2a|see]] thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new [[#^note-2b|name]], which the mouth of the Lord shall name. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou shalt also be a [[#^note-3a|crown]] of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou shalt no more be termed [[#^note-4a|Forsaken]]; neither shall thy [[#^note-4b|land]] any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called [[#^note-4c|Hephzi-bah]], and thy land [[#^note-4d|Beulah]]: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom [[#^note-5a|rejoice]]th over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. ^verse-5

**6**  I have set [[#^note-6a|watchmen]] upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, ^verse-6

**7**  And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a [[#^note-7a|praise]] in the earth. ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: ^verse-8

**9**  But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my [[#^note-9a|holiness]]. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Go through, go through the gates; [[#^note-10a|prepare]] ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the [[#^note-10b|highway]]; gather out the stones; lift up a [[#^note-10c|standard]] for the people. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the [[#^note-11a|world]], Say ye to the [[#^note-11b|daughter]] of Zion, Behold, thy [[#^note-11c|salvation]] cometh; behold, his [[#^note-11d|reward]] is with him, and his work before him. ^verse-11

**12**  And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken. ^verse-12
