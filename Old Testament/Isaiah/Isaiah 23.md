*Tyre will be overthrown.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|burden]] of [[#^note-1b|Tyre]]. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of [[#^note-1c|Chittim]] it is revealed to them. ^verse-1

**2**  Be [[#^note-2a|still]], ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. ^verse-2

**3**  And by great waters the [[#^note-3a|seed]] of [[#^note-3b|Sihor]], the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. ^verse-3

**4**  Be thou ashamed, O [[#^note-4a|Zidon]]: for the sea hath spoken, even the [[#^note-4b|strength]] of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|As]] at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. ^verse-5

**6**  Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. ^verse-6

**7**  Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. ^verse-7

**8**  Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are [[#^note-8a|princes]], whose [[#^note-8b|traffickers]] are the [[#^note-8c|honourable]] of the earth? ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength. ^verse-10

**11**  He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the Lord hath given a commandment [[#^note-11a|against the merchant city]], to destroy the strong holds thereof. ^verse-11

**12**  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest. ^verse-12

**13**  Behold the land of the [[#^note-13a|Chaldeans]]; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin. ^verse-13

**14**  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. ^verse-14

**15**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot. ^verse-15

**16**  Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. ^verse-16

**17**  Â¶ And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall [[#^note-17a|turn]] to her hire, and shall commit [[#^note-17b|fornication]] with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. ^verse-17

**18**  And [[#^note-18a|her]] merchandise and her [[#^note-18b|hire]] shall be [[#^note-18c|holiness]] to the Lord: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing. ^verse-18
