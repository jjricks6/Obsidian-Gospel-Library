[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 31|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 33|Next Entry]]

*A king (the Messiah) will reign in righteousness—The land of Israel will be a wilderness until the day of restoration and gathering.*

**1**  Behold, a [[#^note-1a|king]] shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in [[#^note-1b|judgment]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And [[#^note-2a|a man]] shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. ^verse-2

**3**  And the [[#^note-3a|eyes]] of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. ^verse-3

**4**  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. ^verse-4

**5**  The vile person shall be no more called [[#^note-5a|liberal]], nor the [[#^note-5b|churl]] said to be [[#^note-5c|bountiful]]. ^verse-5

**6**  For the vile person will speak [[#^note-6a|villany]], and his heart will work iniquity, to practise [[#^note-6b|hypocrisy]], and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. ^verse-6

**7**  The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with [[#^note-7a|lying]] words, even when the needy speaketh right. ^verse-7

**8**  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Rise up, ye [[#^note-9a|women]] that are at ease; hear my voice, ye [[#^note-9b|careless]] daughters; give ear unto my speech. ^verse-9

**10**  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall [[#^note-10a|fail]], the gathering shall not come. ^verse-10

**11**  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird [[#^note-11a|sackcloth]] upon your loins. ^verse-11

**12**  They shall [[#^note-12a|lament for the teats]], for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. ^verse-12

**13**  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: ^verse-13

**14**  Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city [[#^note-14a|shall be left]]; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; ^verse-14

**15**  Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a [[#^note-15a|fruitful]] field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. ^verse-15

**16**  Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field. ^verse-16

**17**  And the work of righteousness shall be [[#^note-17a|peace]]; and the effect of righteousness quietness and [[#^note-17b|assurance]] for ever. ^verse-17

**18**  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places; ^verse-18

**19**  When it shall [[#^note-19a|hail]], coming down on the forest; and the [[#^note-19b|city]] shall be low in a low place. ^verse-19

**20**  Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass. ^verse-20
