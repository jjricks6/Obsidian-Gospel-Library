*Moab will be laid waste, and her people will howl and weep.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|burden]] of [[#^note-1b|Moab]]. Because in the night [[#^note-1c|Ar]] of [[#^note-1d|Moab]] is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; ^verse-1

**2**  He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be [[#^note-2a|baldness]], and every beard [[#^note-2b|cut off]]. ^verse-2

**3**  In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly. ^verse-3

**4**  And Heshbon shall [[#^note-4a|cry]], and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him. ^verse-4

**5**  My [[#^note-5a|heart]] shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an [[#^note-5b|heifer]] of three years old: for by [[#^note-5c|the]] mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of [[#^note-5d|Horonaim]] they shall raise up a cry of destruction. ^verse-5

**6**  For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the [[#^note-7a|brook of the willows]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto [[#^note-8a|Beer-elim]]. ^verse-8

**9**  For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. ^verse-9
