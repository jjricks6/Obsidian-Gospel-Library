*The people of Israel are separated from their God by iniquity—Their sins testify against them—The Messiah will intercede, come to Zion, and redeem the repentant.*

**1**  Behold, the Lord's [[#^note-1a|hand]] is not [[#^note-1b|shortened]], that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot [[#^note-1c|hear]]: ^verse-1

**2**  But your iniquities have [[#^note-2a|separated]] between you and your God, and your [[#^note-2b|sins]] [[#^note-2c|have hid]] his face from you, that he will not [[#^note-2d|hear]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For your hands are defiled with [[#^note-3a|blood]], and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. ^verse-3

**4**  None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they [[#^note-4a|trust]] in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive [[#^note-4b|mischief]], and bring forth iniquity. ^verse-4

**5**  They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. ^verse-5

**6**  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. ^verse-6

**7**  Their feet [[#^note-7a|run]] to [[#^note-7b|evil]], and they make [[#^note-7c|haste]] to [[#^note-7d|shed]] innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. ^verse-7

**8**  The way of [[#^note-8a|peace]] they know not; and there is no [[#^note-8b|judgment]] in their goings: they have made them [[#^note-8c|crooked]] paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth [[#^note-9a|justice]] overtake us: we wait for [[#^note-9b|light]], but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we [[#^note-9c|walk]] in darkness. ^verse-9

**10**  We [[#^note-10a|grope]] for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. ^verse-10

**11**  We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. ^verse-11

**12**  For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins [[#^note-12a|testify]] against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we [[#^note-12b|know]] them; ^verse-12

**13**  In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. ^verse-13

**14**  And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and [[#^note-14a|equity]] cannot enter. ^verse-14

**15**  Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And he saw that there was [[#^note-16a|no man]], and wondered that there was no [[#^note-16b|intercessor]]: therefore his [[#^note-16c|arm]] [[#^note-16d|brought]] [[#^note-16e|salvation]] unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. ^verse-16

**17**  For he put on [[#^note-17a|righteousness]] as a [[#^note-17b|breastplate]], and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. ^verse-17

**18**  According to their [[#^note-18a|deeds]], accordingly he will [[#^note-18b|repay]], fury to his adversaries, [[#^note-18c|recompence]] to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. ^verse-18

**19**  So shall they [[#^note-19a|fear]] the [[#^note-19b|name]] of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the [[#^note-19c|Spirit]] of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And the [[#^note-20a|Redeemer]] shall [[#^note-20b|come]] to [[#^note-20c|Zion]], and unto them that [[#^note-20d|turn]] from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  As for me, this is my [[#^note-21a|covenant]] with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever. ^verse-21
