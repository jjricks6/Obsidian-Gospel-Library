*Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—The Lord will bring His law and His justice, be a light to the Gentiles, and free the prisoners—Praise the Lord.*

**1**  Behold my [[#^note-1a|servant]], whom I uphold; mine [[#^note-1b|elect]], in whom my soul delighteth; I have [[#^note-1c|put]] my [[#^note-1d|spirit]] upon him: he shall bring forth [[#^note-1e|judgment]] to the Gentiles. ^verse-1

**2**  He shall not cry, nor [[#^note-2a|lift up]], nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|A]] bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. ^verse-3

**4**  He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the [[#^note-4a|isles]] shall wait for his law. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Thus saith God the Lord, he that [[#^note-5a|created]] the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth [[#^note-5b|breath]] unto the people upon it, and [[#^note-5c|spirit]] to them that [[#^note-5d|walk]] therein: ^verse-5

**6**  I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a [[#^note-6a|covenant]] of the people, for a [[#^note-6b|light]] of the [[#^note-6c|Gentiles]]; ^verse-6

**7**  To [[#^note-7a|open]] the [[#^note-7b|blind]] eyes, to bring out the [[#^note-7c|prisoners]] from the [[#^note-7d|prison]], and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. ^verse-7

**8**  I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, the [[#^note-9a|former]] things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell [[#^note-9b|you]] of them. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Sing]] unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. ^verse-10

**11**  Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. ^verse-11

**12**  Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands. ^verse-12

**13**  The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up [[#^note-13a|jealousy]] like a man of [[#^note-13b|war]]: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. ^verse-13

**14**  I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and [[#^note-14a|refrained]] myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will [[#^note-14b|destroy]] and devour at once. ^verse-14

**15**  I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. ^verse-15

**16**  And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make [[#^note-16a|darkness]] light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. ^verse-17

**18**  Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Who]] is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is [[#^note-19b|perfect]], and blind as the Lord's servant? ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Seeing]] many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not. ^verse-20

**21**  The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it [[#^note-21a|honourable]]. ^verse-21

**22**  But this is a [[#^note-22a|people]] robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, [[#^note-22b|Restore]]. ^verse-22

**23**  Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come? ^verse-23

**24**  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and [[#^note-24a|Israel]] to the robbers? did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not [[#^note-24b|walk]] in his ways, neither were they [[#^note-24c|obedient]] unto his law. ^verse-24

**25**  Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. ^verse-25
