*In the day of restoration, the desert will blossom, the Lord will come, Israel will be gathered, and Zion will be built up.*

**1**  The wilderness and the [[#^note-1a|solitary]] place shall be [[#^note-1b|glad]] for [[#^note-1c|them]]; and the [[#^note-1d|desert]] shall rejoice, and [[#^note-1e|blossom]] as the rose. ^verse-1

**2**  It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of [[#^note-2a|Lebanon]] shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the [[#^note-2b|glory]] of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. ^verse-2

**3**  Â¶ Strengthen ye the [[#^note-3a|weak]] hands, and confirm the [[#^note-3b|feeble]] knees. ^verse-3

**4**  Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with [[#^note-4a|vengeance]], even God with a recompence; he will come and save you. ^verse-4

**5**  Then the [[#^note-5a|eyes]] of the [[#^note-5b|blind]] shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. ^verse-5

**6**  Then shall the lame man leap as an [[#^note-6a|hart]], and the tongue of the dumb [[#^note-6b|sing]]: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. ^verse-6

**7**  And the [[#^note-7a|parched]] ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the [[#^note-7b|habitation of dragons]], where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. ^verse-7

**8**  And an [[#^note-8a|highway]] shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of [[#^note-8b|holiness]]; the [[#^note-8c|unclean]] shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. ^verse-8

**9**  No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the [[#^note-9a|redeemed]] shall walk there: ^verse-9

**10**  And the ransomed of the Lord shall [[#^note-10a|return]], and come to [[#^note-10b|Zion]] with [[#^note-10c|songs]] and everlasting [[#^note-10d|joy]] upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and [[#^note-10e|sorrow]] and sighing shall flee away. ^verse-10
