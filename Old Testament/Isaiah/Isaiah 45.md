*Cyrus will free the captives of Israel from Babylon—Come unto Jehovah (Christ) and be saved—To Him every knee will bow and every tongue will take an oath.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord to his [[#^note-1a|anointed]], to [[#^note-1b|Cyrus]], whose right hand I have [[#^note-1c|holden]], to [[#^note-1d|subdue]] nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the [[#^note-1e|two leaved gates]]; and the gates shall not be shut; ^verse-1

**2**  I will go before thee, and make the [[#^note-2a|crooked]] places straight: I will [[#^note-2b|break]] in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: ^verse-2

**3**  And I will give thee the [[#^note-3a|treasures of darkness]], and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy [[#^note-3b|name]], am the [[#^note-3c|God]] of Israel. ^verse-3

**4**  For Jacob my [[#^note-4a|servant's]] sake, and Israel mine [[#^note-4b|elect]], I have even [[#^note-4c|called]] thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ [[#^note-5a|I am]] the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: ^verse-5

**6**  That they may know from the [[#^note-6a|rising]] of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else. ^verse-6

**7**  I form the [[#^note-7a|light]], and create darkness: I make peace, and create [[#^note-7b|evil]]: I the Lord do all these things. ^verse-7

**8**  Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down [[#^note-8a|righteousness]]: let the earth open, and let [[#^note-8b|them]] bring forth [[#^note-8c|salvation]], and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it. ^verse-8

**9**  Woe unto him that [[#^note-9a|striveth]] with his [[#^note-9b|Maker]]! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the [[#^note-9c|clay]] say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? ^verse-9

**10**  Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to [[#^note-10a|the woman]], What hast thou brought forth? ^verse-10

**11**  Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my [[#^note-11a|sons]], and concerning the [[#^note-11b|work]] of my hands [[#^note-11c|command ye me]]. ^verse-11

**12**  I have [[#^note-12a|made]] the earth, and [[#^note-12b|created]] man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their [[#^note-12c|host]] have I commanded. ^verse-12

**13**  I have raised [[#^note-13a|him]] up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall [[#^note-13b|build]] my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for [[#^note-13c|price]] nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts. ^verse-13

**14**  Thus saith the Lord, The labour of [[#^note-14a|Egypt]], and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come [[#^note-14b|after]] thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is [[#^note-14c|none]] else, there is no God. ^verse-14

**15**  Verily thou art a God that [[#^note-15a|hidest]] thyself, O God of Israel, the [[#^note-15b|Saviour]]. ^verse-15

**16**  They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of [[#^note-16a|idols]]. ^verse-16

**17**  But Israel shall be [[#^note-17a|saved]] in the [[#^note-17b|Lord]] with an everlasting [[#^note-17c|salvation]]: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. ^verse-17

**18**  For thus saith the Lord that [[#^note-18a|created]] the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be [[#^note-18b|inhabited]]: I am the Lord; and there is none else. ^verse-18

**19**  I have not spoken in [[#^note-19a|secret]], in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the Lord speak [[#^note-19b|righteousness]], I declare things that are [[#^note-19c|right]]. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are [[#^note-20a|escaped]] of the [[#^note-20b|nations]]: they have no [[#^note-20c|knowledge]] that set up the wood of their graven image, and [[#^note-20d|pray]] unto a god that cannot save. ^verse-20

**21**  Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me; a [[#^note-21a|just]] God and a [[#^note-21b|Saviour]]; there is none beside me. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Look]] unto me, and be ye [[#^note-22b|saved]], all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. ^verse-22

**23**  I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every [[#^note-23a|knee]] shall bow, every tongue shall [[#^note-23b|swear]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and [[#^note-24a|strength]]: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. ^verse-24

**25**  In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be [[#^note-25a|justified]], and shall glory. ^verse-25
