[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 50|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 52|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, the Lord will comfort Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed will come to Zion amid great joy—Compare 2 Nephi 8.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Hearken]] to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the [[#^note-1b|rock]] whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. ^verse-1

**2**  Look unto [[#^note-2a|Abraham]] your [[#^note-2b|father]], and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him [[#^note-2c|alone]], and [[#^note-2d|blessed]] him, and increased him. ^verse-2

**3**  For the Lord shall [[#^note-3a|comfort]] [[#^note-3b|Zion]]: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like [[#^note-3c|Eden]], and her desert like the [[#^note-3d|garden]] of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a [[#^note-4a|law]] shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. ^verse-4

**5**  My righteousness is near; my [[#^note-5a|salvation]] is gone forth, and mine arms shall [[#^note-5b|judge]] the people; the [[#^note-5c|isles]] shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. ^verse-5

**6**  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall [[#^note-6a|vanish away]] like smoke, and the earth shall [[#^note-6b|wax]] [[#^note-6c|old]] like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose [[#^note-7a|heart]] is my law; [[#^note-7b|fear]] ye not the [[#^note-7c|reproach]] of [[#^note-7d|men]], neither be ye afraid of their [[#^note-7e|revilings]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For the [[#^note-8a|moth]] shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Awake, awake, put on [[#^note-9a|strength]], O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the [[#^note-9b|dragon]]? ^verse-9

**10**  Art thou not it which hath [[#^note-10a|dried]] the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a [[#^note-10b|way]] for the [[#^note-10c|ransomed]] to pass over? ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore the [[#^note-11a|redeemed]] of the Lord shall [[#^note-11b|return]], and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting [[#^note-11c|joy]] shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and [[#^note-11d|mourning]] shall flee away. ^verse-11

**12**  I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be [[#^note-12a|afraid]] of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; ^verse-12

**13**  And [[#^note-13a|forgettest]] the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the [[#^note-13b|earth]]; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? ^verse-13

**14**  The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the [[#^note-14a|pit]], nor that his bread should fail. ^verse-14

**15**  But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the [[#^note-15a|sea]], whose waves roared: The Lord of hosts is his name. ^verse-15

**16**  And I have put my [[#^note-16a|words]] in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the [[#^note-17a|cup]] of his [[#^note-17b|fury]]; thou hast drunken the dregs of the [[#^note-17c|cup]] of trembling, and wrung them out. ^verse-17

**18**  There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up. ^verse-18

**19**  These [[#^note-19a|two]] things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? ^verse-19

**20**  Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a [[#^note-20a|wild bull]] in a net: they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: ^verse-21

**22**  Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that [[#^note-22a|pleadeth]] the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: ^verse-22

**23**  But I will put it into the [[#^note-23a|hand]] of them that [[#^note-23b|afflict]] thee; which have said to thy soul, [[#^note-23c|Bow down]], that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. ^verse-23
