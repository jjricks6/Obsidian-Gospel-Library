*Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gathering of Israel, and millennial judgment and peace—The proud and wicked will be brought low at the Second Coming—Compare 2 Nephi 12.*

**1**  The word that [[#^note-1a|Isaiah]] the son of Amoz [[#^note-1b|saw]] concerning Judah and Jerusalem. ^verse-1

**2**  And it shall come to pass in the [[#^note-2a|last days]], that the [[#^note-2b|mountain]] of the Lord's [[#^note-2c|house]] shall be [[#^note-2d|established]] in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all [[#^note-2e|nations]] shall flow unto it. ^verse-2

**3**  And many people shall [[#^note-3a|go]] and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the [[#^note-3b|mountain]] of the Lord, to the [[#^note-3c|house]] of the God of Jacob; and he will [[#^note-3d|teach]] us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of [[#^note-3e|Zion]] shall go forth the [[#^note-3f|law]], and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. ^verse-3

**4**  And he shall [[#^note-4a|judge]] among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn [[#^note-4b|war]] any more. ^verse-4

**5**  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us [[#^note-5a|walk]] in the [[#^note-5b|light]] of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, [[#^note-6a|be]]cause they be replenished from the east, and are [[#^note-6b|soothsayers]] like the Philistines, and they [[#^note-6c|please themselves in]] the children of strangers. ^verse-6

**7**  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: ^verse-7

**8**  Their land also is full of [[#^note-8a|idols]]; they [[#^note-8b|worship]] the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: ^verse-8

**9**  And the [[#^note-9a|mean man]] [[#^note-9b|boweth]] down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty. ^verse-10

**11**  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be [[#^note-11a|exalted]] in that [[#^note-11b|day]]. ^verse-11

**12**  For the [[#^note-12a|day]] of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is [[#^note-12b|proud]] and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought [[#^note-12c|low]]: ^verse-12

**13**  And upon all the [[#^note-13a|cedars]] of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, ^verse-13

**14**  And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, ^verse-14

**15**  And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|And]] upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. ^verse-16

**17**  And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the [[#^note-17a|haughtiness]] of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. ^verse-17

**18**  And the [[#^note-18a|idols]] he shall utterly abolish. ^verse-18

**19**  And they shall go into the [[#^note-19a|holes]] of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for [[#^note-19b|fear]] of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. ^verse-19

**20**  In that day a man shall [[#^note-20a|cast]] his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; ^verse-20

**21**  To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Cease]] ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for [[#^note-22b|wherein]] is he to be accounted of? ^verse-22
