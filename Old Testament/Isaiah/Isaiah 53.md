*Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—His humiliation and sufferings are described—He makes His soul an offering for sin and makes intercession for the transgressors—Compare Mosiah 14.*

**1**  Who hath [[#^note-1a|believed]] our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? ^verse-1

**2**  For he shall grow up before him as a tender [[#^note-2a|plant]], and as a [[#^note-2b|root]] out of a [[#^note-2c|dry]] ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no [[#^note-2d|beauty]] that we should desire him. ^verse-2

**3**  He is [[#^note-3a|despised]] and rejected of men; a man of [[#^note-3b|sorrows]], and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we [[#^note-3c|esteemed]] him not. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Surely he hath [[#^note-4a|borne]] our [[#^note-4b|griefs]], and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. ^verse-4

**5**  But he was [[#^note-5a|wounded]] for our [[#^note-5b|transgressions]], he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his [[#^note-5c|stripes]] we are [[#^note-5d|healed]]. ^verse-5

**6**  All we like [[#^note-6a|sheep]] have gone [[#^note-6b|astray]]; we have turned every one to his [[#^note-6c|own]] way; and the Lord hath laid on him the [[#^note-6d|iniquity]] of us all. ^verse-6

**7**  He was [[#^note-7a|oppressed]], and he was [[#^note-7b|afflicted]], yet he [[#^note-7c|opened]] not his mouth: he is brought as a [[#^note-7d|lamb]] to the [[#^note-7e|slaughter]], and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. ^verse-7

**8**  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his [[#^note-8a|generation]]? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the [[#^note-8b|transgression]] of my people was he stricken. ^verse-8

**9**  And he made his grave with the [[#^note-9a|wicked]], and with the rich in his [[#^note-9b|death]]; [[#^note-9c|because]] he had done no [[#^note-9d|violence]], neither was any [[#^note-9e|deceit]] in his mouth. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Yet it pleased the Lord to [[#^note-10a|bruise]] him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an [[#^note-10b|offering]] for sin, he shall see his [[#^note-10c|seed]], he shall prolong his days, and the [[#^note-10d|pleasure]] of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. ^verse-10

**11**  He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his [[#^note-11a|knowledge]] shall my righteous [[#^note-11b|servant]] [[#^note-11c|justify]] many; for he shall [[#^note-11d|bear]] their iniquities. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto [[#^note-12a|death]]: and he was numbered with the [[#^note-12b|transgressors]]; and he bare the sin of many, and made [[#^note-12c|intercession]] for the transgressors. ^verse-12
