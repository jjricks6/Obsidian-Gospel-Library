[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 64|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 66|Next Entry]]

*Ancient Israel was rejected for rejecting the Lord—The Lord's people will rejoice and triumph during the Millennium.*

**1**  I am [[#^note-1a|sought]] of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my [[#^note-1b|name]]. ^verse-1

**2**  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a [[#^note-2a|rebellious]] people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; ^verse-2

**3**  A people that provoketh me to [[#^note-3a|anger]] continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of [[#^note-3b|brick]]; ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Which remain]] among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; ^verse-4

**5**  Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am [[#^note-5a|holier]] than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will [[#^note-6a|recompense]], even recompense into their bosom, ^verse-6

**7**  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and [[#^note-7a|blasphemed]] me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, As the [[#^note-8a|new wine]] is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it [[#^note-8b|not]]; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all. ^verse-8

**9**  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of [[#^note-9a|Judah]] an inheritor of my mountains: and mine [[#^note-9b|elect]] shall [[#^note-9c|inherit]] it, and my servants shall dwell there. ^verse-9

**10**  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of [[#^note-10a|Achor]] a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that [[#^note-11a|troop]], and that furnish the drink offering unto that [[#^note-11b|number]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I [[#^note-12a|called]], ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall [[#^note-14a|howl]] for vexation of spirit. ^verse-14

**15**  And ye shall leave your name for a [[#^note-15a|curse]] unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another [[#^note-15b|name]]: ^verse-15

**16**  That he who [[#^note-16a|blesseth himself]] in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that [[#^note-16b|swear]]eth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ For, behold, I [[#^note-17a|create]] new [[#^note-17b|heavens]] and a [[#^note-17c|new]] [[#^note-17d|earth]]: and the [[#^note-17e|former]] shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. ^verse-17

**18**  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a [[#^note-18a|rejoicing]], and her people a joy. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will [[#^note-19a|rejoice]] in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. ^verse-19

**20**  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an [[#^note-20a|old]] man that hath not filled his days: for the [[#^note-20b|child]] shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed. ^verse-20

**21**  And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and [[#^note-21a|eat]] the fruit of them. ^verse-21

**22**  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a [[#^note-22a|tree]] are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. ^verse-22

**23**  They shall not [[#^note-23a|labour]] in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the [[#^note-23b|seed]] of the blessed of the Lord, and their [[#^note-23c|offspring]] with them. ^verse-23

**24**  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will [[#^note-24a|answer]]; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. ^verse-24

**25**  The [[#^note-25a|wolf]] and the lamb shall [[#^note-25b|feed]] together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not [[#^note-25c|hurt]] nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord. ^verse-25
