*In the last days, Zion and her stakes will be established, and Israel will be gathered in mercy and tenderness—Israel will triumph—Compare 3 Nephi 22.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Sing]], O [[#^note-1b|barren]], thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy [[#^note-2a|stakes]]; ^verse-2

**3**  For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. ^verse-3

**4**  Fear not; for thou shalt not be a[[#^note-4a|shame]]d: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the [[#^note-4b|reproach]] of thy widowhood any more. ^verse-4

**5**  For thy Maker is thine [[#^note-5a|husband]]; the [[#^note-5b|Lord of hosts]] is his name; and thy [[#^note-5c|Redeemer]] the Holy One of Israel; The [[#^note-5d|God]] of the whole earth shall he be called. ^verse-5

**6**  For the Lord hath called thee as a [[#^note-6a|woman]] [[#^note-6b|forsaken]] and grieved in spirit, and a [[#^note-6c|wife]] of youth, [[#^note-6d|when thou wast refused]], saith thy God. ^verse-6

**7**  For a small [[#^note-7a|moment]] have I [[#^note-7b|forsaken]] thee; but with great mercies will I [[#^note-7c|gather]] thee. ^verse-7

**8**  In a little [[#^note-8a|wrath]] I [[#^note-8b|hid]] my [[#^note-8c|face]] from thee for a moment; but with everlasting [[#^note-8d|kindness]] will I have [[#^note-8e|mercy]] on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. ^verse-8

**9**  For this is as the [[#^note-9a|waters of Noah]] unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. ^verse-9

**10**  For the [[#^note-10a|mountains]] shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the [[#^note-10b|covenant]] of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy [[#^note-11a|stones]] with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. ^verse-12

**13**  And all thy [[#^note-13a|children]] shall be [[#^note-13b|taught]] of the Lord; and great shall be the [[#^note-13c|peace]] of thy children. ^verse-13

**14**  In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the [[#^note-16a|waster]] to destroy. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ No [[#^note-17a|weapon]] that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every [[#^note-17b|tongue]] that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the [[#^note-17c|servants]] of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. ^verse-17
