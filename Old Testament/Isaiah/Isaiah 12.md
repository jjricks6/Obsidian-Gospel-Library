[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 13|Next Entry]]

*In the millennial day, all men will praise the Lord—He will dwell among them—Compare 2 Nephi 22.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] [[#^note-1b|in that day]] thou shalt say, [[#^note-1c|O]] Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord [[#^note-2a|Jehovah]] is my [[#^note-2b|strength]] and my song; he also is become my [[#^note-2c|salvation]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore with [[#^note-3a|joy]] shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. ^verse-3

**4**  And in that day shall ye say, [[#^note-4a|Praise]] the Lord, [[#^note-4b|call upon]] his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Sing]] unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. ^verse-5

**6**  Cry out and shout, thou [[#^note-6a|inhabitant]] of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the [[#^note-6b|midst]] of thee. ^verse-6
