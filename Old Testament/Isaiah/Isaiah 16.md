*Moab is condemned, and her people will sorrow—The Messiah will sit on David's throne, seeking justice and hastening righteousness.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Send]] ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. ^verse-1

**2**  For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of [[#^note-2a|Arnon]]. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Take counsel]], execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Let]] mine [[#^note-4b|outcasts]] dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. ^verse-4

**5**  And in [[#^note-5a|mercy]] shall the [[#^note-5b|throne]] be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and [[#^note-5c|hasting]] [[#^note-5d|righteousness]]. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ [[#^note-6a|We]] have heard of the [[#^note-6b|pride]] of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore shall Moab [[#^note-7a|howl]] for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of [[#^note-7b|Kir-hareseth]] shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken. ^verse-7

**8**  For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto [[#^note-8a|Jazer]], they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen. ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|gladness]] is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore my [[#^note-11a|bowels]] shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to [[#^note-12a|pray]]; but he shall not prevail. ^verse-12

**13**  This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning [[#^note-13a|Moab]] since that time. ^verse-13

**14**  But now the Lord hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble. ^verse-14
