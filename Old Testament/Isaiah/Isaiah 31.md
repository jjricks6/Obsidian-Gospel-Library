*Israel is reproved for turning to Egypt for help—When the Lord comes, He will defend and preserve His people.*

**1**  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for [[#^note-1a|help]]; and [[#^note-1b|stay]] on [[#^note-1c|horses]], and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord! ^verse-1

**2**  Yet he also is wise, and will bring [[#^note-2a|evil]], and will not [[#^note-2b|call]] back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. ^verse-2

**3**  Now the Egyptians are men, and not [[#^note-3a|God]]; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the Lord shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is [[#^note-3b|holpen]] shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. ^verse-3

**4**  For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me, Like as the [[#^note-4a|lion]] and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to [[#^note-4b|fight]] for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. ^verse-4

**5**  As birds [[#^note-5a|flying]], so will the Lord of hosts [[#^note-5b|defend]] Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. ^verse-6

**7**  For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Then shall the [[#^note-8a|Assyrian]] fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. ^verse-8

**9**  And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the [[#^note-9a|ensign]], saith the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. ^verse-9
