*Isaiah sees the Lord—His sins are forgiven—He is called to prophesy—He prophesies of the Jews' rejection of Christ's teachings—A remnant will return—Compare 2 Nephi 16.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|In]] the year that king Uzziah died I [[#^note-1b|saw]] also the [[#^note-1c|Lord]] sitting upon a [[#^note-1d|throne]], high and lifted up, and [[#^note-1e|his train]] filled the temple. ^verse-1

**2**  Above it stood the [[#^note-2a|seraphims]]: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. ^verse-2

**3**  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the [[#^note-3a|Lord of hosts]]: the whole earth is full of his [[#^note-3b|glory]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And the [[#^note-4a|posts]] of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with [[#^note-4b|smoke]]. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Then said I, Woe is me! for I am [[#^note-5a|undone]]; because I am a man of [[#^note-5b|unclean]] lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have [[#^note-5c|seen]] the [[#^note-5d|King]], the Lord of hosts. ^verse-5

**6**  Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live [[#^note-6a|coal]] in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: ^verse-6

**7**  And he laid it upon my [[#^note-7a|mouth]], and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is [[#^note-7b|taken]] away, and thy sin purged. ^verse-7

**8**  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I [[#^note-8a|send]], and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; [[#^note-8b|send]] me. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And he said, Go, and tell this people, [[#^note-9a|Hear]] ye indeed, but [[#^note-9b|understand]] not; and see ye indeed, but [[#^note-9c|perceive]] not. ^verse-9

**10**  Make the [[#^note-10a|heart]] of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and [[#^note-10b|shut]] their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. ^verse-10

**11**  Then said I, Lord, [[#^note-11a|how]] long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, ^verse-11

**12**  And the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ But yet in [[#^note-13a|it]] shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose [[#^note-13b|substance]] is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. ^verse-13
