[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 9|Next Entry]]

*Christ will be as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, not muttering wizards—Turn to the law and to the testimony for guidance—Compare 2 Nephi 18.*

**1**  Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great [[#^note-1a|roll]], and [[#^note-1b|write]] in it with [[#^note-1c|a man's pen]] concerning [[#^note-1d|Maher-shalal-hash-baz]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. ^verse-2

**3**  And I went unto [[#^note-3a|the prophetess]]; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name [[#^note-3b|Maher-shalal-hash-baz]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For [[#^note-4a|before]] the child shall [[#^note-4b|have]] knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of [[#^note-4c|Samaria]] shall be [[#^note-4d|taken]] away before the king of Assyria. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ The Lord spake also unto me again, saying, ^verse-5

**6**  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of [[#^note-6a|Shiloah]] that go softly, and rejoice in [[#^note-6b|Rezin]] and Remaliah's son; ^verse-6

**7**  Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon [[#^note-7a|them]] the [[#^note-7b|waters]] of the river, strong and many, even the king of [[#^note-7c|Assyria]], and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: ^verse-7

**8**  And he shall [[#^note-8a|pass through Judah]]; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the [[#^note-8b|neck]]; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O [[#^note-8c|Immanuel]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ [[#^note-9a|Associate yourselves]], O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. ^verse-9

**10**  Take [[#^note-10a|counsel]] together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for [[#^note-10b|God]] is with us. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ For the Lord spake thus to me [[#^note-11a|with a strong hand]], and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, ^verse-11

**12**  Say ye not, A [[#^note-12a|confederacy]], to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. ^verse-12

**13**  Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and [[#^note-13a|let]] him be your fear, and let him be your dread. ^verse-13

**14**  And he shall be for a [[#^note-14a|sanctuary]]; but for a [[#^note-14b|stone]] of [[#^note-14c|stumbling]] and for a [[#^note-14d|rock]] of [[#^note-14e|offence]] to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a [[#^note-14f|snare]] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ^verse-14

**15**  And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Bind]] up the testimony, [[#^note-16b|seal]] the [[#^note-16c|law]] among my disciples. ^verse-16

**17**  And I will wait upon the Lord, that [[#^note-17a|hideth]] his [[#^note-17b|face]] from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for [[#^note-18a|signs]] and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have [[#^note-19a|familiar spirits]], and unto [[#^note-19b|wizards]] that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? [[#^note-19c|for]] the living to the dead? ^verse-19

**20**  To the [[#^note-20a|law]] and to the testimony: if [[#^note-20b|they]] speak not according to this word, it is because there is no [[#^note-20c|light]] in them. ^verse-20

**21**  And [[#^note-21a|they]] shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and [[#^note-21b|curse]] their king and their God, and look upward. ^verse-21

**22**  And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and [[#^note-22a|darkness]], [[#^note-22b|dimness of anguish]]; and they shall be driven to darkness. ^verse-22
