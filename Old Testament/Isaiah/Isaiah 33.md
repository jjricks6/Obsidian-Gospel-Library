### Chapter 33

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 32|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 34|Next Entry]]

*Apostasy and wickedness will precede the Second Coming—The Lord will come with devouring fire—Zion and its stakes will be perfected—The Lord is our Judge, Lawgiver, and King.*

**1**  Woe to thee that [[#^note-1a|spoilest]], and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest [[#^note-1b|treacherously]], and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. ^verse-1

**2**  O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have [[#^note-2a|waited]] for thee: be thou their [[#^note-2b|arm]] every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. ^verse-2

**3**  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered. ^verse-3

**4**  And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. ^verse-5

**6**  And wisdom and [[#^note-6a|knowledge]] shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his [[#^note-6b|treasure]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. ^verse-7

**8**  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath [[#^note-8a|broken the covenant]], he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. ^verse-8

**9**  The earth [[#^note-9a|mourneth]] and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits. ^verse-9

**10**  Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself. ^verse-10

**11**  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you. ^verse-11

**12**  And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. ^verse-13

**14**  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with [[#^note-14a|everlasting]] [[#^note-14b|burnings]]? ^verse-14

**15**  He that [[#^note-15a|walketh]] righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth [[#^note-15b|the gain of oppressions]], that shaketh his hands from holding of [[#^note-15c|bribes]], that stoppeth his ears from hearing of [[#^note-15d|blood]], and shutteth his eyes [[#^note-15e|from seeing evil]]; ^verse-15

**16**  He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. ^verse-16

**17**  Thine eyes shall see the king in his [[#^note-17a|beauty]]: they shall behold the land that is very far off. ^verse-17

**18**  Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the [[#^note-18a|scribe]]? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers? ^verse-18

**19**  Thou shalt not see [[#^note-19a|a fierce people]], a people of a deeper [[#^note-19b|speech]] than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand. ^verse-19

**20**  Look upon [[#^note-20a|Zion]], the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the [[#^note-20b|stakes]] thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. ^verse-20

**21**  But there the glorious Lord will be [[#^note-21a|unto us a place]] of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. ^verse-21

**22**  For the Lord is our [[#^note-22a|judge]], the Lord is our [[#^note-22b|lawgiver]], the Lord is our king; he will save us. ^verse-22

**23**  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. ^verse-23

**24**  And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. ^verse-24
