[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 54|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 56|Next Entry]]

*Come and drink; salvation is free—The Lord will make an everlasting covenant with Israel—Seek the Lord while He is near.*

**1**  Ho, every one that [[#^note-1a|thirsteth]], come ye to the [[#^note-1b|waters]], and he that hath no money; come ye, [[#^note-1c|buy]], and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without [[#^note-1d|price]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore do ye [[#^note-2a|spend]] money for that which is not bread? and your [[#^note-2b|labour]] for that which satisfieth not? hearken [[#^note-2c|diligently]] unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. ^verse-2

**3**  Incline your ear, and [[#^note-3a|come]] unto me: hear, and your [[#^note-3b|soul]] shall live; and I will make an everlasting [[#^note-3c|covenant]] with you, even the [[#^note-3d|sure]] mercies of David. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I have given him for a [[#^note-4a|witness]] to the people, a [[#^note-4b|leader]] and commander to the people. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and [[#^note-5a|nations]] that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ [[#^note-6a|Seek]] ye the [[#^note-6b|Lord]] while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: ^verse-6

**7**  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him [[#^note-7a|return]] unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly [[#^note-7b|pardon]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ For my [[#^note-8a|thoughts]] are not [[#^note-8b|your]] thoughts, neither are your [[#^note-8c|ways]] my [[#^note-8d|ways]], saith the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my [[#^note-9a|ways]] [[#^note-9b|higher]] than your ways, and my [[#^note-9c|thoughts]] than your thoughts. ^verse-9

**10**  For as the [[#^note-10a|rain]] cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and [[#^note-10b|bread]] to the eater: ^verse-10

**11**  So shall my [[#^note-11a|word]] be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. ^verse-11

**12**  For ye shall go out with [[#^note-12a|joy]], and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the [[#^note-12b|trees]] of the field shall clap their hands. ^verse-12

**13**  Instead of the thorn shall come up the [[#^note-13a|fir tree]], and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. ^verse-13
