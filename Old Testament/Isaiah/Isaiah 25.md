[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 24|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 26|Next Entry]]

*In Mount Zion the Lord will prepare a gospel feast of rich food—He will swallow up death in victory—It will be said, Lo, this is our God.*

**1**  O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. ^verse-1

**2**  For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast been a strength to the [[#^note-4a|poor]], a strength to the needy in his [[#^note-4b|distress]], a [[#^note-4c|refuge]] from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the [[#^note-5a|branch]] of the terrible ones shall be brought low. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all [[#^note-6a|people]] a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. ^verse-6

**7**  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the [[#^note-7a|veil]] that is spread over all nations. ^verse-7

**8**  He will swallow up [[#^note-8a|death]] in [[#^note-8b|victory]]; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the [[#^note-8c|rebuke of his people]] shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our [[#^note-9a|God]]; we have [[#^note-9b|waited]] for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his [[#^note-9c|salvation]]. ^verse-9

**10**    For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. ^verse-10

**11**  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. ^verse-11

**12**  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the [[#^note-12a|dust]]. ^verse-12
