[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 4|Next Entry]]

*Judah and Jerusalem will be punished for their disobedience—The Lord pleads for and judges His people—The daughters of Zion are cursed and tormented for their worldliness—Compare 2 Nephi 13.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|For]], behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from [[#^note-1b|Jerusalem]] and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of [[#^note-1c|bread]], and the whole stay of water, ^verse-1

**2**  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the [[#^note-2a|ancient]], ^verse-2

**3**  The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and [[#^note-3a|the cunning artificer]], and the [[#^note-3b|eloquent orator]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And I will give [[#^note-4a|children]] to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. ^verse-4

**5**  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the [[#^note-5a|ancient]], and the base against the honourable. ^verse-5

**6**  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this [[#^note-6a|ruin]] be under thy hand: ^verse-6

**7**  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be [[#^note-7a|an healer]]; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. ^verse-7

**8**  For [[#^note-8a|Jerusalem]] is ruined, and Judah is [[#^note-8b|fallen]]: because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their [[#^note-9a|sin]] as [[#^note-9b|Sodom]], they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. ^verse-9

**10**  Say ye to the [[#^note-10a|righteous]], that it shall be well with him: for they shall [[#^note-10b|eat]] the fruit of their doings. ^verse-10

**11**  Woe unto the [[#^note-11a|wicked]]! it shall be ill with him: for [[#^note-11b|the]] reward of his hands shall be given him. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ As for my people, children are their oppressors, and [[#^note-12a|women]] rule over them. O my people, they which [[#^note-12b|lead]] thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. ^verse-12

**13**  The Lord standeth up to [[#^note-13a|plead]], and standeth to judge the people. ^verse-13

**14**  The Lord will enter into [[#^note-14a|judgment]] with the [[#^note-14b|ancients]] of his people, and the [[#^note-14c|princes]] thereof: for ye have [[#^note-14d|eaten up]] the vineyard; the [[#^note-14e|spoil]] of the [[#^note-14f|poor]] is in your houses. ^verse-14

**15**  What mean ye that ye [[#^note-15a|beat]] my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Moreover the Lord saith, Because the [[#^note-16a|daughters]] of Zion are [[#^note-16b|haughty]], and [[#^note-16c|walk]] with stretched forth necks and [[#^note-16d|wanton]] eyes, walking and [[#^note-16e|mincing]] as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will [[#^note-17a|discover their secret parts]]. ^verse-17

**18**  In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their [[#^note-18a|cauls]], and their [[#^note-18b|round]] tires like the moon, ^verse-18

**19**  The chains, and the bracelets, and the [[#^note-19a|mufflers]], ^verse-19

**20**  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, ^verse-20

**21**  The rings, and nose jewels, ^verse-21

**22**  The [[#^note-22a|changeable suits]] of [[#^note-22b|apparel]], and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, ^verse-22

**23**  The [[#^note-23a|glasses]], and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils. ^verse-23

**24**  And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle [[#^note-24a|a rent]]; and instead of well set hair [[#^note-24b|baldness]]; and instead of [[#^note-24c|a stomacher]] a girding of sackcloth; and [[#^note-24d|burning]] instead of [[#^note-24e|beauty]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Thy [[#^note-25a|men]] shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. ^verse-25

**26**  And her [[#^note-26a|gates]] shall [[#^note-26b|lament]] and [[#^note-26c|mourn]]; and she being [[#^note-26d|desolate]] shall sit upon the [[#^note-26e|ground]]. ^verse-26
