### Chapter 63

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 62|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 64|Next Entry]]

*The Second Coming will be a day of vengeance and also the year of the redeemed of the Lord—Then the Saints will praise the Lord and acknowledge Him as their father.*

**1**  Who is this that [[#^note-1a|cometh]] from [[#^note-1b|Edom]], with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore art thou [[#^note-2a|red]] in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the [[#^note-2b|winefat]]? ^verse-2

**3**  I have trodden the [[#^note-3a|winepress]] alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be [[#^note-3b|sprinkled]] upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. ^verse-3

**4**  For the day of [[#^note-4a|vengeance]] is in mine heart, and the year of my [[#^note-4b|redeemed]] is come. ^verse-4

**5**  And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought [[#^note-5a|salvation]] unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. ^verse-5

**6**  And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and [[#^note-6a|make them drunk]] in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ I will mention the [[#^note-7a|lovingkindnesses]] of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the great [[#^note-7b|goodness]] toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. ^verse-7

**8**  For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their [[#^note-8a|Saviour]]. ^verse-8

**9**  In all their [[#^note-9a|affliction]] he was afflicted, and the [[#^note-9b|angel]] of his [[#^note-9c|presence]] saved them: in his [[#^note-9d|love]] and in his pity he [[#^note-9e|redeemed]] them; and he bare them, and [[#^note-9f|carried]] them all the days of old. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ But they [[#^note-10a|rebelled]], and [[#^note-10b|vexed]] his [[#^note-10c|holy Spirit]]: therefore he was turned to be their [[#^note-10d|enemy]], and he fought against them. ^verse-10

**11**  Then [[#^note-11a|he remembered]] the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the [[#^note-11b|sea]] with the [[#^note-11c|shepherd]] of his [[#^note-11d|flock]]? where is he that put his holy Spirit within [[#^note-11e|him]]? ^verse-11

**12**  That led them by the right hand of [[#^note-12a|Moses]] with his glorious arm, [[#^note-12b|dividing]] the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? ^verse-12

**13**  That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|As a beast goeth]] down into the valley, the [[#^note-14b|Spirit]] of the Lord caused [[#^note-14c|him]] to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious [[#^note-14d|name]]. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ [[#^note-15a|Look]] down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy [[#^note-15b|holiness]] and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, [[#^note-15c|the]] sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? ^verse-15

**16**  Doubtless thou art our [[#^note-16a|father]], though Abraham [[#^note-16b|be ignorant]] of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from [[#^note-16c|everlasting]]. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ O Lord, why hast thou [[#^note-17a|made]] us to err from thy ways, and [[#^note-17b|hardened]] our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. ^verse-17

**18**  The [[#^note-18a|people]] of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have [[#^note-18b|trodden]] down thy sanctuary. ^verse-18

**19**  We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy [[#^note-19a|name]]. ^verse-19
