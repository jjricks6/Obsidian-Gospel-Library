*The stem of Jesse (Christ) will judge in righteousness—The knowledge about God will cover the earth in the Millennium—The Lord will raise an ensign and gather Israel—Compare 2 Nephi 21.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] there shall come forth a [[#^note-1b|rod]] out of the [[#^note-1c|stem]] of [[#^note-1d|Jesse]], and a [[#^note-1e|Branch]] shall grow out of his roots: ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|spirit]] of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of [[#^note-2b|wisdom]] and [[#^note-2c|understanding]], the spirit of [[#^note-2d|counsel]] and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; ^verse-2

**3**  And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not [[#^note-3a|judge]] [[#^note-3b|after]] the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: ^verse-3

**4**  But with righteousness shall [[#^note-4a|he]] [[#^note-4b|judge]] the poor, and [[#^note-4c|reprove with equity]] for the [[#^note-4d|meek]] of the earth: and he shall [[#^note-4e|smite]] the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the [[#^note-4f|breath]] of his lips shall he [[#^note-4g|slay]] the wicked. ^verse-4

**5**  And righteousness shall be the [[#^note-5a|girdle]] of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his [[#^note-5b|reins]]. ^verse-5

**6**  The [[#^note-6a|wolf]] also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. ^verse-6

**7**  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. ^verse-7

**8**  And the sucking child shall play on the hole of [[#^note-8a|the asp]], and the weaned child shall put his hand on the [[#^note-8b|cockatrice']] den. ^verse-8

**9**  They shall not [[#^note-9a|hurt]] nor [[#^note-9b|destroy]] in all my holy [[#^note-9c|mountain]]: for the [[#^note-9d|earth]] shall be full of the [[#^note-9e|knowledge]] of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And in [[#^note-10a|that day]] there shall be a [[#^note-10b|root of Jesse]], which shall stand for an [[#^note-10c|ensign]] of the people; [[#^note-10d|to it]] shall the [[#^note-10e|Gentiles]] seek: and his [[#^note-10f|rest]] shall be glorious. ^verse-10

**11**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the [[#^note-11a|second]] time to [[#^note-11b|recover]] the [[#^note-11c|remnant]] of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the [[#^note-11d|islands]] of the sea. ^verse-11

**12**  And he shall set up an [[#^note-12a|ensign]] for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|envy]] also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of [[#^note-13b|Judah]] shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. ^verse-13

**14**  But they shall [[#^note-14a|fly]] upon the [[#^note-14b|shoulders]] of the Philistines toward the west; [[#^note-14c|they shall spoil]] them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord shall utterly [[#^note-15a|destroy]] the tongue of the [[#^note-15b|Egyptian]] sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. ^verse-15

**16**  And there shall be [[#^note-16a|an]] [[#^note-16b|highway]] for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-16
