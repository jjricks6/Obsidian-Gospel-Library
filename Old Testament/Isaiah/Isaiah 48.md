*The Lord reveals His purposes to Israel—Israel has been chosen in the furnace of affliction and is to depart from Babylon—Compare 1 Nephi 20.*

**1**  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the [[#^note-1a|waters of Judah]], which [[#^note-1b|swear]] by the name of the Lord, and make [[#^note-1c|mention]] of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. ^verse-1

**2**  For they call themselves of the [[#^note-2a|holy city]], and [[#^note-2b|stay themselves upon]] the God of Israel; The Lord of hosts is his name. ^verse-2

**3**  I have [[#^note-3a|declared]] the [[#^note-3b|former]] things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass. ^verse-3

**4**  Because I knew that [[#^note-4a|thou]] art [[#^note-4b|obstinate]], and thy [[#^note-4c|neck]] is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; ^verse-4

**5**  I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. ^verse-6

**7**  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the [[#^note-8a|womb]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ For my [[#^note-9a|name's]] sake will I defer mine [[#^note-9b|anger]], and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the [[#^note-10a|furnace]] of [[#^note-10b|affliction]]. ^verse-10

**11**  For mine own [[#^note-11a|sake]], even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my [[#^note-11b|name]] be polluted? and I will not [[#^note-11c|give]] my glory unto another. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. ^verse-12

**13**  Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the [[#^note-13a|earth]], and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together. ^verse-13

**14**  All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The Lord hath loved him: he will do his [[#^note-14a|pleasure]] on [[#^note-14b|Babylon]], and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. ^verse-14

**15**  I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in [[#^note-16a|secret]] from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath [[#^note-16b|sent]] me. ^verse-16

**17**  Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which [[#^note-17a|leadeth]] thee by the way that thou shouldest go. ^verse-17

**18**  O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy [[#^note-18a|peace]] been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: ^verse-18

**19**  Thy [[#^note-19a|seed]] also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Go ye forth of [[#^note-20a|Babylon]], flee ye from the [[#^note-20b|Chaldeans]], with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob. ^verse-20

**21**  And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the [[#^note-21a|waters]] to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. ^verse-21

**22**  There is no [[#^note-22a|peace]], saith the Lord, unto the wicked. ^verse-22
