*Hezekiah's life is lengthened fifteen years—The sun goes back ten degrees as a sign—Hezekiah praises and thanks the Lord.*

**1**  In those days was [[#^note-1a|Hezekiah]] sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. ^verse-1

**2**  Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, ^verse-2

**3**  And said, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying, ^verse-4

**5**  Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will [[#^note-5a|add]] unto thy days fifteen years. ^verse-5

**6**  And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will [[#^note-6a|defend]] this city. ^verse-6

**7**  And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken; ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, I will bring again the [[#^note-8a|shadow]] of the degrees, which is gone down in the [[#^note-8b|sun]] dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ The [[#^note-9a|writing]] of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness: ^verse-9

**10**  I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. ^verse-10

**11**  I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. ^verse-11

**12**  Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have [[#^note-12a|cut off]] like a weaver my life: he will cut me off [[#^note-12b|with pining sickness]]: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. ^verse-12

**13**  I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. ^verse-13

**14**  Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppressed; [[#^note-14a|undertake for me]]. ^verse-14

**15**  What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the [[#^note-15a|bitterness]] of my soul. ^verse-15

**16**  O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: [[#^note-16a|so]] wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, [[#^note-17a|for]] peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul [[#^note-17b|delivered]] it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. ^verse-17

**18**  For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. ^verse-18

**19**  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the [[#^note-19a|father]] to the children shall make known thy [[#^note-19b|truth]]. ^verse-19

**20**  The Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and [[#^note-21a|lay it]] for a plaster upon the [[#^note-21b|boil]], and he shall recover. ^verse-21

**22**  Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord? ^verse-22
