*The Lord will smite and destroy Egypt—Finally He will heal her, and Egypt and Assyria will be blessed with Israel.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|burden]] of [[#^note-1b|Egypt]]. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift [[#^note-1c|cloud]], and shall come into Egypt: and the [[#^note-1d|idols]] of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. ^verse-1

**2**  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. ^verse-2

**3**  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to [[#^note-3a|them]] that have [[#^note-3b|familiar spirits]], and to the wizards. ^verse-3

**4**  And the Egypti[[#^note-4a|a]]ns will I give over into the hand of a [[#^note-4b|cruel]] lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts. ^verse-4

**5**  And the waters shall [[#^note-5a|fail]] from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and [[#^note-5b|dried]] up. ^verse-5

**6**  And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither. ^verse-6

**7**  The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more. ^verse-7

**8**  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast [[#^note-8a|angle]] into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. ^verse-8

**9**  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave [[#^note-9a|networks]], shall be confounded. ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|they shall be broken]] in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Surely the princes of [[#^note-11a|Zoan]] are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? ^verse-11

**12**  Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt. ^verse-12

**13**  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of [[#^note-13a|Noph]] are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the [[#^note-13b|stay]] of the tribes thereof. ^verse-13

**14**  The Lord hath mingled a [[#^note-14a|perverse]] spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. ^verse-14

**15**  Nei[[#^note-15a|the]]r shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do. ^verse-15

**16**  In that day shall [[#^note-16a|Egypt]] be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shaketh over it. ^verse-16

**17**  And the land of [[#^note-17a|Judah]] shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath determined against it. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called, The city of [[#^note-18a|destruction]]. ^verse-18

**19**  In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. ^verse-19

**20**  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them. ^verse-20

**21**  And the Lord shall be known to [[#^note-21a|Egypt]], and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall [[#^note-21b|vow]] a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. ^verse-21

**22**  And the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall [[#^note-22a|return]] even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ In that day shall there be a [[#^note-23a|highway]] out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. ^verse-23

**24**  In that day shall [[#^note-24a|Israel]] be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a [[#^note-24b|blessing]] in the midst of the land: ^verse-24

**25**  Whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and [[#^note-25a|Israel]] mine [[#^note-25b|inheritance]]. ^verse-25
