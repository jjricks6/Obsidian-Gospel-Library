*The destruction of Babylon is a type of the destruction at the Second Coming—It will be a day of wrath and vengeance—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—Compare 2 Nephi 23.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|The]] [[#^note-1b|burden]] of [[#^note-1c|Babylon]], which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. ^verse-1

**2**  Lift ye up a [[#^note-2a|banner]] upon the high [[#^note-2b|mountain]], [[#^note-2c|exalt]] the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. ^verse-2

**3**  I have commanded my [[#^note-3a|sanctified ones]], I have also called my [[#^note-3b|mighty]] ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. ^verse-3

**4**  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the [[#^note-4a|kingdoms]] of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the [[#^note-4b|battle]]. ^verse-4

**5**  They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to [[#^note-5a|destroy]] the whole land. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ [[#^note-6a|Howl]] ye; for the [[#^note-6b|day]] of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall [[#^note-7a|melt]]: ^verse-7

**8**  And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in [[#^note-8a|pain]] as a woman that [[#^note-8b|travaileth]]: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall [[#^note-9a|destroy]] the sinners thereof out of it. ^verse-9

**10**  For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be [[#^note-10a|darkened]] in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will [[#^note-11a|punish]] the [[#^note-11b|world]] for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the [[#^note-11c|haughtiness]] of the [[#^note-11d|terrible]]. ^verse-11

**12**  I will make a man more [[#^note-12a|precious]] than fine gold; even a man than the [[#^note-12b|golden]] wedge of Ophir. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore I will [[#^note-13a|shake]] the heavens, and the [[#^note-13b|earth]] shall [[#^note-13c|remove]] out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce [[#^note-13d|anger]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And it shall be as the [[#^note-14a|chased roe]], and as a sheep that [[#^note-14b|no man taketh up]]: they shall every man turn to his own [[#^note-14c|people]], and flee every one into his own [[#^note-14d|land]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Every one that is found shall be [[#^note-15a|thrust]] through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. ^verse-15

**16**  Their [[#^note-16a|children]] also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their [[#^note-16b|houses]] shall be [[#^note-16c|spoiled]], and their wives ravished. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, I will stir up the [[#^note-17a|Medes]] against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. ^verse-17

**18**  Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And [[#^note-19a|Babylon]], the glory of kingdoms, the [[#^note-19b|beauty]] of the [[#^note-19c|Chaldees']] excellency, shall be as when God [[#^note-19d|overthrew]] [[#^note-19e|Sodom]] and Gomorrah. ^verse-19

**20**  It shall never be [[#^note-20a|inhabited]], neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. ^verse-20

**21**  But [[#^note-21a|wild]] beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and [[#^note-21b|satyrs]] shall dance there. ^verse-21

**22**  And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate [[#^note-22a|houses]], and [[#^note-22b|dragons]] in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged. ^verse-22
