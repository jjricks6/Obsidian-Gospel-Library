*Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—The people in darkness will see a great Light—Unto us a Child is born—He will be the Prince of Peace and reign on David's throne—Compare 2 Nephi 19.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Nevertheless]] the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, [[#^note-1b|when]] at the first he lightly afflicted the land of [[#^note-1c|Zebulun]] and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. ^verse-1

**2**  The people that walked in [[#^note-2a|darkness]] have seen a great [[#^note-2b|light]]: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou hast [[#^note-3a|multiplied]] the [[#^note-3b|nation]], [[#^note-3c|and]] not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men [[#^note-3d|rejoice]] when they divide the spoil. ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast broken the [[#^note-4a|yoke]] of his [[#^note-4b|burden]], and the staff of his shoulder, the [[#^note-4c|rod]] of his oppressor, as [[#^note-4d|in]] the day of [[#^note-4e|Midian]]. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|For]] every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with [[#^note-5b|burning]] and fuel of fire. ^verse-5

**6**    For unto us a [[#^note-6a|child]] is [[#^note-6b|born]], unto us a [[#^note-6c|son]] is given: and the [[#^note-6d|government]] shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, [[#^note-6e|Counsellor]], The [[#^note-6f|mighty]] [[#^note-6g|God]], The [[#^note-6h|everlasting]] Father, The Prince of [[#^note-6i|Peace]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Of the increase of his [[#^note-7a|government]] and peace there shall be no [[#^note-7b|end]], upon the throne of [[#^note-7c|David]], and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with [[#^note-7d|justice]] from henceforth even for ever. The [[#^note-7e|zeal]] of the Lord of hosts will perform this. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon [[#^note-8a|Israel]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the [[#^note-9a|pride]] and stoutness of heart, ^verse-9

**10**  The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of [[#^note-11a|Rezin]] against him, and join his enemies together; ^verse-11

**12**  The Syrians [[#^note-12a|before]], and the Philistines [[#^note-12b|behind]]; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his [[#^note-12c|anger]] is not turned away, but [[#^note-12d|his]] hand is [[#^note-12e|stretched]] out still. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ For the people [[#^note-13a|turneth not]] unto him that smiteth them, neither do they [[#^note-13b|seek]] the Lord of hosts. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|ancient and honourable]], he is the head; and the [[#^note-15b|prophet]] that teacheth lies, he is the tail. ^verse-15

**16**  For the [[#^note-16a|leaders]] of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are [[#^note-16b|destroyed]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an [[#^note-17a|hypocrite]] and an evildoer, and every mouth [[#^note-17b|speaketh]] folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and [[#^note-18a|thorns]], and shall kindle in the [[#^note-18b|thickets]] of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. ^verse-18

**19**  Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall [[#^note-19a|spare]] his [[#^note-19b|brother]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall [[#^note-20a|eat]] on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the [[#^note-20b|flesh]] of his own arm: ^verse-20

**21**  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. ^verse-21
