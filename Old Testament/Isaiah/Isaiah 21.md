[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 22|Next Entry]]

*Babylon is fallen, is fallen!—Other nations also are destroyed.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|burden]] of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in [[#^note-1b|the south]] pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land. ^verse-1

**2**  A grievous vision is declared unto me; the [[#^note-2a|treacherous]] dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O [[#^note-2b|Elam]]: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was [[#^note-3a|dismayed]] at the seeing of it. ^verse-3

**4**  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. ^verse-4

**5**  Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield. ^verse-5

**6**  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him [[#^note-6a|declare]] what he seeth. ^verse-6

**7**  And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed: ^verse-7

**8**  And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: ^verse-8

**9**  And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, [[#^note-9a|Babylon]] is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|O]] my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ The [[#^note-11a|burden of Dumah]]. He calleth to me out of [[#^note-11b|Seir]], Watchman, [[#^note-11c|what of the night]]? Watchman, what of the night? ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|The]] watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ The [[#^note-13a|burden]] upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. ^verse-13

**14**  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. ^verse-14

**15**  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. ^verse-15

**16**  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of [[#^note-16a|Kedar]] shall fail: ^verse-16

**17**  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it. ^verse-17
