*Ephraim and Syria wage war against Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—Compare 2 Nephi 17.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that [[#^note-1b|Rezin]] the [[#^note-1c|king]] of Syria, and [[#^note-1d|Pekah]] the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. ^verse-1

**2**  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with [[#^note-2a|Ephraim]]. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. ^verse-2

**3**  Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and [[#^note-3a|Shear-jashub]] thy son, at the end of the [[#^note-3b|conduit]] of the upper pool [[#^note-3c|in]] the highway of the fuller's field; ^verse-3

**4**  And say unto him, [[#^note-4a|Take heed]], and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. ^verse-4

**5**  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, ^verse-5

**6**  Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us [[#^note-6a|make a breach]] therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: ^verse-6

**7**  Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. ^verse-7

**8**  For the head of Syria is [[#^note-8a|Damascus]], and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall [[#^note-8b|Ephraim]] be broken, that it be not a people. ^verse-8

**9**  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. [[#^note-9a|If]] ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, ^verse-10

**11**  Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. ^verse-11

**12**  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I [[#^note-12a|tempt]] the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? ^verse-13

**14**    Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a [[#^note-14a|sign]]; [[#^note-14b|Behold]], a [[#^note-14c|virgin]] shall conceive, and bear a [[#^note-14d|son]], and shall call his name [[#^note-14e|Immanuel]]. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Butter and honey]] shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. ^verse-15

**16**  For [[#^note-16a|before]] the child shall know to refuse the [[#^note-16b|evil]], and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ [[#^note-17a|The]] Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that [[#^note-17b|Ephraim]] departed from [[#^note-17c|Judah]]; even the king of Assyria. ^verse-17

**18**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall [[#^note-18a|hiss]] [[#^note-18b|for the fly]] that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. ^verse-18

**19**  And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. ^verse-19

**20**  In the same day shall the Lord [[#^note-20a|shave]] with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. ^verse-20

**21**  And it sh[[#^note-21a|a]]ll come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; ^verse-21

**22**  And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for [[#^note-22a|butter and honey]] shall every one eat that is left in the land. ^verse-22

**23**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand [[#^note-23a|silverlings]], it shall even be for briers and thorns. ^verse-23

**24**  With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. ^verse-24

**25**  And on all hills that shall be [[#^note-25a|digged with the mattock]], there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of [[#^note-25b|lesser cattle]]. ^verse-25
