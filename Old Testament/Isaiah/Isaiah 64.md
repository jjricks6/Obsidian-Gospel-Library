*The people of the Lord pray for the Second Coming and for the salvation that will then be theirs.*

**1**  Oh that thou wouldest [[#^note-1a|rend]] the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the [[#^note-1b|mountains]] might flow down at thy [[#^note-1c|presence]], ^verse-1

**2**  As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may [[#^note-2a|tremble]] at thy presence! ^verse-2

**3**  When thou didst [[#^note-3a|terrible]] things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the [[#^note-3b|mountains]] flowed down at thy presence. ^verse-3

**4**  For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the [[#^note-4a|eye]] seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath [[#^note-4b|prepared]] for him that waiteth for him. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. ^verse-5

**6**  But we are all as an [[#^note-6a|unclean thing]], and all our righteousnesses are as [[#^note-6b|filthy]] rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. ^verse-6

**7**  And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy [[#^note-7a|face]] from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. ^verse-7

**8**  But now, O Lord, thou art our [[#^note-8a|father]]; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the [[#^note-8b|work]] of thy hand. ^verse-8

**9**  Â¶ Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy [[#^note-9a|people]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. ^verse-10

**11**  Our holy and our [[#^note-11a|beautiful]] house, where our fathers praised thee, is [[#^note-11b|burned]] up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid [[#^note-11c|waste]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Wilt thou [[#^note-12a|refrain]] thyself for these things, O Lord? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore? ^verse-12
