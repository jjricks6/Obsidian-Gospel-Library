*Zion and her daughters will be redeemed and cleansed in the millennial dayâ€”Compare 2 Nephi 14.*

**1**  And in that day [[#^note-1a|seven]] women shall take hold of one [[#^note-1b|man]], saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy [[#^note-1c|name]], to take away our [[#^note-1d|reproach]]. ^verse-1

**2**  In that day shall the [[#^note-2a|branch]] of the Lord be [[#^note-2b|beautiful]] and glorious, and the [[#^note-2c|fruit]] of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are [[#^note-2d|escaped]] of Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall come to pass, that he that is [[#^note-3a|left]] in [[#^note-3b|Zion]], and he that remaineth in [[#^note-3c|Jerusalem]], shall be called holy, even every one that is [[#^note-3d|written among the living]] in Jerusalem: ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|When]] the Lord shall have [[#^note-4b|washed]] away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have [[#^note-4c|purged]] the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of [[#^note-4d|burning]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount [[#^note-5a|Zion]], and upon her assemblies, a [[#^note-5b|cloud]] and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming [[#^note-5c|fire]] by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence. ^verse-5

**6**  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of [[#^note-6a|refuge]], and for a covert from storm and from rain. ^verse-6
