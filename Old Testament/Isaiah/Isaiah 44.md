### Chapter 44

[[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 43|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Isaiah/Isaiah 45|Next Entry]]

*The Lord's Spirit will be poured out on the descendants of Israel—Idols of wood are as fuel for a fire—The Lord will gather, bless, and redeem Israel and rebuild Jerusalem.*

**1**  Yet now hear, O Jacob my [[#^note-1a|servant]]; and Israel, whom I have chosen: ^verse-1

**2**  Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and [[#^note-2a|formed]] thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, [[#^note-2b|Jesurun]], whom I have chosen. ^verse-2

**3**  For I will pour water upon [[#^note-3a|him]] that is [[#^note-3b|thirsty]], and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my [[#^note-3c|spirit]] upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses. ^verse-4

**5**  One shall say, I am the [[#^note-5a|Lord's]]; and another shall call himself by the [[#^note-5b|name]] of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel. ^verse-5

**6**  Thus saith the Lord the [[#^note-6a|King]] of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the [[#^note-6b|first]], and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. ^verse-6

**7**  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Fear]] ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a [[#^note-8b|God]] beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ They that make a graven [[#^note-9a|image]] are all of them vanity; and their [[#^note-9b|delectable things]] shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they [[#^note-9c|see not]], nor know; that they may be ashamed. ^verse-9

**10**  Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven [[#^note-10a|image]] that is profitable for nothing? ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, all his [[#^note-11a|fellows]] shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together. ^verse-11

**12**  The [[#^note-12a|smith]] with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. ^verse-12

**13**  The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house. ^verse-13

**14**  He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it. ^verse-14

**15**  Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. ^verse-15

**16**  He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: ^verse-16

**17**  And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. ^verse-17

**18**  They have not [[#^note-18a|known]] nor understood: for he hath [[#^note-18b|shut]] their eyes, that they cannot see; and their [[#^note-18c|hearts]], that they cannot understand. ^verse-18

**19**  And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the [[#^note-19a|stock]] of a tree? ^verse-19

**20**  He feedeth on ashes: a [[#^note-20a|deceived]] heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a [[#^note-20b|lie]] in my right hand? ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Remember [[#^note-21a|these]], O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my [[#^note-21b|servant]]: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be [[#^note-21c|forgotten]] of me. ^verse-21

**22**  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy [[#^note-22a|transgressions]], and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|Sing]], O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into [[#^note-23b|singing]], ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath [[#^note-23c|redeemed]] Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. ^verse-23

**24**  Thus saith the Lord, thy [[#^note-24a|redeemer]], and he that [[#^note-24b|formed]] thee from the womb, I am the Lord that [[#^note-24c|maketh]] all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; ^verse-24

**25**  That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth [[#^note-25a|wise]] men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; ^verse-25

**26**  That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof: ^verse-26

**27**  That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will [[#^note-27a|dry up]] thy rivers: ^verse-27

**28**  That saith of [[#^note-28a|Cyrus]], He is my [[#^note-28b|shepherd]], and shall perform all my [[#^note-28c|pleasure]]: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be [[#^note-28d|built]]; and to the [[#^note-28e|temple]], Thy foundation shall be laid. ^verse-28
