*Mordecai, the Jew, stands next to Ahasuerus in power and might.*

**1**  And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. ^verse-1

**2**  And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king [[#^note-2a|advanced]] him, are they not written in the book of the [[#^note-2b|chronicles]] of the kings of Media and Persia? ^verse-2

**3**  For Mordecai the [[#^note-3a|Jew]] was [[#^note-3b|next]] unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed. ^verse-3
