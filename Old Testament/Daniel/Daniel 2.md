*Nebuchadnezzar's dream is revealed to Daniel—The king saw a great image, a stone cut from the mountain without hands destroyed the image, and the stone grew and filled the whole earth—The stone is the latter-day kingdom of God.*

**1**  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed [[#^note-1a|dreams]], wherewith his spirit was [[#^note-1b|troubled]], and his sleep brake from him. ^verse-1

**2**  Then the king commanded to call the [[#^note-2a|magicians]], and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. ^verse-2

**3**  And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. ^verse-3

**4**  Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in [[#^note-4a|Syriack]], O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will [[#^note-4b|shew]] the interpretation. ^verse-4

**5**  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is [[#^note-5a|gone from me]]: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be [[#^note-5b|cut]] in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. ^verse-5

**6**  But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. ^verse-6

**7**  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. ^verse-7

**8**  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. ^verse-8

**9**  But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, [[#^note-9a|till]] the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. ^verse-10

**11**  And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the [[#^note-11a|gods]], whose dwelling is not with flesh. ^verse-11

**12**  For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. ^verse-12

**13**  And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: ^verse-14

**15**  He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so [[#^note-15a|hasty]] from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. ^verse-15

**16**  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. ^verse-16

**17**  Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to [[#^note-17a|Hananiah]], Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: ^verse-17

**18**  That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ Then was the [[#^note-19a|secret]] revealed unto Daniel in a night [[#^note-19b|vision]]. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. ^verse-19

**20**  Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for [[#^note-20a|wisdom]] and might are his: ^verse-20

**21**  And he changeth the [[#^note-21a|times]] and the [[#^note-21b|seasons]]: he [[#^note-21c|removeth]] kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth [[#^note-21d|wisdom]] unto the wise, and [[#^note-21e|knowledge]] to them that know understanding: ^verse-21

**22**  He [[#^note-22a|revealeth]] the deep and secret things: he [[#^note-22b|knoweth]] what is in the darkness, and the [[#^note-22c|light]] dwelleth with him. ^verse-22

**23**  I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. ^verse-24

**25**  Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. ^verse-25

**26**  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose [[#^note-26a|name]] was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make [[#^note-26b|known]] unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? ^verse-26

**27**  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the [[#^note-27a|astrologers]], the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; ^verse-27

**28**  But there is a God in heaven that [[#^note-28a|revealeth]] [[#^note-28b|secrets]], and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy [[#^note-28c|dream]], and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; ^verse-28

**29**  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that [[#^note-29a|revealeth]] secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. ^verse-29

**30**  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any [[#^note-30a|wisdom]] that I have more than any living, but [[#^note-30b|for]] their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great [[#^note-31a|image]]. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before [[#^note-31b|the]]e; and the form thereof was terrible. ^verse-31

**32**  This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, ^verse-32

**33**  His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. ^verse-33

**34**  Thou sawest till that a [[#^note-34a|stone]] was cut out [[#^note-34b|without]] hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. ^verse-34

**35**  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no [[#^note-35a|place]] was found for them: and the [[#^note-35b|stone]] that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. ^verse-36

**37**  Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a [[#^note-37a|kingdom]], power, and strength, and glory. ^verse-37

**38**  And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this [[#^note-38a|head]] of gold. ^verse-38

**39**  And after thee shall arise another [[#^note-39a|kingdom]] inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear [[#^note-39b|rule]] over all the earth. ^verse-39

**40**  And the fourth [[#^note-40a|kingdom]] shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. ^verse-40

**41**  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of [[#^note-41a|iron]], the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. ^verse-41

**42**  And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. ^verse-42

**43**  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. ^verse-43

**44**  And in the [[#^note-44a|days]] of these [[#^note-44b|kings]] shall the God of heaven [[#^note-44c|set]] up a [[#^note-44d|kingdom]], which shall never be [[#^note-44e|destroyed]]: and the [[#^note-44f|kingdom]] shall not be left to other people, but it shall [[#^note-44g|break]] in pieces and [[#^note-44h|consume]] all these [[#^note-44i|kingdoms]], and it shall stand for ever. ^verse-44

**45**  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the [[#^note-45a|stone]] was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made [[#^note-45b|known]] to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. ^verse-45

**46**  ¶ Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and [[#^note-46a|worshipped]] Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. ^verse-46

**47**  The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your [[#^note-47a|God]] is a [[#^note-47b|God]] of gods, and a [[#^note-47c|Lord]] of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. ^verse-47

**48**  Then the king made Daniel a [[#^note-48a|great]] man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. ^verse-48

**49**  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he [[#^note-49a|set]] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel [[#^note-49b|sat]] in the gate of the king. ^verse-49
