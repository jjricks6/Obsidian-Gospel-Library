*Daniel fasts, confesses, and prays for all Israel—Gabriel reveals the time of the coming of the Messiah, who will make reconciliation for iniquity—The Messiah will be cut off.*

**1**  In the first year of [[#^note-1a|Darius]] the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; ^verse-1

**2**  In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish [[#^note-2a|seventy]] years in the [[#^note-2b|desolations]] of Jerusalem. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And I set my face unto the Lord God, to [[#^note-3a|seek]] by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and [[#^note-3b|sackcloth]], and ashes: ^verse-3

**4**  And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my [[#^note-4a|confession]], and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, [[#^note-4b|keeping]] the covenant and [[#^note-4c|mercy]] to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; ^verse-4

**5**  We have [[#^note-5a|sinned]], and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: ^verse-5

**6**  Neither have we [[#^note-6a|hearkened]] unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. ^verse-6

**7**  O Lord, [[#^note-7a|righteousness]] belongeth unto thee, but unto us [[#^note-7b|confusion of faces]], as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. ^verse-7

**8**  O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. ^verse-8

**9**  To the Lord our God belong mercies and [[#^note-9a|forgivenesses]], though we have [[#^note-9b|rebelled]] against him; ^verse-9

**10**  Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to [[#^note-10a|walk]] in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not [[#^note-11a|obey]] thy voice; therefore the [[#^note-11b|curse]] is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. ^verse-11

**12**  And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great [[#^note-12a|evil]]: for under the whole heaven hath not been [[#^note-12b|done]] as hath been done upon Jerusalem. ^verse-12

**13**  As it is written in the [[#^note-13a|law]] of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the [[#^note-14a|evil]], and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we [[#^note-14b|obeyed not]] his voice. ^verse-14

**15**  And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ O Lord, according to all thy [[#^note-16a|righteousness]], I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy [[#^note-16b|mountain]]: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a [[#^note-16c|reproach]] to all that are about us. ^verse-16

**17**  Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to [[#^note-17a|shine]] upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. ^verse-17

**18**  O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. ^verse-18

**19**  O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; ^verse-20

**21**  Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man [[#^note-21a|Gabriel]], whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, [[#^note-21b|touched]] me about the time of the [[#^note-21c|evening]] oblation. ^verse-21

**22**  And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O [[#^note-22a|Daniel]], I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. ^verse-22

**23**  At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. ^verse-23

**24**  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make [[#^note-24a|reconciliation]] for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. ^verse-24

**25**  Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the [[#^note-25a|wall]], even in troublous times. ^verse-25

**26**  And after threescore and two weeks shall [[#^note-26a|Messiah]] be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall [[#^note-26b|destroy]] the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. ^verse-26

**27**  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of [[#^note-27a|abominations]] he shall make it [[#^note-27b|desolate]], even until the [[#^note-27c|consummation]], and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. ^verse-27
