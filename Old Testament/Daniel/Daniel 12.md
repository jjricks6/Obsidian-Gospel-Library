[[Old Testament/Daniel/Daniel 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Hosea|Next Entry]]

*In the last days, Michael will deliver Israel from their troubles—Daniel tells of the two resurrections—The wise will know the times and meanings of his visions.*

**1**  And at that time shall [[#^note-1a|Michael]] stand up, the great prince [[#^note-1b|which standeth for]] the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of [[#^note-1c|trouble]], such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the [[#^note-1d|book]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And many of them that [[#^note-2a|sleep]] in the dust of the earth shall [[#^note-2b|awake]], some to [[#^note-2c|everlasting life]], and some to [[#^note-2d|shame]] and [[#^note-2e|everlasting contempt]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And they that be [[#^note-3a|wise]] shall [[#^note-3b|shine]] as the [[#^note-3c|brightness]] of the firmament; and they that turn many to [[#^note-3d|righteousness]] as the stars for ever and ever. ^verse-3

**4**  But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and [[#^note-4a|seal]] the [[#^note-4b|book]], even to the [[#^note-4c|time]] of the end: many shall run to and fro, and [[#^note-4d|knowledge]] shall be increased. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. ^verse-5

**6**  And one said to the man [[#^note-6a|clothed]] in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? ^verse-6

**7**  And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and [[#^note-7a|sware]] by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to [[#^note-7b|scatter]] the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. ^verse-7

**8**  And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the [[#^note-8a|end]] of these things? ^verse-8

**9**  And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and [[#^note-9a|sealed]] till the time of the end. ^verse-9

**10**  Many shall be [[#^note-10a|purified]], and made white, and [[#^note-10b|tried]]; but the [[#^note-10c|wicked]] shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall [[#^note-10d|understand]]; but the wise shall understand. ^verse-10

**11**  And from the time that the daily [[#^note-11a|sacrifice]] shall be taken away, and the [[#^note-11b|abomination]] that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. ^verse-11

**12**  Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. ^verse-12

**13**  But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt [[#^note-13a|rest]], and [[#^note-13b|stand in thy lot]] at the end of the days. ^verse-13
