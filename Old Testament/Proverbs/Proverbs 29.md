[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 28|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 30|Next Entry]]

*When the wicked rule, the people mourn—The righteous consider the cause of the poor—A fool speaks all that is in his mind—Where there is no vision, the people perish.*

**1**  He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without [[#^note-1a|remedy]]. ^verse-1

**2**  When the [[#^note-2a|righteous]] are in [[#^note-2b|authority]], the people [[#^note-2c|rejoice]]: but when the [[#^note-2d|wicked]] beareth [[#^note-2e|rule]], the people [[#^note-2f|mourn]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots [[#^note-3a|spendeth]] his substance. ^verse-3

**4**  The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. ^verse-4

**5**  A man that [[#^note-5a|flattereth]] his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. ^verse-5

**6**  In the [[#^note-6a|transgression]] of an evil man there is a [[#^note-6b|snare]]: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. ^verse-6

**7**  The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. ^verse-7

**8**  Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. ^verse-8

**9**  If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. ^verse-9

**10**  The [[#^note-10a|bloodthirsty]] hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. ^verse-10

**11**  A fool [[#^note-11a|uttereth]] all his [[#^note-11b|mind]]: but a [[#^note-11c|wise]] man keepeth it in till afterwards. ^verse-11

**12**  If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. ^verse-12

**13**  The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the Lord lighteneth both their eyes. ^verse-13

**14**  The [[#^note-14a|king]] that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|rod]] and [[#^note-15b|reproof]] give wisdom: but a [[#^note-15c|child]] left to himself bringeth his [[#^note-15d|mother]] to [[#^note-15e|shame]]. ^verse-15

**16**  When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. ^verse-16

**17**  Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. ^verse-17

**18**  Where there is no [[#^note-18a|vision]], the people [[#^note-18b|perish]]: but he that [[#^note-18c|keepeth]] the [[#^note-18d|law]], [[#^note-18e|happy]] is he. ^verse-18

**19**  A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. ^verse-19

**20**  Seest thou a man that is [[#^note-20a|hasty]] in his words? there is more hope of a [[#^note-20b|fool]] than of him. ^verse-20

**21**  He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. ^verse-21

**22**  An [[#^note-22a|angry]] man stirreth up [[#^note-22b|strife]], and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. ^verse-22

**23**  A man's [[#^note-23a|pride]] shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the [[#^note-23b|humble]] in spirit. ^verse-23

**24**  Whoso is partner with a thief [[#^note-24a|hateth]] his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. ^verse-24

**25**  The [[#^note-25a|fear]] of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his [[#^note-25b|trust]] in the Lord shall be safe. ^verse-25

**26**  Many seek the ruler's [[#^note-26a|favour]]; but every man's judgment cometh from the Lord. ^verse-26

**27**  An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the [[#^note-27a|wicked]]. ^verse-27
