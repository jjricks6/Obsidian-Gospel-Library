*The way of the transgressor is hard—Evil pursues sinners—He who does not discipline his children hates them.*

**1**  A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. ^verse-1

**2**  A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. ^verse-2

**3**  He that keepeth his [[#^note-3a|mouth]] keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his [[#^note-3b|lips]] shall have destruction. ^verse-3

**4**  The soul of the [[#^note-4a|sluggard]] desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. ^verse-4

**5**  A righteous man [[#^note-5a|hateth]] lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Righteousness]] keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. ^verse-6

**7**  There is that maketh himself [[#^note-7a|rich]], yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great [[#^note-7b|riches]]. ^verse-7

**8**  The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. ^verse-8

**9**  The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the [[#^note-9a|lamp]] of the wicked shall be put out. ^verse-9

**10**  Only by [[#^note-10a|pride]] cometh [[#^note-10b|contention]]: but with the well advised is wisdom. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Wealth]] gotten by [[#^note-11b|vanity]] shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by [[#^note-11c|labour]] shall increase. ^verse-11

**12**  Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. ^verse-12

**13**  Whoso [[#^note-13a|despiseth]] the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be [[#^note-13b|rewarded]]. ^verse-13

**14**  The law of the wise is a [[#^note-14a|fountain]] of life, to depart from the snares of death. ^verse-14

**15**  Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. ^verse-15

**16**  Every [[#^note-16a|prudent]] man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly. ^verse-16

**17**  A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. ^verse-17

**18**  Poverty and [[#^note-18a|shame]] shall be to him that refuseth [[#^note-18b|instruction]]: but he that regardeth [[#^note-18c|reproof]] shall be honoured. ^verse-18

**19**  The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. ^verse-19

**20**  He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Evil]] pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. ^verse-21

**22**  A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the [[#^note-22a|just]]. ^verse-22

**23**  Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. ^verse-23

**24**  He that spareth his [[#^note-24a|rod]] hateth his son: but he that loveth him [[#^note-24b|chasteneth]] him betimes. ^verse-24

**25**  The righteous eateth to the [[#^note-25a|satisfying]] of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. ^verse-25
