*A prudent wife is from the Lord—He who lends to the poor lends to the Lord—It is better to be a poor man than to be a liar.*

**1**  Better is the [[#^note-1a|poor]] that walketh in his [[#^note-1b|integrity]], than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. ^verse-1

**2**  Also, that the soul be without [[#^note-2a|knowledge]], it is not good; and he that [[#^note-2b|hasteth]] with his feet sinneth. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|foolishness]] of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  Wealth maketh many [[#^note-4a|friends]]; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. ^verse-4

**5**  A false [[#^note-5a|witness]] shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh [[#^note-5b|lies]] shall not escape. ^verse-5

**6**  Many will entreat the [[#^note-6a|favour]] of the prince: and every man is a [[#^note-6b|friend]] to him that giveth gifts. ^verse-6

**7**  All the brethren of the [[#^note-7a|poor]] do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. ^verse-7

**8**  He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth [[#^note-8a|understanding]] shall find good. ^verse-8

**9**  A false witness shall not be [[#^note-9a|unpunished]], and he that speaketh [[#^note-9b|lies]] shall perish. ^verse-9

**10**  Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a [[#^note-10a|servant]] to have rule over princes. ^verse-10

**11**  The [[#^note-11a|discretion]] of a man deferreth his [[#^note-11b|anger]]; and it is his [[#^note-11c|glory]] to pass over a [[#^note-11d|transgression]]. ^verse-11

**12**  The king's wrath is as the [[#^note-12a|roaring]] of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. ^verse-12

**13**  A foolish son is the calamity of his [[#^note-13a|father]]: and the contentions of a [[#^note-13b|wife]] are a [[#^note-13c|continual]] dropping. ^verse-13

**14**  House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a [[#^note-14a|prudent]] wife is from the Lord. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Slothfulness]] casteth into a deep sleep; and an [[#^note-15b|idle]] soul shall suffer hunger. ^verse-15

**16**  He that [[#^note-16a|keepeth]] the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. ^verse-16

**17**  He that hath [[#^note-17a|pity]] upon the [[#^note-17b|poor]] lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Chasten]] thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. ^verse-18

**19**  A man of great [[#^note-19a|wrath]] shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. ^verse-19

**20**  Hear counsel, and receive [[#^note-20a|instruction]], that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. ^verse-20

**21**  There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the [[#^note-21a|counsel]] of the Lord, that shall stand. ^verse-21

**22**  The desire of a man is his [[#^note-22a|kindness]]: and a poor man is better than a [[#^note-22b|liar]]. ^verse-22

**23**  The [[#^note-23a|fear]] of the Lord tendeth to [[#^note-23b|life]]: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. ^verse-23

**24**  A [[#^note-24a|slothful]] man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ^verse-24

**25**  Smite a [[#^note-25a|scorner]], and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. ^verse-25

**26**  He that wasteth his [[#^note-26a|father]], and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. ^verse-26

**27**  Cease, my son, to [[#^note-27a|hear]] the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. ^verse-27

**28**  An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. ^verse-28

**29**  Judgments are prepared for scorners, and [[#^note-29a|stripes]] for the back of fools. ^verse-29
