*The Lord gives wisdom, knowledge, and understanding—Walk in the way of good men.*

**1**  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and [[#^note-1a|hide]] my commandments with thee; ^verse-1

**2**  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine [[#^note-2a|heart]] to understanding; ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; ^verse-3

**4**  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; ^verse-4

**5**  Then shalt thou understand the [[#^note-5a|fear]] of the Lord, and find the [[#^note-5b|knowledge]] of God. ^verse-5

**6**  For the Lord giveth [[#^note-6a|wisdom]]: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and [[#^note-6b|understanding]]. ^verse-6

**7**  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a [[#^note-7a|buckler]] to them that [[#^note-7b|walk]] uprightly. ^verse-7

**8**  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. ^verse-8

**9**  Then shalt thou [[#^note-9a|understand]] righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Discretion]] shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: ^verse-11

**12**  To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; ^verse-12

**13**  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to [[#^note-13a|walk]] in the ways of darkness; ^verse-13

**14**  Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the [[#^note-14a|frowardness]] of the wicked; ^verse-14

**15**  Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: ^verse-15

**16**  To deliver thee from the [[#^note-16a|strange woman]], even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; ^verse-16

**17**  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. ^verse-17

**18**  For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. ^verse-18

**19**  None that go unto her [[#^note-19a|return]] again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. ^verse-19

**20**  That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. ^verse-20

**21**  For the [[#^note-21a|upright]] shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. ^verse-21

**22**  But the wicked shall be [[#^note-22a|cut off]] from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. ^verse-22
