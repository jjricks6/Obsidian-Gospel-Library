*Every word of God is pureâ€”Give me neither poverty nor riches.*

**1**  The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, ^verse-1

**2**  Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. ^verse-2

**3**  I neither learned wisdom, nor have the [[#^note-3a|knowledge]] of the holy. ^verse-3

**4**  Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? ^verse-4

**5**  Every word of God is [[#^note-5a|pure]]: he is a [[#^note-5b|shield]] unto them that put their trust in him. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Add]] thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. ^verse-6

**7**  Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: ^verse-7

**8**  Remove far from me [[#^note-8a|vanity]] and lies: give me neither poverty nor [[#^note-8b|riches]]; feed me with [[#^note-8c|food convenient for me]]: ^verse-8

**9**  Lest I be full, and [[#^note-9a|deny]] thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. ^verse-9

**10**  Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. ^verse-10

**11**  There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. ^verse-11

**12**  There is a [[#^note-12a|generation]] that are [[#^note-12b|pure]] in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their [[#^note-12c|filthiness]]. ^verse-12

**13**  There is a generation, O how lofty are their [[#^note-13a|eyes]]! and their eyelids are lifted up. ^verse-13

**14**  There is a generation, whose [[#^note-14a|teeth]] are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|horseleach]] hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: ^verse-15

**16**  The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. ^verse-16

**17**  The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. ^verse-17

**18**  There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: ^verse-18

**19**  The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. ^verse-19

**20**  Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her [[#^note-20a|mouth]], and saith, I have done no wickedness. ^verse-20

**21**  For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: ^verse-21

**22**  For a [[#^note-22a|servant]] when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; ^verse-22

**23**  For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. ^verse-23

**24**  There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: ^verse-24

**25**  The [[#^note-25a|ants]] are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; ^verse-25

**26**  The [[#^note-26a|conies]] are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; ^verse-26

**27**  The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; ^verse-27

**28**  The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. ^verse-28

**29**  There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: ^verse-29

**30**  A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; ^verse-30

**31**  A [[#^note-31a|greyhound]]; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. ^verse-31

**32**  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. ^verse-32

**33**  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth [[#^note-33a|strife]]. ^verse-33
