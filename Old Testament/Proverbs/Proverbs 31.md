### Chapter 31

[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 30|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes|Next Entry]]

*Wine and strong drink are condemned—Plead the cause of the poor and needy—A virtuous woman is more precious than rubies.*

**1**  The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his [[#^note-1a|mother]] taught him. ^verse-1

**2**  What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? ^verse-2

**3**  Give not thy strength unto [[#^note-3a|women]], nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. ^verse-3

**4**  It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink [[#^note-4a|wine]]; nor for princes strong drink: ^verse-4

**5**  Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. ^verse-5

**6**  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. ^verse-6

**7**  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. ^verse-7

**8**  Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. ^verse-8

**9**  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the [[#^note-9a|cause]] of the poor and needy. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Who can find a [[#^note-10a|virtuous]] [[#^note-10b|woman]]? for her price is far above rubies. ^verse-10

**11**  The heart of her husband doth safely [[#^note-11a|trust]] in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. ^verse-11

**12**  She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. ^verse-12

**13**  She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her [[#^note-13a|hands]]. ^verse-13

**14**  She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. ^verse-14

**15**  She [[#^note-15a|riseth]] also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. ^verse-15

**16**  She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. ^verse-16

**17**  She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. ^verse-17

**18**  She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. ^verse-18

**19**  She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the [[#^note-19a|distaff]]. ^verse-19

**20**  She stretcheth out her hand to the [[#^note-20a|poor]]; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. ^verse-20

**21**  She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. ^verse-21

**22**  She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her [[#^note-22a|clothing]] is silk and purple. ^verse-22

**23**  Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. ^verse-23

**24**  She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. ^verse-24

**25**  Strength and honour are her [[#^note-25a|clothing]]; and she shall rejoice in time to come. ^verse-25

**26**  She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of [[#^note-26a|kindness]]. ^verse-26

**27**  She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of [[#^note-27a|idleness]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. ^verse-28

**29**  Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. ^verse-29

**30**  Favour is deceitful, and [[#^note-30a|beauty]] is vain: but a woman that [[#^note-30b|feareth the Lord]], she shall be praised. ^verse-30

**31**  Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. ^verse-31
