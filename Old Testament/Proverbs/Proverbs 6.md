*Six things that the Lord hates are named—Those who commit adultery destroy their own souls.*

**1**  My son, if thou [[#^note-1a|be]] surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, ^verse-1

**2**  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. ^verse-2

**3**  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, [[#^note-3a|humble]] thyself, and make sure thy friend. ^verse-3

**4**  Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. ^verse-4

**5**  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Go to the [[#^note-6a|ant]], thou [[#^note-6b|sluggard]]; consider her ways, and be wise: ^verse-6

**7**  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, ^verse-7

**8**  Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. ^verse-8

**9**  How long wilt thou [[#^note-9a|sleep]], O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? ^verse-9

**10**  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: ^verse-10

**11**  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a [[#^note-12a|froward]] mouth. ^verse-12

**13**  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; ^verse-13

**14**  Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without [[#^note-15a|remedy]]. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ These six things doth the Lord [[#^note-16a|hate]]: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: ^verse-16

**17**  A [[#^note-17a|proud]] look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, ^verse-17

**18**  An [[#^note-18a|heart]] that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, ^verse-18

**19**  A [[#^note-19a|false witness]] that speaketh [[#^note-19b|lies]], and he that soweth [[#^note-19c|discord]] among brethren. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ My son, keep thy [[#^note-20a|father's]] commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Bind]] them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. ^verse-21

**22**  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. ^verse-22

**23**  For the commandment is a [[#^note-23a|lamp]]; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: ^verse-23

**24**  To keep thee from the [[#^note-24a|evil]] [[#^note-24b|woman]], from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Lust]] not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. ^verse-25

**26**  For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. ^verse-26

**27**  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? ^verse-27

**28**  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? ^verse-28

**29**  So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. ^verse-29

**30**  Men do not despise a thief, if he [[#^note-30a|steal]] to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; ^verse-30

**31**  But if he be found, he shall [[#^note-31a|restore]] sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. ^verse-31

**32**  But whoso committeth [[#^note-32a|adultery]] with a woman lacketh [[#^note-32b|understanding]]: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. ^verse-32

**33**  A wound and [[#^note-33a|dishonour]] shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. ^verse-33

**34**  For [[#^note-34a|jealousy]] is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. ^verse-34

**35**  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. ^verse-35
