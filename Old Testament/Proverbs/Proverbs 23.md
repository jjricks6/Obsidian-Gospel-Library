*Labor not to be rich—As a man thinks in his heart, so is he—Withhold not correction from a child—Be not among drunkards.*

**1**  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: ^verse-1

**2**  And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to [[#^note-2a|appetite]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Be not desirous of his [[#^note-3a|dainties]]: for they are deceitful meat. ^verse-3

**4**  Labour not to be [[#^note-4a|rich]]: cease from thine own [[#^note-4b|wisdom]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. ^verse-5

**6**  Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: ^verse-6

**7**  For as he [[#^note-7a|thinketh]] in his [[#^note-7b|heart]], so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. ^verse-7

**8**  The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. ^verse-8

**9**  Speak not in the ears of a [[#^note-9a|fool]]: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. ^verse-9

**10**  Remove not the old [[#^note-10a|landmark]]; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: ^verse-10

**11**  For their redeemer is mighty; he shall [[#^note-11a|plead]] their cause with thee. ^verse-11

**12**  Apply thine heart unto [[#^note-12a|instruction]], and thine ears to the words of knowledge. ^verse-12

**13**  Withhold not [[#^note-13a|correction]] from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. ^verse-14

**15**  My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. ^verse-15

**16**  Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. ^verse-16

**17**  Let not thine heart envy [[#^note-17a|sinners]]: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long. ^verse-17

**18**  For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. ^verse-18

**19**  Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. ^verse-19

**20**  Be not among [[#^note-20a|winebibbers]]; among [[#^note-20b|riotous]] eaters of flesh: ^verse-20

**21**  For the [[#^note-21a|drunkard]] and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Hearken]] unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. ^verse-22

**23**  Buy the [[#^note-23a|truth]], and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. ^verse-23

**24**  The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. ^verse-24

**25**  Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. ^verse-25

**26**  My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes [[#^note-26a|observe]] my ways. ^verse-26

**27**  For a [[#^note-27a|whore]] is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. ^verse-27

**28**  She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. ^verse-28

**29**  Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath [[#^note-29a|contentions]]? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? ^verse-29

**30**  They that tarry long at the [[#^note-30a|wine]]; they that go to seek mixed wine. ^verse-30

**31**  Look not thou upon the [[#^note-31a|wine]] when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. ^verse-31

**32**  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an [[#^note-32a|adder]]. ^verse-32

**33**  Thine eyes shall behold [[#^note-33a|strange women]], and thine heart shall utter perverse things. ^verse-33

**34**  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. ^verse-34

**35**  They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. ^verse-35
