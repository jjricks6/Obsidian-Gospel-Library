*Boast not of false giftsâ€”Give food and drink to your enemy.*

**1**  These are also [[#^note-1a|proverbs]] of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. ^verse-1

**2**  It is the glory of God to [[#^note-2a|conceal]] a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. ^verse-2

**3**  The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. ^verse-3

**4**  Take away the [[#^note-4a|dross]] from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Take]] away the wicked from before the [[#^note-5b|king]], and his throne shall be established in righteousness. ^verse-5

**6**  Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: ^verse-6

**7**  For better it is that it be said unto thee, [[#^note-7a|Come]] up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. ^verse-7

**8**  Go not forth hastily to [[#^note-8a|strive]], lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. ^verse-8

**9**  Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and [[#^note-9a|discover not]] a secret to another: ^verse-9

**10**  Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. ^verse-10

**11**  A [[#^note-11a|word]] fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. ^verse-11

**12**  As an earring of gold, and an [[#^note-12a|ornament]] of fine gold, so is a wise [[#^note-12b|reprover]] upon an obedient ear. ^verse-12

**13**  As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. ^verse-13

**14**  Whoso [[#^note-14a|boasteth]] himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. ^verse-14

**15**  By long [[#^note-15a|forbearing]] is a prince [[#^note-15b|persuaded]], and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. ^verse-15

**16**  Hast thou found [[#^note-16a|honey]]? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. ^verse-16

**17**  Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. ^verse-17

**18**  A man that [[#^note-18a|beareth]] [[#^note-18b|false witness]] against his neighbour is a [[#^note-18c|maul]], and a [[#^note-18d|sword]], and a sharp arrow. ^verse-18

**19**  Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. ^verse-19

**20**  As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. ^verse-20

**21**  If thine [[#^note-21a|enemy]] be [[#^note-21b|hungry]], give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: ^verse-21

**22**  For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall [[#^note-22a|reward]] thee. ^verse-22

**23**  The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a [[#^note-23a|backbiting]] tongue. ^verse-23

**24**  It is better to [[#^note-24a|dwell]] in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. ^verse-24

**25**  As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. ^verse-25

**26**  A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as [[#^note-26a|a troubled fountain]], and a corrupt spring. ^verse-26

**27**  It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own [[#^note-27a|glory]] is not glory. ^verse-27

**28**  He that hath no [[#^note-28a|rule]] over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. ^verse-28
