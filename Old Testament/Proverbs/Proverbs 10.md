*A wise son makes a glad father—The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life—He who utters slander is a fool—The desire of the righteous will be granted.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|proverbs]] of Solomon. A [[#^note-1b|wise]] son maketh a [[#^note-1c|glad]] [[#^note-1d|father]]: but a [[#^note-1e|foolish]] son is the [[#^note-1f|heaviness]] of his [[#^note-1g|mother]]. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Treasures]] of wickedness profit nothing: but [[#^note-2b|righteousness]] delivereth from death. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. ^verse-3

**4**  He becometh poor that dealeth with a [[#^note-4a|slack]] hand: but the hand of the [[#^note-4b|diligent]] maketh rich. ^verse-4

**5**  He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Blessings]] are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. ^verse-6

**7**  The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the [[#^note-7a|wicked]] shall [[#^note-7b|rot]]. ^verse-7

**8**  The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. ^verse-8

**9**  He that [[#^note-9a|walketh]] [[#^note-9b|uprightly]] walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. ^verse-9

**10**  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. ^verse-10

**11**  The mouth of a [[#^note-11a|righteous]] man is a [[#^note-11b|well]] of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Hatred]] stirreth up [[#^note-12b|strifes]]: but love covereth all sins. ^verse-12

**13**  In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a [[#^note-13a|rod]] is for the back of him that is void of understanding. ^verse-13

**14**  Wise men lay up knowledge: but the [[#^note-14a|mouth]] of the foolish is near destruction. ^verse-14

**15**  The rich man's [[#^note-15a|wealth]] is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|labour]] of the righteous tendeth to [[#^note-16b|life]]: the fruit of the wicked to sin. ^verse-16

**17**  He is in the way of life that keepeth [[#^note-17a|instruction]]: but he that refuseth [[#^note-17b|reproof]] erreth. ^verse-17

**18**  He that hideth [[#^note-18a|hatred]] with lying lips, and he that uttereth a [[#^note-18b|slander]], is a fool. ^verse-18

**19**  In the multitude of [[#^note-19a|words]] there wanteth not sin: but he that [[#^note-19b|refraineth]] his lips is wise. ^verse-19

**20**  The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. ^verse-20

**21**  The lips of the righteous feed many: but [[#^note-21a|fools]] die for want of wisdom. ^verse-21

**22**  The blessing of the Lord, it maketh [[#^note-22a|rich]], and he addeth no sorrow with it. ^verse-22

**23**  It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. ^verse-23

**24**  The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. ^verse-24

**25**  As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. ^verse-25

**26**  As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. ^verse-26

**27**  The [[#^note-27a|fear]] of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. ^verse-27

**28**  The [[#^note-28a|hope]] of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. ^verse-28

**29**  The way of the Lord is [[#^note-29a|strength]] to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. ^verse-29

**30**  The [[#^note-30a|righteous]] shall never be [[#^note-30b|removed]]: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. ^verse-30

**31**  The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the [[#^note-31a|froward]] tongue shall be cut out. ^verse-31

**32**  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the [[#^note-32a|mouth]] of the wicked speaketh frowardness. ^verse-32
