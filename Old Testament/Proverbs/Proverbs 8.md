*Wisdom is greatly to be desiredâ€”The Lord and the sons of men possessed wisdom in the premortal life.*

**1**  Doth not wisdom [[#^note-1a|cry]]? and understanding put forth her voice? ^verse-1

**2**  She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. ^verse-2

**3**  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. ^verse-3

**4**  Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. ^verse-4

**5**  O ye [[#^note-5a|simple]], understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding [[#^note-5b|heart]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. ^verse-6

**7**  For my mouth shall [[#^note-7a|speak]] [[#^note-7b|truth]]; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. ^verse-7

**8**  All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. ^verse-8

**9**  They are all plain to him that [[#^note-9a|understandeth]], and right to them that find [[#^note-9b|knowledge]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. ^verse-10

**11**  For [[#^note-11a|wisdom]] is better than [[#^note-11b|rubies]]; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. ^verse-11

**12**  I wisdom dwell with [[#^note-12a|prudence]], and find out knowledge of witty inventions. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|fear]] of the Lord is to [[#^note-13b|hate]] evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. ^verse-13

**14**  Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. ^verse-14

**15**  By me [[#^note-15a|kings]] reign, and princes decree justice. ^verse-15

**16**  By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  I [[#^note-17a|love]] them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. ^verse-17

**18**  Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable [[#^note-18a|riches]] and righteousness. ^verse-18

**19**  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. ^verse-19

**20**  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: ^verse-20

**21**  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. ^verse-21

**22**  The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his [[#^note-22a|works]] of old. ^verse-22

**23**  I was set up from [[#^note-23a|everlasting]], from the [[#^note-23b|beginning]], or ever the earth was. ^verse-23

**24**  When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. ^verse-24

**25**  Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: ^verse-25

**26**  While as yet he had not made [[#^note-26a|the]] earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. ^verse-26

**27**  When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a [[#^note-27a|compass]] upon the face of the depth: ^verse-27

**28**  When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: ^verse-28

**29**  When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: ^verse-29

**30**  Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; ^verse-30

**31**  Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. ^verse-31

**32**  Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. ^verse-32

**33**  Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. ^verse-33

**34**  Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. ^verse-34

**35**  For whoso findeth me findeth [[#^note-35a|life]], and shall obtain favour of the Lord. ^verse-35

**36**  But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love [[#^note-36a|death]]. ^verse-36
