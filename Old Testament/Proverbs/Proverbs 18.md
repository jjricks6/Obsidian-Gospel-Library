*A fool's mouth is his destruction—Whoever obtains a wife obtains a good thing—A man who has friends must show himself friendly.*

**1**  Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. ^verse-1

**2**  A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. ^verse-2

**3**  When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. ^verse-3

**4**  The words of a man's mouth are as deep [[#^note-4a|waters]], and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. ^verse-4

**5**  It is not good to accept the [[#^note-5a|person]] of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. ^verse-5

**6**  A fool's lips enter into [[#^note-6a|contention]], and his mouth calleth for strokes. ^verse-6

**7**  A fool's [[#^note-7a|mouth]] is his [[#^note-7b|destruction]], and his lips are the snare of his soul. ^verse-7

**8**  The words of a [[#^note-8a|talebearer]] are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^verse-8

**9**  He also that is [[#^note-9a|slothful]] in his work is brother to him that is a great [[#^note-9b|waster]]. ^verse-9

**10**  The name of the Lord is a strong [[#^note-10a|tower]]: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. ^verse-10

**11**  The [[#^note-11a|rich]] man's [[#^note-11b|wealth]] is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. ^verse-11

**12**  Before destruction the heart of man is [[#^note-12a|haughty]], and before honour is [[#^note-12b|humility]]. ^verse-12

**13**  He that [[#^note-13a|answereth]] a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him. ^verse-13

**14**  The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? ^verse-14

**15**  The heart of the [[#^note-15a|prudent]] getteth [[#^note-15b|knowledge]]; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. ^verse-15

**16**  A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. ^verse-16

**17**  He that is [[#^note-17a|first]] in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. ^verse-17

**18**  The [[#^note-18a|lot]] causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. ^verse-18

**19**  A [[#^note-19a|brother]] [[#^note-19b|offended]] is harder to be won than a strong city: and their [[#^note-19c|contentions]] are like the bars of a castle. ^verse-19

**20**  A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. ^verse-20

**21**  Death and life are in the power of the [[#^note-21a|tongue]]: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Whoso]] findeth a [[#^note-22b|wife]] findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  The [[#^note-23a|poor]] useth [[#^note-23b|entreaties]]; but the rich answereth roughly. ^verse-23

**24**  A man that hath [[#^note-24a|friend]]s must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a [[#^note-24b|brother]]. ^verse-24
