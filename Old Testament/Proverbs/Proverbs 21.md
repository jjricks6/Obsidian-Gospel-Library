*Do righteousness and justice—Follow after righteousness and mercy—Safety comes from the Lord.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|king's]] heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. ^verse-1

**2**  Every way of a man is right in his [[#^note-2a|own eyes]]: but the Lord [[#^note-2b|pondereth]] the [[#^note-2c|hearts]]. ^verse-2

**3**  To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than [[#^note-3a|sacrifice]]. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|An high look]], and a [[#^note-4b|proud]] heart, and [[#^note-4c|the]] plowing of the wicked, is sin. ^verse-4

**5**  The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is [[#^note-5a|hasty]] only to want. ^verse-5

**6**  The getting of [[#^note-6a|treasures]] by a lying tongue is a [[#^note-6b|vanity]] tossed to and fro of them that seek death. ^verse-6

**7**  The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|The]] way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right. ^verse-8

**9**  It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, [[#^note-9a|than]] with a brawling [[#^note-9b|woman]] in a [[#^note-9c|wide house]]. ^verse-9

**10**  The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his [[#^note-10a|neighbour]] findeth no favour in his eyes. ^verse-10

**11**  When the [[#^note-11a|scorner]] is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. ^verse-11

**12**  The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the [[#^note-12a|wicked]]: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. ^verse-12

**13**  Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the [[#^note-13a|poor]], he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. ^verse-13

**14**  A gift in secret pacifieth [[#^note-14a|anger]]: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. ^verse-14

**15**  It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of [[#^note-15a|iniquity]]. ^verse-15

**16**  The man that [[#^note-16a|wandereth]] out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. ^verse-16

**17**  He that loveth [[#^note-17a|pleasure]] shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be [[#^note-17b|rich]]. ^verse-17

**18**  The wicked shall be a [[#^note-18a|ransom]] for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. ^verse-18

**19**  It is better to [[#^note-19a|dwell]] in the wilderness, than with a [[#^note-19b|contentious]] and an angry woman. ^verse-19

**20**  There is [[#^note-20a|treasure]] to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man [[#^note-20b|spendeth]] it up. ^verse-20

**21**  He that followeth after [[#^note-21a|righteousness]] and mercy findeth [[#^note-21b|life]], righteousness, and honour. ^verse-21

**22**  A [[#^note-22a|wise]] man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. ^verse-22

**23**  Whoso keepeth his [[#^note-23a|mouth]] and his [[#^note-23b|tongue]] keepeth his soul from troubles. ^verse-23

**24**  Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. ^verse-24

**25**  The desire of the [[#^note-25a|slothful]] killeth him; for his hands refuse to [[#^note-25b|labour]]. ^verse-25

**26**  He [[#^note-26a|coveteth]] greedily all the day long: but the righteous [[#^note-26b|giveth]] and spareth not. ^verse-26

**27**  The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? ^verse-27

**28**  A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. ^verse-28

**29**  A wicked man [[#^note-29a|hardeneth]] his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. ^verse-29

**30**  There is no wisdom nor [[#^note-30a|understanding]] nor counsel against the Lord. ^verse-30

**31**  The [[#^note-31a|horse]] is prepared against the day of battle: but [[#^note-31b|safety]] is of the Lord. ^verse-31
