*The state and rewards of the righteous and the wicked are contrasted—When a wicked man dies, his expectations perish—He who wins souls is wise.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|A]] false [[#^note-1b|balance]] is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight. ^verse-1

**2**  When [[#^note-2a|pride]] cometh, then cometh [[#^note-2b|shame]]: but with the lowly is wisdom. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|integrity]] of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Riches]] profit not in the day of [[#^note-4b|wrath]]: but righteousness delivereth from death. ^verse-4

**5**  The [[#^note-5a|righteousness]] of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall [[#^note-5b|fall]] by his own wickedness. ^verse-5

**6**  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. ^verse-6

**7**  When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. ^verse-7

**8**  The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. ^verse-8

**9**  An [[#^note-9a|hypocrite]] with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the [[#^note-9b|just]] be delivered. ^verse-9

**10**  When it goeth well with the [[#^note-10a|righteous]], the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. ^verse-10

**11**  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. ^verse-11

**12**  He that is void of wisdom despiseth his [[#^note-12a|neighbour]]: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. ^verse-12

**13**  A [[#^note-13a|talebearer]] revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. ^verse-13

**14**  Where no [[#^note-14a|counsel]] is, the people fall: but in the [[#^note-14b|multitude]] of [[#^note-14c|counsellors]] there is safety. ^verse-14

**15**  He that is [[#^note-15a|surety]] for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. ^verse-15

**16**  A gracious [[#^note-16a|woman]] retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches. ^verse-16

**17**  The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is [[#^note-17a|cruel]] troubleth his own flesh. ^verse-17

**18**  The wicked worketh a [[#^note-18a|deceitful]] work: but to him that soweth [[#^note-18b|righteousness]] shall be a sure [[#^note-18c|reward]]. ^verse-18

**19**  As righteousness tendeth to [[#^note-19a|life]]: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. ^verse-19

**20**  They that are [[#^note-20a|of]] a [[#^note-20b|froward]] heart are abomination to the Lord: but such as are upright in their way are his delight. ^verse-20

**21**  Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. ^verse-21

**22**  As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion. ^verse-22

**23**  The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. ^verse-23

**24**  There is that scattereth, and yet [[#^note-24a|increaseth]]; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. ^verse-24

**25**  The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that [[#^note-25a|watereth]] shall be watered also himself. ^verse-25

**26**  He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. ^verse-26

**27**  He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. ^verse-27

**28**  He that [[#^note-28a|trusteth]] in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. ^verse-28

**29**  He that troubleth his own [[#^note-29a|house]] shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. ^verse-29

**30**  The fruit of the righteous is a [[#^note-30a|tree of life]]; and he that winneth souls is wise. ^verse-30

**31**  Behold, the righteous shall be [[#^note-31a|recompensed]] in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner. ^verse-31
