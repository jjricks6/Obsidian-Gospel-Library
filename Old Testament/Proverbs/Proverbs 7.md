[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 8|Next Entry]]

*An immoral woman leads a man to destruction as an ox to the slaughter—The house of an adulterous woman is the way to hell.*

**1**  My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. ^verse-1

**2**  Keep my [[#^note-2a|commandments]], and live; and my law as the [[#^note-2b|apple]] of thine eye. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Bind]] them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine [[#^note-3b|heart]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Say unto [[#^note-4a|wisdom]], Thou art my sister; and call [[#^note-4b|understanding]] thy kinswoman: ^verse-4

**5**  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which [[#^note-5a|flattereth]] with her words. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, ^verse-6

**7**  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, ^verse-7

**8**  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, ^verse-8

**9**  In the [[#^note-9a|twilight]], in the evening, in the black and [[#^note-9b|dark]] night: ^verse-9

**10**  And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an [[#^note-10a|harlot]], and subtil of heart. ^verse-10

**11**  (She is loud and [[#^note-11a|stubborn]]; her feet abide not in her house: ^verse-11

**12**  Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at [[#^note-12a|every]] corner.) ^verse-12

**13**  So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|I]] have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. ^verse-15

**16**  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. ^verse-16

**17**  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, [[#^note-17a|aloes]], and cinnamon. ^verse-17

**18**  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. ^verse-18

**19**  For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: ^verse-19

**20**  He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. ^verse-20

**21**  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. ^verse-21

**22**  He goeth after her [[#^note-22a|straightway]], as an ox goeth to the [[#^note-22b|slaughter]], or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; ^verse-22

**23**  Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the [[#^note-23a|snare]], and knoweth not that it is for his life. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. ^verse-24

**25**  Let not thine [[#^note-25a|heart]] decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. ^verse-25

**26**  For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. ^verse-26

**27**  Her [[#^note-27a|house]] is the way to [[#^note-27b|hell]], going down to the chambers of death. ^verse-27
