*Go from the presence of a foolish man—A true witness delivers souls—Righteousness exalts a nation.*

**1**  Every wise [[#^note-1a|woman]] buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. ^verse-1

**2**  He that [[#^note-2a|walketh]] in his uprightness feareth the Lord: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. ^verse-2

**3**  In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. ^verse-3

**4**  Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. ^verse-4

**5**  A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. ^verse-5

**6**  A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but [[#^note-6a|knowledge]] is easy unto him that understandeth. ^verse-6

**7**  Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. ^verse-7

**8**  The [[#^note-8a|wisdom]] of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is [[#^note-8b|deceit]]. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Fools]] make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour. ^verse-9

**10**  The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. ^verse-10

**11**  The [[#^note-11a|house]] of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the [[#^note-11b|tabernacle]] of the upright shall flourish. ^verse-11

**12**  There is a [[#^note-12a|way]] which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of [[#^note-12b|death]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Even in [[#^note-13a|laughter]] the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that [[#^note-13b|mirth]] is heaviness. ^verse-13

**14**  The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. ^verse-14

**15**  The simple believeth every word: but the [[#^note-15a|prudent]] man looketh well to his going. ^verse-15

**16**  A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is [[#^note-16a|confident]]. ^verse-16

**17**  He that is soon [[#^note-17a|angry]] dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. ^verse-17

**18**  The simple inherit folly: but the [[#^note-18a|prudent]] are crowned with [[#^note-18b|knowledge]]. ^verse-18

**19**  The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. ^verse-19

**20**  The [[#^note-20a|poor]] is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many [[#^note-20b|friends]]. ^verse-20

**21**  He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the [[#^note-21a|poor]], [[#^note-21b|happy]] is he. ^verse-21

**22**  Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. ^verse-22

**23**  In all [[#^note-23a|labour]] there is profit: but the [[#^note-23b|talk]] of the lips tendeth only to penury. ^verse-23

**24**  The crown of the wise is their riches: but the [[#^note-24a|foolishness]] of fools is folly. ^verse-24

**25**  A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. ^verse-25

**26**  In the [[#^note-26a|fear]] of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. ^verse-26

**27**  The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. ^verse-27

**28**  In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. ^verse-28

**29**  He that is [[#^note-29a|slow]] to [[#^note-29b|wrath]] is of great [[#^note-29c|understanding]]: but he that is [[#^note-29d|hasty of spirit]] exalteth folly. ^verse-29

**30**  A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but [[#^note-30a|envy]] the rottenness of the bones. ^verse-30

**31**  He that [[#^note-31a|oppresseth]] the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. ^verse-31

**32**  The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his [[#^note-32a|death]]. ^verse-32

**33**  Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. ^verse-33

**34**  [[#^note-34a|Righteousness]] exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. ^verse-34

**35**  The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame. ^verse-35
