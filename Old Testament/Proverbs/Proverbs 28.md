[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 29|Next Entry]]

*The wicked flee when no man pursues—Whoever walks uprightly will be saved—A faithful man will abound with blessings.*

**1**  The wicked [[#^note-1a|flee]] when no man pursueth: but the [[#^note-1b|righteous]] are bold as a lion. ^verse-1

**2**  For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. ^verse-2

**3**  A poor man that [[#^note-3a|oppresseth]] the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. ^verse-3

**4**  They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. ^verse-4

**5**  Evil men [[#^note-5a|understand]] not judgment: but they that seek the Lord understand all things. ^verse-5

**6**  Better is the poor that walketh in his [[#^note-6a|uprightness]], than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. ^verse-6

**7**  Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of [[#^note-7a|riotous]] men [[#^note-7b|shameth]] his father. ^verse-7

**8**  He that by [[#^note-8a|usury]] and unjust gain [[#^note-8b|increaseth]] his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. ^verse-8

**9**  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the [[#^note-9a|law]], even his [[#^note-9b|prayer]] shall be abomination. ^verse-9

**10**  Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall [[#^note-10a|fall]] himself into his own [[#^note-10b|pit]]: but the upright shall have good [[#^note-10c|things]] in possession. ^verse-10

**11**  The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the [[#^note-11a|poor]] that hath understanding searcheth him out. ^verse-11

**12**  When [[#^note-12a|righteous]] men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. ^verse-12

**13**  He that [[#^note-13a|covereth]] his sins shall not prosper: but whoso [[#^note-13b|confesseth]] and [[#^note-13c|forsaketh]] them shall have mercy. ^verse-13

**14**  Happy is the man that [[#^note-14a|feareth]] alway: but he that [[#^note-14b|hardeneth]] his heart shall fall into mischief. ^verse-14

**15**  As a [[#^note-15a|roaring lion]], and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. ^verse-15

**16**  The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth [[#^note-16a|covetousness]] shall prolong his days. ^verse-16

**17**  A man that doeth violence to the [[#^note-17a|blood]] of any person shall [[#^note-17b|flee to the pit]]; let no man stay him. ^verse-17

**18**  Whoso [[#^note-18a|walketh]] uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. ^verse-18

**19**  He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. ^verse-19

**20**  A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh [[#^note-20a|haste]] to be [[#^note-20b|rich]] shall not be innocent. ^verse-20

**21**  To have [[#^note-21a|respect]] of persons is not good: for for a [[#^note-21b|piece]] of [[#^note-21c|bread]] that man will transgress. ^verse-21

**22**  He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. ^verse-22

**23**  He that [[#^note-23a|rebuketh]] a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that [[#^note-23b|flattereth]] with the tongue. ^verse-23

**24**  Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. ^verse-24

**25**  He that is of a [[#^note-25a|proud]] heart stirreth up [[#^note-25b|strife]]: but he that putteth his [[#^note-25c|trust]] in the Lord shall be [[#^note-25d|made fat]]. ^verse-25

**26**  He that [[#^note-26a|trusteth]] in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. ^verse-26

**27**  He that giveth unto the [[#^note-27a|poor]] shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. ^verse-27

**28**  When the [[#^note-28a|wicked]] rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. ^verse-28
