### Chapter 1

[[Old Testament/Proverbs|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 2|Next Entry]]

*The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge—If sinners entice you, do not consent—Those who hearken to wisdom will dwell safely.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|proverbs]] of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; ^verse-1

**2**  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; ^verse-2

**3**  To receive the [[#^note-3a|instruction]] of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; ^verse-3

**4**  To give subtilty to the [[#^note-4a|simple]], to the young man knowledge and discretion. ^verse-4

**5**  A wise man will hear, and will increase [[#^note-5a|learning]]; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: ^verse-5

**6**  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their [[#^note-6a|dark sayings]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ The [[#^note-7a|fear of the Lord]] is the beginning of [[#^note-7b|knowledge]]: but fools despise [[#^note-7c|wisdom]] and [[#^note-7d|instruction]]. ^verse-7

**8**  My son, hear the [[#^note-8a|instruction]] of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy [[#^note-8b|mother]]: ^verse-8

**9**  For they shall be an [[#^note-9a|ornament]] of [[#^note-9b|grace]] unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ My son, if sinners [[#^note-10a|entice]] thee, [[#^note-10b|consent]] thou not. ^verse-10

**11**  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us [[#^note-11a|lurk privily]] for the innocent without cause: ^verse-11

**12**  Let us [[#^note-12a|swallow]] them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the [[#^note-12b|pit]]: ^verse-12

**13**  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: ^verse-13

**14**  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: ^verse-14

**15**  My son, walk not thou in the way with them; [[#^note-15a|refrain]] thy foot from their path: ^verse-15

**16**  For their feet run to [[#^note-16a|evil]], and make haste to shed blood. ^verse-16

**17**  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. ^verse-17

**18**  And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. ^verse-18

**19**  So are the ways of every one that is [[#^note-19a|greedy]] of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: ^verse-20

**21**  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, ^verse-21

**22**  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their [[#^note-22a|scorning]], and fools [[#^note-22b|hate]] [[#^note-22c|knowledge]]? ^verse-22

**23**  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will [[#^note-23a|pour out]] my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Because I have called, and ye [[#^note-24a|refused]]; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; ^verse-24

**25**  But ye have set at [[#^note-25a|nought]] all my [[#^note-25b|counsel]], and would none of my reproof: ^verse-25

**26**  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; ^verse-26

**27**  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. ^verse-27

**28**  Then shall they [[#^note-28a|call]] upon me, but I will not [[#^note-28b|answer]]; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: ^verse-28

**29**  For that they hated knowledge, and did not [[#^note-29a|choose]] the fear of the Lord: ^verse-29

**30**  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my [[#^note-30a|reproof]]. ^verse-30

**31**  Therefore shall they eat of the [[#^note-31a|fruit]] of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. ^verse-31

**32**  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. ^verse-32

**33**  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. ^verse-33
