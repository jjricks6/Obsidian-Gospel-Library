[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 23|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 25|Next Entry]]

*In a multitude of counselors there is safety—Fret not yourself because of evil men—It is not good to show partiality in judgment.*

**1**  Be not thou [[#^note-1a|envious]] against [[#^note-1b|evil]] men, neither desire to be with them. ^verse-1

**2**  For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. ^verse-2

**3**  Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: ^verse-3

**4**  And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. ^verse-4

**5**  A wise man is [[#^note-5a|strong]]; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. ^verse-5

**6**  For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy [[#^note-6a|war]]: and in [[#^note-6b|multitude]] of [[#^note-6c|counsellors]] there is safety. ^verse-6

**7**  Wisdom is too high for a [[#^note-7a|fool]]: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. ^verse-7

**8**  He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. ^verse-8

**9**  The thought of [[#^note-9a|foolishness]] is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men. ^verse-9

**10**  If thou [[#^note-10a|faint]] in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. ^verse-10

**11**  If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; ^verse-11

**12**  If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that [[#^note-12a|pondereth]] the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his [[#^note-12b|works]]? ^verse-12

**13**  My son, eat thou [[#^note-13a|honey]], because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: ^verse-13

**14**  So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. ^verse-14

**15**  Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: ^verse-15

**16**  For a just man falleth seven times, and [[#^note-16a|riseth]] up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. ^verse-16

**17**  Rejoice not when thine [[#^note-17a|enemy]] falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: ^verse-17

**18**  Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. ^verse-18

**19**  Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou [[#^note-19a|envious]] at the wicked; ^verse-19

**20**  For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the [[#^note-20a|candle]] of the wicked shall be put out. ^verse-20

**21**  My son, [[#^note-21a|fear]] thou the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change: ^verse-21

**22**  For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? ^verse-22

**23**  These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have [[#^note-23a|respect]] of persons in judgment. ^verse-23

**24**  He that saith unto the [[#^note-24a|wicked]], Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: ^verse-24

**25**  But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. ^verse-25

**26**  Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|Prepare]] thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. ^verse-27

**28**  Be not a [[#^note-28a|witness]] against thy neighbour without cause; and [[#^note-28b|deceive]] not with thy lips. ^verse-28

**29**  Say not, I will [[#^note-29a|do]] so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. ^verse-29

**30**  I went by the field of the [[#^note-30a|slothful]], and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; ^verse-30

**31**  And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone [[#^note-31a|wall]] thereof was broken down. ^verse-31

**32**  Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. ^verse-32

**33**  Yet a little [[#^note-33a|sleep]], a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: ^verse-33

**34**  So shall thy poverty come as one [[#^note-34a|that travelleth]]; and thy want as an armed man. ^verse-34
