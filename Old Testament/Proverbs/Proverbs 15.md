[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 16|Next Entry]]

*A soft answer turns away wrath—A wise son makes a glad father—The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord—Before honor comes humility.*

**1**  A [[#^note-1a|soft]] [[#^note-1b|answer]] turneth away [[#^note-1c|wrath]]: but grievous words stir up anger. ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|tongue]] of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out [[#^note-2b|foolishness]]. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|eyes]] of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. ^verse-3

**4**  A wholesome [[#^note-4a|tongue]] is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. ^verse-4

**5**  A [[#^note-5a|fool]] despiseth his father's [[#^note-5b|instruction]]: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. ^verse-5

**6**  In the house of the righteous is much [[#^note-6a|treasure]]: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|lips]] of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. ^verse-7

**8**  The [[#^note-8a|sacrifice]] of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. ^verse-8

**9**  The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord: but he loveth him that followeth after [[#^note-9a|righteousness]]. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Correction]] is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth [[#^note-10b|reproof]] shall [[#^note-10c|die]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? ^verse-11

**12**  A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. ^verse-12

**13**  A [[#^note-13a|merry]] [[#^note-13b|heart]] maketh a [[#^note-13c|cheerful]] countenance: but by [[#^note-13d|sorrow]] of the heart the spirit is broken. ^verse-13

**14**  The heart of him that hath [[#^note-14a|understanding]] seeketh [[#^note-14b|knowledge]]: but the mouth of fools feedeth on [[#^note-14c|foolishness]]. ^verse-14

**15**  All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. ^verse-15

**16**  Better is [[#^note-16a|little]] with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith. ^verse-16

**17**  Better is a dinner of herbs where [[#^note-17a|love]] is, than a [[#^note-17b|stalled ox]] and hatred therewith. ^verse-17

**18**  A [[#^note-18a|wrathful]] man stirreth up [[#^note-18b|strife]]: but he that is slow to [[#^note-18c|anger]] appeaseth [[#^note-18d|strife]]. ^verse-18

**19**  The way of the [[#^note-19a|slothful]] man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain. ^verse-19

**20**  A wise son maketh a glad father: but a [[#^note-20a|foolish]] man despiseth his [[#^note-20b|mother]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of [[#^note-21a|understanding]] walketh uprightly. ^verse-21

**22**  Without [[#^note-22a|counsel]] purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. ^verse-22

**23**  A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a [[#^note-23a|word]] spoken in due [[#^note-23b|season]], how good is it! ^verse-23

**24**  The way of life is [[#^note-24a|above]] to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. ^verse-24

**25**  The Lord will destroy the house of the [[#^note-25a|proud]]: but he will establish the border of the [[#^note-25b|widow]]. ^verse-25

**26**  The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. ^verse-26

**27**  He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. ^verse-27

**28**  The heart of the righteous [[#^note-28a|studieth]] to [[#^note-28b|answer]]: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. ^verse-28

**29**  The Lord is [[#^note-29a|far]] from the [[#^note-29b|wicked]]: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. ^verse-29

**30**  The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat. ^verse-30

**31**  The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. ^verse-31

**32**  He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that [[#^note-32a|heareth]] reproof getteth [[#^note-32b|understanding]]. ^verse-32

**33**  The [[#^note-33a|fear]] of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; and before [[#^note-33b|honour]] is [[#^note-33c|humility]]. ^verse-33
