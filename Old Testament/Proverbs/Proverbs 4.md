[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 5|Next Entry]]

*Keep the commandments and live—With all your getting, get understanding—Go not in the way of evil men.*

**1**  Hear, ye children, the [[#^note-1a|instruction]] of a father, and attend to know understanding. ^verse-1

**2**  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. ^verse-2

**3**  For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. ^verse-3

**4**  He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. ^verse-4

**5**  Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. ^verse-5

**6**  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Wisdom]] is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get [[#^note-7b|understanding]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. ^verse-8

**9**  She shall give to thine head an [[#^note-9a|ornament]] of grace: a crown of [[#^note-9b|glory]] shall she deliver to thee. ^verse-9

**10**  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the [[#^note-10a|years]] of thy life shall be many. ^verse-10

**11**  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have [[#^note-11a|led]] thee in right paths. ^verse-11

**12**  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be [[#^note-12a|straitened]]; and when thou [[#^note-12b|runnest]], thou shalt not stumble. ^verse-12

**13**  Take fast [[#^note-13a|hold]] of [[#^note-13b|instruction]]; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Enter not into the [[#^note-14a|path]] of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. ^verse-14

**15**  Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. ^verse-15

**16**  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. ^verse-16

**17**  For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. ^verse-17

**18**  But the [[#^note-18a|path]] of the [[#^note-18b|just]] is as the shining [[#^note-18c|light]], that [[#^note-18d|shineth]] more and more unto the perfect day. ^verse-18

**19**  The way of the wicked is as [[#^note-19a|darkness]]: they know not at what they stumble. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. ^verse-20

**21**  Let them not depart from thine [[#^note-21a|eyes]]; [[#^note-21b|keep]] them in the midst of thine heart. ^verse-21

**22**  For they are [[#^note-22a|life]] unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. ^verse-23

**24**  Put away from thee a [[#^note-24a|froward]] mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. ^verse-24

**25**  Let thine [[#^note-25a|eyes]] look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|Ponder]] the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. ^verse-26

**27**  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. ^verse-27
