*A good name is better than richesâ€”Train up a child in the way he should go.*

**1**  A good [[#^note-1a|name]] is rather to be chosen than great [[#^note-1b|riches]], and loving favour rather than silver and gold. ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|rich]] and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all. ^verse-2

**3**  A [[#^note-3a|prudent]] man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. ^verse-3

**4**  By [[#^note-4a|humility]] and the [[#^note-4b|fear of the Lord]] are riches, and honour, and life. ^verse-4

**5**  Thorns and snares are in the way of the [[#^note-5a|froward]]: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Train]] up a [[#^note-6b|child]] in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|rich]] ruleth over the poor, and the [[#^note-7b|borrower]] is [[#^note-7c|servant]] to the lender. ^verse-7

**8**  He that [[#^note-8a|soweth]] iniquity shall [[#^note-8b|reap]] vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. ^verse-8

**9**  He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his [[#^note-9a|bread]] to the [[#^note-9b|poor]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Cast out the scorner, and [[#^note-10a|contention]] shall go out; yea, [[#^note-10b|strife]] and reproach shall cease. ^verse-10

**11**  He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. ^verse-11

**12**  The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. ^verse-12

**13**  The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. ^verse-13

**14**  The mouth of [[#^note-14a|strange women]] is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein. ^verse-14

**15**  Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. ^verse-15

**16**  He that [[#^note-16a|oppresseth]] the poor to increase his [[#^note-16b|riches]], and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. ^verse-16

**17**  Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. ^verse-17

**18**  For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. ^verse-18

**19**  That thy trust may be in the Lord, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. ^verse-19

**20**  Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, ^verse-20

**21**  That I might make thee know the certainty of the [[#^note-21a|words]] of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? ^verse-21

**22**  Rob not the [[#^note-22a|poor]], because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: ^verse-22

**23**  For the Lord will [[#^note-23a|plead]] their [[#^note-23b|cause]], and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. ^verse-23

**24**  Make no [[#^note-24a|friendship]] with an [[#^note-24b|angry]] man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: ^verse-24

**25**  Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. ^verse-25

**26**  Be not thou one of them that [[#^note-26a|strike hands]], or of them that are [[#^note-26b|sureties]] for debts. ^verse-26

**27**  If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? ^verse-27

**28**  Remove not the ancient [[#^note-28a|landmark]], which thy fathers have set. ^verse-28

**29**  Seest thou a man [[#^note-29a|diligent]] in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before [[#^note-29b|mean men]]. ^verse-29
