*Wine is a mocker, and strong drink is ragingâ€”Turn to the Lord, and He will save you.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Wine]] is a [[#^note-1b|mocker]], strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. ^verse-1

**2**  The fear of a king is as the [[#^note-2a|roaring]] of a lion: whoso provoketh him to [[#^note-2b|anger]] sinneth against his own soul. ^verse-2

**3**  It is an honour for a man to cease from [[#^note-3a|strife]]: but every [[#^note-3b|fool]] will be [[#^note-3c|meddling]]. ^verse-3

**4**  The [[#^note-4a|sluggard]] will not plow by reason of the [[#^note-4b|cold]]; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Counsel]] in the [[#^note-5b|heart]] of man is like deep [[#^note-5c|water]]; but a man of understanding will draw it out. ^verse-5

**6**  Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? ^verse-6

**7**  The just man [[#^note-7a|walketh]] in his [[#^note-7b|integrity]]: his [[#^note-7c|children]] are blessed after him. ^verse-7

**8**  A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment [[#^note-8a|scattereth]] away all evil with his eyes. ^verse-8

**9**  Who can say, I have made my heart [[#^note-9a|clean]], I am pure from my [[#^note-9b|sin]]? ^verse-9

**10**  Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  Even a child is known by his [[#^note-11a|doings]], whether his [[#^note-11b|work]] be pure, and whether it be right. ^verse-11

**12**  The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them. ^verse-12

**13**  Love not [[#^note-13a|sleep]], lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. ^verse-13

**14**  It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he [[#^note-14a|boasteth]]. ^verse-14

**15**  There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious [[#^note-15a|jewel]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Take his [[#^note-16a|garment]] that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Bread]] of [[#^note-17b|deceit]] is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. ^verse-17

**18**  Every purpose is established by [[#^note-18a|counsel]]: and with good [[#^note-18b|advice]] make [[#^note-18c|war]]. ^verse-18

**19**  He that goeth about as a [[#^note-19a|talebearer]] revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that [[#^note-19b|flattereth]] with his lips. ^verse-19

**20**  Whoso curseth his [[#^note-20a|father]] or his mother, his [[#^note-20b|lamp]] shall be put out in obscure [[#^note-20c|darkness]]. ^verse-20

**21**  An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. ^verse-21

**22**  Say not thou, I will [[#^note-22a|recompense]] evil; but [[#^note-22b|wait]] on the Lord, and he shall save thee. ^verse-22

**23**  Divers weights are an abomination unto the Lord; and [[#^note-23a|a false balance]] is not good. ^verse-23

**24**  Man's [[#^note-24a|goings]] are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way? ^verse-24

**25**  It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry. ^verse-25

**26**  A wise [[#^note-26a|king]] scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. ^verse-26

**27**  The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly. ^verse-27

**28**  Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. ^verse-28

**29**  The [[#^note-29a|glory]] of young men is their strength: and the [[#^note-29b|beauty]] of [[#^note-29c|old]] men is the [[#^note-29d|gray]] head. ^verse-29

**30**  The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do [[#^note-30a|stripes]] the inward parts of the belly. ^verse-30
