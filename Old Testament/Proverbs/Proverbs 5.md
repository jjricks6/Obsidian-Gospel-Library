*Those who associate with immoral women will go down to hell—Rejoice with the wife of your youth.*

**1**  My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: ^verse-1

**2**  That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ For the [[#^note-3a|lips]] of a [[#^note-3b|strange woman]] drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: ^verse-3

**4**  But her [[#^note-4a|end]] is [[#^note-4b|bitter]] as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. ^verse-4

**5**  Her feet go down to [[#^note-5a|death]]; her steps take hold on [[#^note-5b|hell]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. ^verse-6

**7**  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Remove]] thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: ^verse-8

**9**  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: ^verse-9

**10**  Lest strangers be filled with thy [[#^note-10a|wealth]]; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; ^verse-10

**11**  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, ^verse-11

**12**  And say, How have I hated [[#^note-12a|instruction]], and my heart despised reproof; ^verse-12

**13**  And have not [[#^note-13a|obeyed]] the voice of my [[#^note-13b|teachers]], nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! ^verse-13

**14**  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. ^verse-15

**16**  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. ^verse-16

**17**  Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. ^verse-17

**18**  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the [[#^note-18a|wife]] of thy youth. ^verse-18

**19**  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her [[#^note-19a|love]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? ^verse-20

**21**  For the [[#^note-21a|ways]] of man are before the [[#^note-21b|eyes]] of the Lord, and he [[#^note-21c|pondereth]] all his goings. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ His own [[#^note-22a|iniquities]] shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the [[#^note-22b|cords]] of his sins. ^verse-22

**23**  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. ^verse-23
