### Chapter 12

[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 13|Next Entry]]

*A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband—The way of a fool is right in his own eyes—Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.*

**1**  Whoso loveth [[#^note-1a|instruction]] loveth knowledge: but he that hateth [[#^note-1b|reproof]] is brutish. ^verse-1

**2**  A good man obtaineth [[#^note-2a|favour]] of the Lord: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. ^verse-2

**3**  A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. ^verse-3

**4**  A [[#^note-4a|virtuous]] [[#^note-4b|woman]] is a crown to her [[#^note-4c|husband]]: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. ^verse-4

**5**  The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the [[#^note-5a|counsels]] of the wicked are [[#^note-5b|deceit]]. ^verse-5

**6**  The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|wicked]] are [[#^note-7b|overthrown]], and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. ^verse-7

**8**  A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. ^verse-8

**9**  He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that [[#^note-9a|honoureth]] himself, and lacketh bread. ^verse-9

**10**  A righteous man regardeth the life of his [[#^note-10a|beast]]: but the tender mercies of the wicked are [[#^note-10b|cruel]]. ^verse-10

**11**  He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding. ^verse-11

**12**  The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. ^verse-12

**13**  The wicked is snared by the [[#^note-13a|transgression]] of his [[#^note-13b|lips]]: but the just shall come out of trouble. ^verse-13

**14**  A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his [[#^note-14a|mouth]]: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. ^verse-14

**15**  The way of a [[#^note-15a|fool]] is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto [[#^note-15b|counsel]] is wise. ^verse-15

**16**  A fool's wrath is presently known: but a [[#^note-16a|prudent]] man covereth shame. ^verse-16

**17**  He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. ^verse-17

**18**  There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. ^verse-18

**19**  The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. ^verse-19

**20**  Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy. ^verse-20

**21**  There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Lying]] lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal [[#^note-22b|truly]] are his [[#^note-22c|delight]]. ^verse-22

**23**  A [[#^note-23a|prudent]] man concealeth [[#^note-23b|knowledge]]: but the heart of fools proclaimeth [[#^note-23c|foolishness]]. ^verse-23

**24**  The hand of the [[#^note-24a|diligent]] shall bear rule: but the [[#^note-24b|slothful]] shall be under tribute. ^verse-24

**25**  Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. ^verse-25

**26**  The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. ^verse-26

**27**  The [[#^note-27a|slothful]] man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a [[#^note-27b|diligent]] man is precious. ^verse-27

**28**  In the way of [[#^note-28a|righteousness]] is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death. ^verse-28
