[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 10|Next Entry]]

*Rebuke a wise man and he will love you—The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom—The guests of an immoral woman are in the depths of hell.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Wisdom]] hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: ^verse-1

**2**  She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. ^verse-2

**3**  She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, ^verse-3

**4**  Whoso is [[#^note-4a|simple]], let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Come]], eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. ^verse-5

**6**  Forsake the [[#^note-6a|foolish]], and live; and go in the way of [[#^note-6b|understanding]]. ^verse-6

**7**  He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Reprove]] not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will [[#^note-8b|love]] thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: [[#^note-9a|teach]] a just man, and he will [[#^note-9b|increase]] in [[#^note-9c|learning]]. ^verse-9

**10**  The [[#^note-10a|fear]] of the Lord is the beginning of [[#^note-10b|wisdom]]: and the [[#^note-10c|knowledge]] of the [[#^note-10d|holy]] is [[#^note-10e|understanding]]. ^verse-10

**11**  For by me thy [[#^note-11a|days]] shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. ^verse-11

**12**  If thou be [[#^note-12a|wise]], thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt [[#^note-12b|bear]] it. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ A foolish [[#^note-13a|woman]] is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. ^verse-13

**14**  For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, ^verse-14

**15**  To call passengers who go right on their ways: ^verse-15

**16**  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^verse-16

**17**  Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. ^verse-17

**18**  But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of [[#^note-18a|hell]]. ^verse-18
