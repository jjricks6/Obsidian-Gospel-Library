[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 16|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 18|Next Entry]]

*He who is glad at calamities will be punished—A friend loves at all times—Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise.*

**1**  Better is a dry morsel, and [[#^note-1a|quietness]] therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with [[#^note-1b|strife]]. ^verse-1

**2**  A wise [[#^note-2a|servant]] shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|fining pot]] is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord [[#^note-3b|trieth]] the [[#^note-3c|hearts]]. ^verse-3

**4**  A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. ^verse-4

**5**  Whoso [[#^note-5a|mocketh]] the [[#^note-5b|poor]] reproacheth his Maker: and he that is [[#^note-5c|glad]] at calamities shall not be unpunished. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Children's]] children are the [[#^note-6b|crown]] of old men; and the [[#^note-6c|glory]] of [[#^note-6d|children]] are their fathers. ^verse-6

**7**  Excellent [[#^note-7a|speech]] becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. ^verse-7

**8**  A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. ^verse-8

**9**  He that [[#^note-9a|covereth a transgression]] [[#^note-9b|seeketh]] [[#^note-9c|love]]; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. ^verse-9

**10**  A [[#^note-10a|reproof]] entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. ^verse-10

**11**  An evil man seeketh only [[#^note-11a|rebellion]]: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. ^verse-11

**12**  Let a [[#^note-12a|bear]] robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. ^verse-12

**13**  Whoso [[#^note-13a|rewardeth]] [[#^note-13b|evil]] for good, evil shall not depart from his house. ^verse-13

**14**  The beginning of [[#^note-14a|strife]] is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off [[#^note-14b|contention]], before it be meddled with. ^verse-14

**15**  He that [[#^note-15a|justifieth]] the [[#^note-15b|wicked]], and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord. ^verse-15

**16**  Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? ^verse-16

**17**  A [[#^note-17a|friend]] loveth at all times, and a [[#^note-17b|brother]] is born for adversity. ^verse-17

**18**  A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. ^verse-18

**19**  He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that [[#^note-19a|exalteth]] his gate seeketh destruction. ^verse-19

**20**  He that hath a [[#^note-20a|froward]] heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. ^verse-20

**21**  He that begetteth a [[#^note-21a|fool]] doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. ^verse-21

**22**  A [[#^note-22a|merry]] [[#^note-22b|heart]] doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. ^verse-22

**23**  A wicked man taketh a [[#^note-23a|gift]] out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. ^verse-23

**24**  Wisdom is before him that hath [[#^note-24a|understanding]]; but the [[#^note-24b|eyes]] of a fool are in the ends of the earth. ^verse-24

**25**  A [[#^note-25a|foolish]] son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. ^verse-25

**26**  Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. ^verse-26

**27**  He that hath knowledge [[#^note-27a|spareth]] his words: and a man of [[#^note-27b|understanding]] [[#^note-27c|is]] of an excellent spirit. ^verse-27

**28**  Even a fool, when he [[#^note-28a|holdeth]] his peace, is counted wise: and he that [[#^note-28b|shutteth]] his lips is esteemed a man of understanding. ^verse-28
