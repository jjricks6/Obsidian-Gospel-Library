*Let another man praise you—A prudent man foresees evil—Hell and destruction are never full.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Boast]] not thyself of to [[#^note-1b|morrow]]; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. ^verse-1

**2**  Let another man [[#^note-2a|praise]] thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. ^verse-2

**3**  A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's [[#^note-3a|wrath]] is heavier than them both. ^verse-3

**4**  Wrath is [[#^note-4a|cruel]], and [[#^note-4b|anger]] is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? ^verse-4

**5**  Open [[#^note-5a|rebuke]] is better than secret love. ^verse-5

**6**  Faithful are the [[#^note-6a|wounds]] of a [[#^note-6b|friend]]; but the [[#^note-6c|kisses]] of an enemy are [[#^note-6d|deceitful]]. ^verse-6

**7**  The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. ^verse-7

**8**  As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. ^verse-8

**9**  Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. ^verse-9

**10**  Thine own [[#^note-10a|friend]], and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a [[#^note-10b|neighbour]] that is near than a brother far off. ^verse-10

**11**  My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. ^verse-11

**12**  A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. ^verse-12

**13**  Take his [[#^note-13a|garment]] that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a [[#^note-13b|strange woman]]. ^verse-13

**14**  He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a [[#^note-14a|curse]] to him. ^verse-14

**15**  A [[#^note-15a|continual]] dropping in a very rainy day and a [[#^note-15b|contentious]] woman are alike. ^verse-15

**16**  Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. ^verse-16

**17**  Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his [[#^note-17a|friend]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall [[#^note-18a|eat]] the fruit thereof: so he that [[#^note-18b|waiteth]] on his master shall be honoured. ^verse-18

**19**  As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Hell]] and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never [[#^note-20b|satisfied]]. ^verse-20

**21**  As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. ^verse-21

**22**  Though thou shouldest [[#^note-22a|bray]] a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. ^verse-22

**23**  Be thou diligent to know the state of thy [[#^note-23a|flocks]], and look well to thy herds. ^verse-23

**24**  For [[#^note-24a|riches]] are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? ^verse-24

**25**  The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. ^verse-25

**26**  The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. ^verse-26

**27**  And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. ^verse-27
