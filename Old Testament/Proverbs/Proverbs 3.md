[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 4|Next Entry]]

*Write mercy and truth upon the tablet of your heart—Trust in the Lord—Honor Him with your substance—Whom the Lord loves He corrects—Happy is the man who finds wisdom.*

**1**  My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: ^verse-1

**2**  For length of days, and [[#^note-2a|long life]], and [[#^note-2b|peace]], shall they add to thee. ^verse-2

**3**  Let not mercy and [[#^note-3a|truth]] forsake thee: [[#^note-3b|bind]] them about thy neck; write them upon the [[#^note-3c|table]] of thine [[#^note-3d|heart]]: ^verse-3

**4**  So shalt thou find [[#^note-4a|favour]] and good understanding in the sight of God and man. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ [[#^note-5a|Trust]] in the Lord with all thine [[#^note-5b|heart]]; and lean not unto thine [[#^note-5c|own]] [[#^note-5d|understanding]]. ^verse-5

**6**  In all thy ways [[#^note-6a|acknowledge]] him, and he shall [[#^note-6b|direct]] thy [[#^note-6c|paths]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Be not [[#^note-7a|wise]] in thine own eyes: [[#^note-7b|fear]] the Lord, and depart from evil. ^verse-7

**8**  It shall be [[#^note-8a|health]] to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Honour]] the Lord with thy [[#^note-9b|substance]], and with the [[#^note-9c|firstfruits]] of all thine increase: ^verse-9

**10**  So shall thy barns be filled with [[#^note-10a|plenty]], and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ My son, despise not the [[#^note-11a|chastening]] of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction: ^verse-11

**12**  For whom the Lord loveth he [[#^note-12a|correcteth]]; even as a [[#^note-12b|father]] the son in whom he delighteth. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ [[#^note-13a|Happy]] is the man that findeth [[#^note-13b|wisdom]], and the man that getteth [[#^note-13c|understanding]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. ^verse-14

**15**  She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. ^verse-15

**16**  Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand [[#^note-16a|riches]] and honour. ^verse-16

**17**  Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. ^verse-17

**18**  She is a tree of [[#^note-18a|life]] to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. ^verse-18

**19**  The Lord by wisdom hath [[#^note-19a|founded]] the earth; by [[#^note-19b|understanding]] hath he established the heavens. ^verse-19

**20**  By his knowledge the depths are [[#^note-20a|broken up]], and the clouds drop down the dew. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: ^verse-21

**22**  So shall they be life unto thy soul, and [[#^note-22a|grace]] to thy neck. ^verse-22

**23**  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. ^verse-23

**24**  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. ^verse-24

**25**  Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. ^verse-25

**26**  For the Lord shall be thy [[#^note-26a|confidence]], and shall keep thy foot from being taken. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ [[#^note-27a|Withhold]] not [[#^note-27b|good]] from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. ^verse-27

**28**  Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. ^verse-28

**29**  [[#^note-29a|Devise]] not evil against thy [[#^note-29b|neighbour]], seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. ^verse-29

**30**  ¶ [[#^note-30a|Strive]] not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ Envy thou not the [[#^note-31a|oppressor]], and choose none of his ways. ^verse-31

**32**  For the [[#^note-32a|froward]] is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ The [[#^note-33a|curse]] of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. ^verse-33

**34**  Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth [[#^note-34a|grace]] unto the [[#^note-34b|lowly]]. ^verse-34

**35**  The [[#^note-35a|wise]] shall inherit glory: but [[#^note-35b|shame]] shall be the promotion of fools. ^verse-35
