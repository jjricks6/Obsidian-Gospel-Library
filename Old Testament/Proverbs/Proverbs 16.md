*It is better to get wisdom than gold—Pride goes before destruction—The gray hair of the righteous person is a crown of glory.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|preparations]] of the heart in man, and the answer of the [[#^note-1b|tongue]], is from the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  All the ways of a man are [[#^note-2a|clean]] in his [[#^note-2b|own eyes]]; but the Lord weigheth the spirits. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Commit]] thy works unto the Lord, and thy [[#^note-3b|thoughts]] shall be established. ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. ^verse-4

**5**  Every one that is [[#^note-5a|proud]] in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. ^verse-5

**6**  By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the [[#^note-6a|fear]] of the Lord men [[#^note-6b|depart]] from [[#^note-6c|evil]]. ^verse-6

**7**  When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his [[#^note-7a|enemies]] to be at [[#^note-7b|peace]] with him. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Better]] is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. ^verse-8

**9**  A man's heart [[#^note-9a|deviseth]] his way: but the Lord directeth his steps. ^verse-9

**10**  A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. ^verse-10

**11**  A just weight and balance are the Lord's: all the weights of the bag are his work. ^verse-11

**12**  It is an abomination to kings to commit [[#^note-12a|wickedness]]: for the throne is established by righteousness. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Righteous]] [[#^note-13b|lips]] are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. ^verse-13

**14**  The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. ^verse-14

**15**  In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. ^verse-15

**16**  How much better is it to get [[#^note-16a|wisdom]] than gold! and to get [[#^note-16b|understanding]] rather to be chosen than silver! ^verse-16

**17**  The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Pride]] goeth before destruction, and an [[#^note-18b|haughty]] spirit before a fall. ^verse-18

**19**  Better it is to be of an [[#^note-19a|humble]] spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. ^verse-19

**20**  He that [[#^note-20a|handleth]] a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso [[#^note-20b|trusteth]] in the Lord, [[#^note-20c|happy]] is he. ^verse-20

**21**  The wise in heart shall be called [[#^note-21a|prudent]]: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. ^verse-21

**22**  Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly. ^verse-22

**23**  The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. ^verse-23

**24**  Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. ^verse-24

**25**  There is a [[#^note-25a|way]] that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. ^verse-25

**26**  He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. ^verse-26

**27**  An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning [[#^note-27a|fire]]. ^verse-27

**28**  A froward man soweth [[#^note-28a|strife]]: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. ^verse-28

**29**  A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. ^verse-29

**30**  He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. ^verse-30

**31**  [[#^note-31a|The hoary head]] is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. ^verse-31

**32**  He that is slow to [[#^note-32a|anger]] is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. ^verse-32

**33**  The [[#^note-33a|lot]] is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord. ^verse-33
