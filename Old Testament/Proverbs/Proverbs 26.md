[[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Proverbs/Proverbs 27|Next Entry]]

*Honor is not fitting for a fool—Answer not a fool according to his folly—Where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.*

**1**  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so [[#^note-1a|honour]] is not seemly for a fool. ^verse-1

**2**  As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. ^verse-2

**3**  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. ^verse-3

**4**  Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Answer]] a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his [[#^note-5b|own conceit]]. ^verse-5

**6**  He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh [[#^note-6a|damage]]. ^verse-6

**7**  The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ^verse-7

**8**  As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. ^verse-8

**9**  As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ^verse-9

**10**  The great God that formed all things both [[#^note-10a|rewardeth]] the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. ^verse-10

**11**  As a dog returneth to his [[#^note-11a|vomit]], so a fool returneth to his folly. ^verse-11

**12**  Seest thou a man wise in his own [[#^note-12a|conceit]]? there is more hope of a [[#^note-12b|fool]] than of him. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|slothful]] man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. ^verse-13

**14**  As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. ^verse-14

**15**  The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. ^verse-15

**16**  The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. ^verse-16

**17**  He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that [[#^note-17a|taketh]] a dog by the ears. ^verse-17

**18**  As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, ^verse-18

**19**  So is the man that [[#^note-19a|deceiveth]] his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? ^verse-19

**20**  Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no [[#^note-20a|talebearer]], the [[#^note-20b|strife]] ceaseth. ^verse-20

**21**  As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a [[#^note-21a|contentious]] man to kindle strife. ^verse-21

**22**  The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^verse-22

**23**  Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a [[#^note-23a|potsherd]] covered with silver dross. ^verse-23

**24**  He that [[#^note-24a|hateth]] dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up [[#^note-24b|deceit]] within him; ^verse-24

**25**  When he [[#^note-25a|speaketh]] fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. ^verse-25

**26**  Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be [[#^note-26a|shewed]] before the whole congregation. ^verse-26

**27**  Whoso diggeth a [[#^note-27a|pit]] shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. ^verse-27

**28**  A [[#^note-28a|lying]] tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a [[#^note-28b|flattering]] mouth worketh ruin. ^verse-28
