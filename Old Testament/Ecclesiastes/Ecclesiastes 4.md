*Oppression and evil deeds are vanity—The strength of two is better than one—Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king.*

**1**  So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is [[#^note-4a|envied]] of his neighbour. This is also vanity and [[#^note-4b|vexation]] of spirit. ^verse-4

**5**  The [[#^note-5a|fool]] foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. ^verse-5

**6**  Better is an [[#^note-6a|handful]] with [[#^note-6b|quietness]], than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Then I returned, and I saw [[#^note-7a|vanity]] under the sun. ^verse-7

**8**  There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and [[#^note-8a|bereave my soul]] of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a [[#^note-8b|sore travail]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ [[#^note-9a|Two]] are better than one; because they have a good [[#^note-9b|reward]] for their labour. ^verse-9

**10**  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. ^verse-10

**11**  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? ^verse-11

**12**  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Better is a [[#^note-13a|poor]] and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be [[#^note-13b|admonished]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. ^verse-14

**15**  I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. ^verse-15

**16**  There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. ^verse-16
