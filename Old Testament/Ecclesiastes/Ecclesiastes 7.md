*Wisdom gives life to them that have it—All men are sinners—God has made man upright.*

**1**  A good [[#^note-1a|name]] is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. ^verse-1

**2**  ¶ It is better to go to the house of [[#^note-2a|mourning]], than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. ^verse-2

**3**  Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the [[#^note-3a|sadness]] of the countenance the heart is made better. ^verse-3

**4**  The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. ^verse-4

**5**  It is better to hear the [[#^note-5a|rebuke]] of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. ^verse-5

**6**  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the [[#^note-6a|laughter]] of the fool: this also is [[#^note-6b|vanity]]. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Surely oppression maketh a wise man [[#^note-7a|mad]]; and a gift destroyeth the heart. ^verse-7

**8**  Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the [[#^note-8a|patient]] in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. ^verse-8

**9**  Be not [[#^note-9a|hasty]] in thy spirit to be [[#^note-9b|angry]]: for [[#^note-9c|anger]] resteth in the bosom of fools. ^verse-9

**10**  Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. ^verse-11

**12**  For [[#^note-12a|wisdom]] is a [[#^note-12b|defence]], and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth [[#^note-12c|life]] to them that have it. ^verse-12

**13**  Consider the work of God: for who can make that [[#^note-13a|straight]], which he hath made crooked? ^verse-13

**14**  In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of [[#^note-14a|adversity]] consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. ^verse-14

**15**  All things have I seen in the days of my [[#^note-15a|vanity]]: there is a [[#^note-15b|just]] man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. ^verse-15

**16**  Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? ^verse-16

**17**  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? ^verse-17

**18**  It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that [[#^note-18a|feareth God]] shall come forth of them all. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Wisdom]] [[#^note-19b|strengtheneth]] the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. ^verse-19

**20**  For there is not a [[#^note-20a|just]] man upon earth, that doeth good, and [[#^note-20b|sinneth]] not. ^verse-20

**21**  Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: ^verse-21

**22**  For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. ^verse-23

**24**  That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? ^verse-24

**25**  I applied mine [[#^note-25a|heart]] to know, and to search, and to seek out [[#^note-25b|wisdom]], and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: ^verse-25

**26**  And I find more [[#^note-26a|bitter]] than death the [[#^note-26b|woman]], whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the [[#^note-26c|sinner]] shall be [[#^note-26d|taken]] by her. ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, this have I found, saith the [[#^note-27a|preacher]], counting one by one, to find out the account: ^verse-27

**28**  Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. ^verse-28

**29**  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many [[#^note-29a|inventions]]. ^verse-29
