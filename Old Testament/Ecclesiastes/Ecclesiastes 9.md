*God's providence rules over all—All men are subject to time and chance—Wisdom is better than strength—One sinner destroys much good.*

**1**  For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. ^verse-1

**2**  All things come alike to all: there is one [[#^note-2a|event]] to the [[#^note-2b|righteous]], and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that [[#^note-2c|sweareth]], as he that [[#^note-2d|feareth an oath]]. ^verse-2

**3**  This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the [[#^note-3a|dead]]. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ For to him that is joined to all the living there is [[#^note-4a|hope]]: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. ^verse-4

**5**  For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. ^verse-5

**6**  Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a [[#^note-7a|merry]] heart; for God now accepteth thy works. ^verse-7

**8**  Let thy garments be always [[#^note-8a|white]]; and let thy head lack no ointment. ^verse-8

**9**  Live [[#^note-9a|joyfully]] with the [[#^note-9b|wife]] whom thou [[#^note-9c|lovest]] all the days of the life of thy [[#^note-9d|vanity]], which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy [[#^note-9e|portion]] in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. ^verse-9

**10**  Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy [[#^note-10a|might]]; for there is no work, nor device, nor [[#^note-10b|knowledge]], nor wisdom, in the [[#^note-10c|grave]], whither thou goest. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the [[#^note-11a|swift]], nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. ^verse-11

**12**  For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men [[#^note-12a|snared]] in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: ^verse-13

**14**  There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: ^verse-14

**15**  Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. ^verse-15

**16**  Then said I, [[#^note-16a|Wisdom]] is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's [[#^note-16b|wisdom]] is despised, and his words are not heard. ^verse-16

**17**  The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Wisdom]] is better than weapons of war: but one [[#^note-18b|sinner]] destroyeth much good. ^verse-18
