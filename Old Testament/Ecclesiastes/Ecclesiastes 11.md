*Do good and give to them who need—God will bring all men to judgment.*

**1**  Cast thy [[#^note-1a|bread]] upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. ^verse-1

**2**  Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou [[#^note-2a|knowest]] not what evil shall be upon the earth. ^verse-2

**3**  If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. ^verse-3

**4**  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not [[#^note-4a|reap]]. ^verse-4

**5**  As thou knowest not what is the way of the [[#^note-5a|spirit]], nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who [[#^note-5b|maketh]] all. ^verse-5

**6**  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Truly the [[#^note-7a|light]] is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: ^verse-7

**8**  But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of [[#^note-8a|darkness]]; for they shall be many. All that cometh is [[#^note-8b|vanity]]. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart [[#^note-9a|cheer]] thee in the days of thy youth, and [[#^note-9b|walk]] in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into [[#^note-9c|judgment]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away [[#^note-10a|evil]] from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are [[#^note-10b|vanity]]. ^verse-10
