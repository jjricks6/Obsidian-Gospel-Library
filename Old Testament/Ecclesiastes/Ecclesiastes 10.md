*A little folly destroys the reputation of the wise and honorable—The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious—A fool is full of words.*

**1**  Dead flies cause the ointment of the [[#^note-1a|apothecary]] to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little [[#^note-1b|folly]] him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. ^verse-1

**2**  A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. ^verse-3

**4**  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. ^verse-4

**5**  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: ^verse-5

**6**  Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. ^verse-6

**7**  I have seen [[#^note-7a|servants]] upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. ^verse-7

**8**  He that diggeth a pit shall [[#^note-8a|fall]] into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. ^verse-8

**9**  Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. ^verse-9

**10**  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. ^verse-10

**11**  Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. ^verse-11

**12**  The [[#^note-12a|words]] of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a [[#^note-12b|fool]] will swallow up himself. ^verse-12

**13**  The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous [[#^note-13a|madness]]. ^verse-13

**14**  A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? ^verse-14

**15**  The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a [[#^note-16a|child]], and thy princes eat in the morning! ^verse-16

**17**  Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for [[#^note-17a|drunkenness]]! ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ By much [[#^note-18a|slothfulness]] the building decayeth; and through [[#^note-18b|idleness]] of the hands the house droppeth through. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Curse not the [[#^note-20a|king]], no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. ^verse-20
