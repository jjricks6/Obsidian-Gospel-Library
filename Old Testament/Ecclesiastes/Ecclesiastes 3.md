*To every thing there is a season—Whatever God does, it will be forever—God will judge the righteous and the wicked.*

**1**  To every thing there is a [[#^note-1a|season]], and a [[#^note-1b|time]] to every purpose under the heaven: ^verse-1

**2**  A [[#^note-2a|time]] to be born, and a time to [[#^note-2b|die]]; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; ^verse-2

**3**  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; ^verse-3

**4**  A time to weep, and a time to [[#^note-4a|laugh]]; a time to [[#^note-4b|mourn]], and a time to dance; ^verse-4

**5**  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; ^verse-5

**6**  A time to [[#^note-6a|get]], and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; ^verse-6

**7**  A time to [[#^note-7a|rend]], and a time to sew; a time to keep [[#^note-7b|silence]], and a time to speak; ^verse-7

**8**  A time to love, and a time to [[#^note-8a|hate]]; a time of war, and a time of peace. ^verse-8

**9**  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he [[#^note-9a|laboureth]]? ^verse-9

**10**  I have seen the [[#^note-10a|travail]], which God hath given to the sons of men to be [[#^note-10b|exercised]] in it. ^verse-10

**11**  He hath made every thing [[#^note-11a|beautiful]] in his time: also [[#^note-11b|he]] hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the [[#^note-11c|work]] that God maketh from the beginning to the end. ^verse-11

**12**  I know that there is no [[#^note-12a|good]] in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. ^verse-12

**13**  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the [[#^note-13a|gift]] of God. ^verse-13

**14**  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be [[#^note-14a|for]] [[#^note-14b|ever]]: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should [[#^note-14c|fear]] before him. ^verse-14

**15**  That which hath been is [[#^note-15a|now]]; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that [[#^note-16a|wickedness]] was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. ^verse-16

**17**  I said in mine heart, God shall [[#^note-17a|judge]] the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. ^verse-17

**18**  I said in mine heart concerning the [[#^note-18a|estate]] of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are [[#^note-18b|beasts]]. ^verse-18

**19**  For that which [[#^note-19a|befalleth]] the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. ^verse-19

**20**  All go unto one place; all are of the [[#^note-20a|dust]], and all turn to dust again. ^verse-20

**21**  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? ^verse-21

**22**  Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own [[#^note-22a|works]]; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? ^verse-22
