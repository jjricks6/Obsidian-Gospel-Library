### Chapter 1

[[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ecclesiastes/Ecclesiastes 2|Next Entry]]

*Everything under the sun is vanity and vexation of spirit—He who increases in knowledge increases in sorrow.*

**1**  The words of the [[#^note-1a|Preacher]], the son of David, king in Jerusalem. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Vanity]] of vanities, saith the Preacher, [[#^note-2b|vanity]] of vanities; all is vanity. ^verse-2

**3**  What [[#^note-3a|profit]] hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? ^verse-3

**4**  One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the [[#^note-4a|earth]] abideth for ever. ^verse-4

**5**  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. ^verse-5

**6**  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to [[#^note-6a|his circuits]]. ^verse-6

**7**  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. ^verse-7

**8**  All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not [[#^note-8a|satisfied]] with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. ^verse-8

**9**  The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no [[#^note-9a|new]] thing under the sun. ^verse-9

**10**  Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. ^verse-10

**11**  There is no [[#^note-11a|remembrance]] of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. ^verse-12

**13**  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by [[#^note-13a|wisdom]] concerning all things that are done under heaven: this [[#^note-13b|sore travail]] hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. ^verse-13

**14**  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is [[#^note-14a|vanity]] and [[#^note-14b|vexation of spirit]]. ^verse-14

**15**  That which is [[#^note-15a|crooked]] cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|I]] communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. ^verse-16

**17**  And I gave my [[#^note-17a|heart]] to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. ^verse-17

**18**  For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth [[#^note-18a|knowledge]] increaseth [[#^note-18b|sorrow]]. ^verse-18
