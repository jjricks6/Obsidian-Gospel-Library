*God is in heaven—A fool's voice is known by a multitude of words—Keep your vows—Riches and wealth are the gift of God.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Keep]] thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. ^verse-1

**2**  Be not [[#^note-2a|rash]] with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be [[#^note-2b|hasty]] to [[#^note-2c|utter]] any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy [[#^note-2d|words]] be few. ^verse-2

**3**  For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words. ^verse-3

**4**  When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast [[#^note-4a|vowed]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Better is it that thou shouldest not [[#^note-5a|vow]], than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. ^verse-5

**6**  Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? ^verse-6

**7**  For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers [[#^note-7a|vanities]]: but [[#^note-7b|fear thou God]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ If thou seest the [[#^note-8a|oppression]] of the poor, and violent perverting of [[#^note-8b|judgment]] and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. ^verse-9

**10**  He that loveth [[#^note-10a|silver]] shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also [[#^note-10b|vanity]]. ^verse-10

**11**  When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? ^verse-11

**12**  The [[#^note-12a|sleep]] of a [[#^note-12b|labouring]] man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. ^verse-12

**13**  There is a [[#^note-13a|sore]] evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. ^verse-13

**14**  But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. ^verse-14

**15**  As he came forth of his mother's womb, [[#^note-15a|naked]] shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. ^verse-15

**16**  And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? ^verse-16

**17**  All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his [[#^note-18a|labour]] that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his [[#^note-18b|portion]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Every man also to whom God hath given [[#^note-19a|riches]] and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his [[#^note-19b|labour]]; this is the [[#^note-19c|gift]] of God. ^verse-19

**20**  For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. ^verse-20
