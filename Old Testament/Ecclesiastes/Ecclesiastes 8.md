*None have power to avoid death—It will not be well with the wicked; he turns to pleasure and cannot find wisdom.*

**1**  Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to [[#^note-1a|shine]], and the boldness of his face shall be changed. ^verse-1

**2**  I counsel thee to keep the [[#^note-2a|king's]] commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. ^verse-2

**3**  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. ^verse-3

**4**  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? ^verse-4

**5**  Whoso keepeth the [[#^note-5a|commandment]] shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both [[#^note-5b|time]] and judgment. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. ^verse-6

**7**  For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? ^verse-7

**8**  There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of [[#^note-8a|death]]: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness [[#^note-8b|deliver]] those that are given to it. ^verse-8

**9**  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. ^verse-9

**10**  And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. ^verse-10

**11**  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed [[#^note-11a|speedily]], therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully [[#^note-11b|set]] in them to do evil. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be [[#^note-12a|well]] with them that [[#^note-12b|fear]] God, which fear before him: ^verse-12

**13**  But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he [[#^note-13a|feareth not before God]]. ^verse-13

**14**  There is a [[#^note-14a|vanity]] which is done upon the earth; that there be [[#^note-14b|just]] men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. ^verse-14

**15**  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ When I applied mine heart to know [[#^note-16a|wisdom]], and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) ^verse-16

**17**  Then I beheld all the [[#^note-17a|work]] of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a [[#^note-17b|wise]] man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. ^verse-17
