*Jeremiah recites in prayer the sorrowful condition of Zion.*

**1**  Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. ^verse-1

**2**  Our inheritance is turned to [[#^note-2a|strangers]], our houses to aliens. ^verse-2

**3**  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. ^verse-3

**4**  We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. ^verse-4

**5**  Our necks are under [[#^note-5a|persecution]]: we labour, and have no rest. ^verse-5

**6**  We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. ^verse-6

**7**  Our [[#^note-7a|fathers]] have [[#^note-7b|sinned]], and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. ^verse-7

**8**  Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. ^verse-8

**9**  We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. ^verse-9

**10**  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. ^verse-10

**11**  They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. ^verse-11

**12**  Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. ^verse-12

**13**  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. ^verse-13

**14**  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. ^verse-14

**15**  The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. ^verse-15

**16**  The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! ^verse-16

**17**  For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. ^verse-17

**18**  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Turn]] thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. ^verse-21

**22**  But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. ^verse-22
