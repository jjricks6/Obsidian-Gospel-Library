*Jeremiah, speaking for Judah, laments the calamity but trusts in the Lord and prays for deliverance.*

**1**  I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. ^verse-1

**2**  He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. ^verse-2

**3**  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. ^verse-3

**4**  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. ^verse-4

**5**  He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. ^verse-5

**6**  He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. ^verse-6

**7**  He hath [[#^note-7a|hedged]] me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. ^verse-7

**8**  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. ^verse-8

**9**  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. ^verse-9

**10**  He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. ^verse-10

**11**  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. ^verse-11

**12**  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. ^verse-12

**13**  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. ^verse-13

**14**  I was a [[#^note-14a|derision]] to all my people; and their song all the day. ^verse-14

**15**  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. ^verse-15

**16**  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. ^verse-16

**17**  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. ^verse-17

**18**  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord: ^verse-18

**19**  Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. ^verse-19

**20**  My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. ^verse-20

**21**  This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. ^verse-22

**23**  They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. ^verse-23

**24**  The Lord is my [[#^note-24a|portion]], saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. ^verse-24

**25**  The Lord is [[#^note-25a|good]] unto them that [[#^note-25b|wait]] for him, to the soul that [[#^note-25c|seeketh]] him. ^verse-25

**26**  It is good that a man should both [[#^note-26a|hope]] and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. ^verse-26

**27**  It is good for a man that he [[#^note-27a|bear]] the yoke in his [[#^note-27b|youth]]. ^verse-27

**28**  He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. ^verse-28

**29**  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. ^verse-29

**30**  He giveth his [[#^note-30a|cheek]] to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with [[#^note-30b|reproach]]. ^verse-30

**31**  For the Lord will not cast off for ever: ^verse-31

**32**  But though he cause grief, yet will he have [[#^note-32a|compassion]] according to the multitude of his mercies. ^verse-32

**33**  For he doth not [[#^note-33a|afflict]] willingly nor grieve the children of men. ^verse-33

**34**  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, ^verse-34

**35**  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, ^verse-35

**36**  To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. ^verse-36

**37**  ¶ Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? ^verse-37

**38**  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? ^verse-38

**39**  Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? ^verse-39

**40**  Let us [[#^note-40a|search]] and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. ^verse-40

**41**  Let us [[#^note-41a|lift up]] our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. ^verse-41

**42**  We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. ^verse-42

**43**  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast [[#^note-43a|slain]], thou hast not pitied. ^verse-43

**44**  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. ^verse-44

**45**  Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. ^verse-45

**46**  All our [[#^note-46a|enemies]] have opened their mouths against us. ^verse-46

**47**  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. ^verse-47

**48**  Mine eye runneth down with [[#^note-48a|rivers]] of water for the [[#^note-48b|destruction]] of the daughter of my people. ^verse-48

**49**  Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, ^verse-49

**50**  Till the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. ^verse-50

**51**  Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. ^verse-51

**52**  Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. ^verse-52

**53**  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. ^verse-53

**54**  Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. ^verse-54

**55**  ¶ I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. ^verse-55

**56**  Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. ^verse-56

**57**  Thou [[#^note-57a|drewest]] near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. ^verse-57

**58**  O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. ^verse-58

**59**  O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. ^verse-59

**60**  Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. ^verse-60

**61**  Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, and all their imaginations against me; ^verse-61

**62**  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their [[#^note-62a|device]] against me all the day. ^verse-62

**63**  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. ^verse-63

**64**  ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O Lord, according to the work of their hands. ^verse-64

**65**  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. ^verse-65

**66**  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord. ^verse-66
