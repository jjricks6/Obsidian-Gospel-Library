*The condition of Zion is pitiful because of sin and iniquity.*

**1**  How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. ^verse-1

**2**  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! ^verse-2

**3**  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become [[#^note-3a|cruel]], like the ostriches in the wilderness. ^verse-3

**4**  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask [[#^note-4a|bread]], and no man breaketh it unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. ^verse-5

**6**  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. ^verse-6

**7**  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: ^verse-7

**8**  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. ^verse-8

**9**  They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. ^verse-9

**10**  The hands of the pitiful [[#^note-10a|women]] have [[#^note-10b|sodden]] their own children: they were their [[#^note-10c|meat]] in the destruction of the daughter of my people. ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. ^verse-11

**12**  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ For the [[#^note-13a|sins]] of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the [[#^note-13b|just]] in the midst of her, ^verse-13

**14**  They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. ^verse-14

**15**  They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. ^verse-15

**16**  The anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the [[#^note-16a|elders]]. ^verse-16

**17**  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a [[#^note-17a|nation]] that could not save us. ^verse-17

**18**  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our [[#^note-18a|end]] is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. ^verse-18

**19**  Our persecutors are [[#^note-19a|swifter]] than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. ^verse-19

**20**  The breath of our nostrils, the [[#^note-20a|anointed]] of the Lord, was taken in their [[#^note-20b|pits]], of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of [[#^note-21a|Edom]], that dwellest in the land of [[#^note-21b|Uz]]; the [[#^note-21c|cup]] also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins. ^verse-22
