### Psalm 10

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 11|Next Entry]]

*David speaks of various acts of the wicked—God is not in their thoughts—But the Lord is King forever and ever—He will judge the fatherless and oppressed.*

**1**  Why standest thou [[#^note-1a|afar]] off, O Lord? why [[#^note-1b|hidest]] thou thyself in times of trouble? ^verse-1

**2**  The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. ^verse-2

**3**  For the wicked [[#^note-3a|boasteth]] of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. ^verse-3

**4**  The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after [[#^note-4a|God]]: God is [[#^note-4b|not]] in all his thoughts. ^verse-4

**5**  His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. ^verse-5

**6**  He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. ^verse-6

**7**  His mouth is full of [[#^note-7a|cursing]] and deceit and [[#^note-7b|fraud]]: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. ^verse-7

**8**  He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. ^verse-8

**9**  He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. ^verse-9

**10**  He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. ^verse-10

**11**  He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. ^verse-11

**12**  Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the [[#^note-12a|humble]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the [[#^note-14a|fatherless]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Break thou the [[#^note-15a|arm]] of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. ^verse-15

**16**  The Lord is [[#^note-16a|King]] for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. ^verse-16

**17**  Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: ^verse-17

**18**  To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. ^verse-18
