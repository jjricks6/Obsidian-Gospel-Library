[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 10|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—He praises the Lord for rebuking the nations—The Lord will judge the world in righteousness—He will dwell in Zion—The wicked will be sent to hell.*

**1**  I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy [[#^note-1a|marvellous]] works. ^verse-1

**2**  I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. ^verse-2

**3**  When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast [[#^note-5a|put out]] their name for ever and ever. ^verse-5

**6**  O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. ^verse-6

**7**  But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for [[#^note-7a|judgment]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And he shall [[#^note-8a|judge]] the world in [[#^note-8b|righteousness]], he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord also will be a [[#^note-9a|refuge]] for the [[#^note-9b|oppressed]], a refuge in times of trouble. ^verse-9

**10**  And they that know thy [[#^note-10a|name]] will put their [[#^note-10b|trust]] in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. ^verse-10

**11**  Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: [[#^note-11a|declare]] among the people his doings. ^verse-11

**12**  When he [[#^note-12a|maketh]] [[#^note-12b|inquisition]] for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the [[#^note-12c|humble]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: ^verse-13

**14**  That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy [[#^note-14a|salvation]]. ^verse-14

**15**  The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the [[#^note-15a|net]] which they hid is their own foot taken. ^verse-15

**16**  The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is [[#^note-16a|snared]] in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. ^verse-16

**17**  The wicked shall be turned into [[#^note-17a|hell]], and all the nations that [[#^note-17b|forget]] God. ^verse-17

**18**  For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. ^verse-18

**19**  Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. ^verse-19

**20**  Put them in fear, O Lord: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. ^verse-20
