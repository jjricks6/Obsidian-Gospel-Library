*David sings of mercy and justiceâ€”He will forsake the company of evildoers.*

**1**  I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing. ^verse-1

**2**  I will behave myself [[#^note-2a|wisely]] in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. ^verse-2

**3**  I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. ^verse-3

**4**  A [[#^note-4a|froward]] heart shall depart from me: I will not [[#^note-4b|know]] a wicked person. ^verse-4

**5**  Whoso privily [[#^note-5a|slandereth]] his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I [[#^note-5b|suffer]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that [[#^note-6a|walketh]] in a [[#^note-6b|perfect]] way, he shall serve me. ^verse-6

**7**  He that worketh [[#^note-7a|deceit]] shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth [[#^note-7b|lies]] shall not tarry in my sight. ^verse-7

**8**  I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord. ^verse-8
