### Psalm 95

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 94|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 96|Next Entry]]

*Let us sing unto the Lord—Let us worship and bow down before Him—Israel provoked the Lord and failed to enter into His rest.*

**1**  O come, let us [[#^note-1a|sing]] unto the Lord: let us make a [[#^note-1b|joyful]] noise to the [[#^note-1c|rock]] of our salvation. ^verse-1

**2**  Let us come before his presence with [[#^note-2a|thanksgiving]], and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. ^verse-2

**3**  For the Lord is a [[#^note-3a|great]] God, and a great [[#^note-3b|King]] above all gods. ^verse-3

**4**  In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. ^verse-4

**5**  The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. ^verse-5

**6**  O come, let us [[#^note-6a|worship]] and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our [[#^note-6b|maker]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the [[#^note-7a|sheep]] of his hand. [[#^note-7b|To day]] if ye will [[#^note-7c|hear]] his [[#^note-7d|voice]], ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Harden]] not your heart, as [[#^note-8b|in]] the [[#^note-8c|provocation]], and as in the day of [[#^note-8d|temptation]] in the wilderness: ^verse-8

**9**  When your fathers tempted me, [[#^note-9a|proved]] me, and saw my work. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Forty]] years long was I [[#^note-10b|grieved]] with this [[#^note-10c|generation]], and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: ^verse-10

**11**  Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not [[#^note-11a|enter]] into my [[#^note-11b|rest]]. ^verse-11
