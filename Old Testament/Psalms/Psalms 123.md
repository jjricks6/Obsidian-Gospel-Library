*Lift up your eyes unto the Lord, and plead with Him for mercy.*

**1**  Unto thee [[#^note-1a|lift]] I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us. ^verse-2

**3**  Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. ^verse-3

**4**  Our soul is exceedingly filled with the [[#^note-4a|scorning]] of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. ^verse-4
