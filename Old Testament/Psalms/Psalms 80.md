*To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim-Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph.*

### Psalm 80

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 79|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 81|Next Entry]]

*Israel pleads with the Shepherd of Israel for deliverance, for salvation, and for His face to shine upon them.*

**1**  Give ear, O [[#^note-1a|Shepherd]] of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the [[#^note-1b|cherubims]], shine forth. ^verse-1

**2**  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Turn]] us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^verse-3

**4**  O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? ^verse-4

**5**  Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou makest us a [[#^note-6a|strife]] unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. ^verse-6

**7**  Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou hast brought a [[#^note-8a|vine]] out of [[#^note-8b|Egypt]]: thou hast [[#^note-8c|cast out]] the heathen, and planted it. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. ^verse-9

**10**  The hills were [[#^note-10a|covered]] with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. ^verse-10

**11**  She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. ^verse-11

**12**  Why hast thou then [[#^note-12a|broken]] down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? ^verse-12

**13**  The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. ^verse-13

**14**  Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; ^verse-14

**15**  And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. ^verse-15

**16**  It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. ^verse-16

**17**  Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. ^verse-17

**18**  So will not we [[#^note-18a|go back]] from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Turn]] us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^verse-19
