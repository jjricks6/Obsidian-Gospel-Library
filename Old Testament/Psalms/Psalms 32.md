*A Psalm of David, Maschil.*

### Psalm 32

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 31|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 33|Next Entry]]

*David says, Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity—David acknowledges his sin—He recommends that the righteous be glad in the Lord and rejoice.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Blessed]] is he whose [[#^note-1b|transgression]] is [[#^note-1c|forgiven]], whose sin is covered. ^verse-1

**2**  Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no [[#^note-2a|guile]]. ^verse-2

**3**  When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. ^verse-3

**4**  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my [[#^note-4a|moisture is turned into]] the drought of summer. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will [[#^note-5a|confess]] my [[#^note-5b|transgressions]] unto the Lord; and thou [[#^note-5c|forgavest]] the iniquity of my sin. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  For this shall every one that is [[#^note-6a|godly]] pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou art my [[#^note-7a|hiding place]]; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  I will instruct thee and [[#^note-8a|teach]] thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. ^verse-8

**9**  Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. ^verse-9

**10**  Many [[#^note-10a|sorrows]] shall be to the wicked: but he that [[#^note-10b|trusteth]] in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. ^verse-10

**11**  Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. ^verse-11
