*Gracious is the Lord, and righteousâ€”Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints.*

**1**  I [[#^note-1a|love]] the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. ^verse-1

**2**  Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. ^verse-2

**3**  The sorrows of death compassed me, and the [[#^note-3a|pains]] of [[#^note-3b|hell]] gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. ^verse-3

**4**  Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. ^verse-4

**5**  Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is [[#^note-5a|merciful]]. ^verse-5

**6**  The Lord preserveth the [[#^note-6a|simple]]: I was brought low, and he helped me. ^verse-6

**7**  Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. ^verse-7

**8**  For thou hast [[#^note-8a|delivered]] my [[#^note-8b|soul]] from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. ^verse-8

**9**  I will walk before the Lord in the [[#^note-9a|land]] of the living. ^verse-9

**10**  I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: ^verse-10

**11**  I said in my [[#^note-11a|haste]], All men are liars. ^verse-11

**12**  What shall I [[#^note-12a|render]] unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? ^verse-12

**13**  I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. ^verse-13

**14**  I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people. ^verse-14

**15**  Precious in the sight of the Lord is the [[#^note-15a|death]] of his saints. ^verse-15

**16**  O Lord, truly I am thy [[#^note-16a|servant]]; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. ^verse-16

**17**  I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will [[#^note-17a|call]] upon the name of the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people, ^verse-18

**19**  In the [[#^note-19a|courts]] of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. ^verse-19
