### Psalm 15

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 16|Next Entry]]

*David asks, Who will dwell in the Lord's holy hill?â€”He answers, The righteous, the upright, and those with integrity.*

**1**  Lord, who shall [[#^note-1a|abide]] in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy [[#^note-1b|hill]]? ^verse-1

**2**  He that [[#^note-2a|walketh]] uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. ^verse-2

**3**  He that [[#^note-3a|backbiteth]] not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his [[#^note-3b|neighbour]], nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. ^verse-3

**4**  In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. ^verse-4

**5**  He that putteth not out his money to [[#^note-5a|usury]], nor taketh [[#^note-5b|reward]] against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. ^verse-5
