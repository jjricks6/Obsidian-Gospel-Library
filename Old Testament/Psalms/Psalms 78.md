*Maschil of Asaph.*

### Psalm 78

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 77|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 79|Next Entry]]

*The Israelites are to teach the Lord's law to their children—Disobedient Israel provoked the Lord in the wilderness—The Egyptian plagues are recounted—The Lord chooses and blesses Judah and David.*

**1**  Give [[#^note-1a|ear]], O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. ^verse-1

**2**  I will open my mouth in a [[#^note-2a|parable]]: I will utter dark sayings of old: ^verse-2

**3**  Which we have heard and known, and our [[#^note-3a|fathers]] have told us. ^verse-3

**4**  We will not [[#^note-4a|hide]] them from their children, [[#^note-4b|shewing]] to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. ^verse-4

**5**  For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their [[#^note-5a|children]]: ^verse-5

**6**  That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: ^verse-6

**7**  That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: ^verse-7

**8**  And might not be as their [[#^note-8a|fathers]], a [[#^note-8b|stubborn]] and [[#^note-8c|rebellious]] generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. ^verse-8

**9**  The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. ^verse-9

**10**  They kept not the [[#^note-10a|covenant]] of God, and refused to walk in his law; ^verse-10

**11**  And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Marvellous]] things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of [[#^note-12b|Zoan]]. ^verse-12

**13**  He [[#^note-13a|divided]] the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. ^verse-13

**14**  In the daytime also he led them with a [[#^note-14a|cloud]], and all the night with a light of fire. ^verse-14

**15**  He [[#^note-15a|clave]] the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. ^verse-15

**16**  He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. ^verse-16

**17**  And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. ^verse-17

**18**  And they tempted God in their heart by asking [[#^note-18a|meat]] for their [[#^note-18b|lust]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a [[#^note-19a|table]] in the wilderness? ^verse-19

**20**  Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a [[#^note-21a|fire]] was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; ^verse-21

**22**  Because they [[#^note-22a|believed not]] in God, and [[#^note-22b|trusted]] not in his salvation: ^verse-22

**23**  Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, ^verse-23

**24**  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the [[#^note-24a|corn]] of heaven. ^verse-24

**25**  Man did eat [[#^note-25a|angels']] food: he sent them meat to the full. ^verse-25

**26**  He caused an [[#^note-26a|east wind]] to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. ^verse-26

**27**  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered [[#^note-27a|fowls]] like as the sand of the sea: ^verse-27

**28**  And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. ^verse-28

**29**  So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; ^verse-29

**30**  They were not estranged from their [[#^note-30a|lust]]. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, ^verse-30

**31**  The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. ^verse-31

**32**  For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. ^verse-32

**33**  Therefore their days did he consume in [[#^note-33a|vanity]], and their years in trouble. ^verse-33

**34**  When he [[#^note-34a|slew]] them, then they sought him: and they [[#^note-34b|returned]] and [[#^note-34c|inquired early]] after God. ^verse-34

**35**  And they remembered that God was their [[#^note-35a|rock]], and the high God their redeemer. ^verse-35

**36**  Nevertheless they did [[#^note-36a|flatter]] him with their mouth, and they [[#^note-36b|lied]] unto him with their tongues. ^verse-36

**37**  For their [[#^note-37a|heart]] was not right with him, neither were they [[#^note-37b|steadfast]] in his covenant. ^verse-37

**38**  But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. ^verse-38

**39**  For he remembered that they were but [[#^note-39a|flesh]]; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. ^verse-39

**40**  How oft did they [[#^note-40a|provoke]] him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! ^verse-40

**41**  Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. ^verse-41

**42**  They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. ^verse-42

**43**  How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: ^verse-43

**44**  And had turned their rivers into blood; and their [[#^note-44a|floods]], that they could not drink. ^verse-44

**45**  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. ^verse-45

**46**  He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the [[#^note-46a|locust]]. ^verse-46

**47**  He destroyed their vines with [[#^note-47a|hail]], and their sycomore trees with frost. ^verse-47

**48**  He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. ^verse-48

**49**  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending [[#^note-49a|evil angels]] among them. ^verse-49

**50**  He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; ^verse-50

**51**  And smote all the [[#^note-51a|firstborn]] in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the [[#^note-51b|tabernacles]] of [[#^note-51c|Ham]]: ^verse-51

**52**  But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. ^verse-52

**53**  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the [[#^note-53a|sea]] overwhelmed their enemies. ^verse-53

**54**  And he brought them [[#^note-54a|to]] the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. ^verse-54

**55**  He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. ^verse-55

**56**  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: ^verse-56

**57**  But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a [[#^note-57a|deceitful]] bow. ^verse-57

**58**  For they [[#^note-58a|provoked]] him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. ^verse-58

**59**  When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: ^verse-59

**60**  So that he forsook the tabernacle of [[#^note-60a|Shiloh]], the tent which he placed among men; ^verse-60

**61**  And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. ^verse-61

**62**  He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. ^verse-62

**63**  The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. ^verse-63

**64**  Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. ^verse-64

**65**  Then the Lord [[#^note-65a|awaked]] as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. ^verse-65

**66**  And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. ^verse-66

**67**  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: ^verse-67

**68**  But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. ^verse-68

**69**  And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for [[#^note-69a|ever]]. ^verse-69

**70**  He chose [[#^note-70a|David]] also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: ^verse-70

**71**  From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. ^verse-71

**72**  So he fed them according to the [[#^note-72a|integrity]] of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. ^verse-72
