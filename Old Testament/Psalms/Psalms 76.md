**6**  At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may [[#^note-7a|stand]] in thy sight when once thou art angry? ^verse-7

**10**  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou [[#^note-10a|restrain]]. ^verse-10
