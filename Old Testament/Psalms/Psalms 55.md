### Psalm 55

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 54|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 56|Next Entry]]

*David prays morning, noon, and nightâ€”He seeks protection and help against his enemies.*

**1**  Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. ^verse-1

**2**  Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and [[#^note-2a|make a noise]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. ^verse-3

**4**  My heart is sore [[#^note-4a|pained]] within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. ^verse-4

**5**  Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. ^verse-5

**6**  And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. ^verse-6

**7**  Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. ^verse-8

**9**  Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and [[#^note-9a|strife]] in the city. ^verse-9

**10**  Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. ^verse-10

**11**  Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and [[#^note-11a|guile]] depart not from her streets. ^verse-11

**12**  For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: ^verse-12

**13**  But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. ^verse-13

**14**  We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in [[#^note-14a|company]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into [[#^note-15a|hell]]: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. ^verse-15

**16**  As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me. ^verse-16

**17**  Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I [[#^note-17a|pray]], and cry aloud: and he shall [[#^note-17b|hear]] my voice. ^verse-17

**18**  He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. ^verse-18

**19**  God shall hear, and [[#^note-19a|afflict]] them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no [[#^note-19b|changes]], therefore they fear not God. ^verse-19

**20**  He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. ^verse-20

**21**  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Cast]] thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the [[#^note-22b|righteous]] to be moved. ^verse-22

**23**  But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. ^verse-23
