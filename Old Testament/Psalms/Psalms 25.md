[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 24|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 26|Next Entry]]

*David pleads for truth and asks for pardon—Mercy and truth are for those who keep the commandments.*

**1**  Unto thee, O Lord, do I [[#^note-1a|lift up]] my soul. ^verse-1

**2**  O my God, I [[#^note-2a|trust]] in thee: let me not be [[#^note-2b|ashamed]], let not mine enemies triumph over me. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, let none that wait on thee be [[#^note-3a|ashamed]]: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. ^verse-3

**4**  Shew me thy [[#^note-4a|ways]], O Lord; teach me thy paths. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Lead]] me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I [[#^note-5b|wait]] all the day. ^verse-5

**6**  Remember, O Lord, thy tender [[#^note-6a|mercies]] and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. ^verse-6

**7**  Remember not the [[#^note-7a|sins]] of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy [[#^note-7b|mercy]] remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he [[#^note-8a|teach]] sinners in the way. ^verse-8

**9**  The meek will he [[#^note-9a|guide]] in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. ^verse-9

**10**  All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. ^verse-10

**11**  For thy [[#^note-11a|name's]] sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. ^verse-11

**12**  What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. ^verse-12

**13**  His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the [[#^note-13a|earth]]. ^verse-13

**14**  The [[#^note-14a|secret]] of the Lord is with them that [[#^note-14b|fear]] him; and he will shew them his covenant. ^verse-14

**15**  Mine [[#^note-15a|eyes]] are ever toward the Lord; for he shall pluck my feet out of the [[#^note-15b|net]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Turn thee unto me, and have [[#^note-16a|mercy]] upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted. ^verse-16

**17**  The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. ^verse-17

**18**  Look upon mine affliction and my [[#^note-18a|pain]]; and forgive all my sins. ^verse-18

**19**  Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with [[#^note-19a|cruel]] hatred. ^verse-19

**20**  O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be [[#^note-20a|ashamed]]; for I put my [[#^note-20b|trust]] in thee. ^verse-20

**21**  Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Redeem]] Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. ^verse-22
