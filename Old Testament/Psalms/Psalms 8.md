[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 9|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—He says that babes and children praise the Lord—He asks, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?*

**1**  O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. ^verse-1

**2**  Out of the mouth of [[#^note-2a|babes]] and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. ^verse-2

**3**  When I [[#^note-3a|consider]] thy [[#^note-3b|heavens]], the [[#^note-3c|work]] of thy fingers, the [[#^note-3d|moon]] and the stars, which thou hast ordained; ^verse-3

**4**  What is [[#^note-4a|man]], that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou [[#^note-4b|visitest]] him? ^verse-4

**5**  For thou hast made him a little [[#^note-5a|lower]] than the [[#^note-5b|angels]], and hast crowned him with glory and honour. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou madest him to have [[#^note-6a|dominion]] over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: ^verse-6

**7**  All [[#^note-7a|sheep]] and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; ^verse-7

**8**  The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. ^verse-8

**9**  O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! ^verse-9
