[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 55|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 57|Next Entry]]

*David seeks mercy, trusts in and praises the Lord, and thanks Him for deliverance.*

**1**  Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would [[#^note-1a|swallow]] me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. ^verse-1

**2**  Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. ^verse-2

**3**  What time I am afraid, I will [[#^note-3a|trust]] in thee. ^verse-3

**4**  In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my [[#^note-4a|trust]]; I will not [[#^note-4b|fear]] what flesh can do unto me. ^verse-4

**5**  Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. ^verse-5

**6**  They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they [[#^note-6a|wait for my soul]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy [[#^note-8a|book]]? ^verse-8

**9**  When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. ^verse-9

**10**  In God will I praise his word: in the Lord will I praise his word. ^verse-10

**11**  In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. ^verse-11

**12**  Thy [[#^note-12a|vows]] are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. ^verse-12

**13**  For thou hast delivered my [[#^note-13a|soul]] from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may [[#^note-13b|walk]] before God in the light of the living? ^verse-13
