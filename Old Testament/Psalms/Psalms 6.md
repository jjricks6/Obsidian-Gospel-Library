[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 7|Next Entry]]

*David cries unto the Lord for mercyâ€”He asks to be healed and saved.*

**1**  O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^verse-1

**2**  Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am [[#^note-2a|weak]]: O Lord, [[#^note-2b|heal]] me; for my bones are vexed. ^verse-2

**3**  My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? ^verse-3

**4**  Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. ^verse-4

**5**  For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the [[#^note-5a|grave]] who shall give thee thanks? ^verse-5

**6**  I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my [[#^note-6a|tears]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. ^verse-7

**8**  Depart from me, all ye workers of [[#^note-8a|iniquity]]; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. ^verse-9

**10**  Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly. ^verse-10
