### Psalm 84

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 83|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 85|Next Entry]]

*The righteous cry unto the living God—It is better to be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord than to dwell in the tents of wickedness—No good thing is withheld from those who walk uprightly.*

**1**  How [[#^note-1a|amiable are thy tabernacles]], O Lord of hosts! ^verse-1

**2**  My soul longeth, yea, even [[#^note-2a|fainteth]] for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. ^verse-3

**4**  Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  Blessed is the man whose [[#^note-5a|strength]] is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. ^verse-5

**6**  Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. ^verse-6

**7**  They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion [[#^note-7a|appeareth]] before God. ^verse-7

**8**  O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. ^verse-9

**10**  For a day in thy courts is better than [[#^note-10a|a thousand]]. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. ^verse-10

**11**  For the Lord God is a [[#^note-11a|sun]] and [[#^note-11b|shield]]: the Lord will give [[#^note-11c|grace]] and glory: no good thing will he [[#^note-11d|withhold]] from them that [[#^note-11e|walk]] uprightly. ^verse-11

**12**  O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. ^verse-12
