*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David the servant of the Lord.*

### Psalm 36

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 35|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 37|Next Entry]]

*David praises the Lord for His mercy, His righteousness, and His loving kindness—The fountain of life is with the Lord.*

**1**  The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no [[#^note-1a|fear]] of God before his eyes. ^verse-1

**2**  For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. ^verse-2

**3**  The words of his mouth are iniquity and [[#^note-3a|deceit]]: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good. ^verse-3

**4**  He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. ^verse-4

**5**  Thy [[#^note-5a|mercy]], O Lord, is in the [[#^note-5b|heavens]]; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. ^verse-5

**6**  Thy [[#^note-6a|righteousness]] is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O Lord, thou preservest man and beast. ^verse-6

**7**  How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their [[#^note-7a|trust]] under the shadow of thy wings. ^verse-7

**8**  They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy [[#^note-8a|pleasures]]. ^verse-8

**9**  For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy [[#^note-9a|light]] shall we see light. ^verse-9

**10**  O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. ^verse-10

**11**  Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. ^verse-11

**12**  There are the workers of [[#^note-12a|iniquity]] fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. ^verse-12
