*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 11

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 10|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 12|Next Entry]]

*David rejoices that the Lord is in His holy templeâ€”The Lord tests the righteous and hates the wicked.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|In]] the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? ^verse-1

**2**  For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily [[#^note-2a|shoot]] at the upright in heart. ^verse-2

**3**  If the [[#^note-3a|foundations]] be destroyed, what can the righteous do? ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's [[#^note-4a|throne]] is in [[#^note-4b|heaven]]: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord [[#^note-5a|trieth]] the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. ^verse-5

**6**  Upon the [[#^note-6a|wicked]] he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. ^verse-6

**7**  For the righteous Lord loveth [[#^note-7a|righteousness]]; [[#^note-7b|his]] countenance doth behold the upright. ^verse-7
