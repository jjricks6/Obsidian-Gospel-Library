### Psalm 104

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 103|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 105|Next Entry]]

*The Lord is clothed with honor and majesty—He makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flaming fire—Through His providence He sustains all forms of life—His glory endures forever.*

**1**  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art [[#^note-1a|clothed]] with honour and majesty. ^verse-1

**2**  Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who [[#^note-2a|stretchest]] out the [[#^note-2b|heavens]] like a curtain: ^verse-2

**3**  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the [[#^note-3a|clouds]] his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: ^verse-3

**4**  Who maketh [[#^note-4a|his angels spirits]]; his ministers a flaming fire: ^verse-4

**5**  Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the [[#^note-6a|waters]] stood above the mountains. ^verse-6

**7**  At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. ^verse-7

**8**  They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to [[#^note-9a|cover]] the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  He sendeth the [[#^note-10a|springs]] into the valleys, which run among the hills. ^verse-10

**11**  They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. ^verse-11

**12**  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. ^verse-12

**13**  He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. ^verse-13

**14**  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; ^verse-14

**15**  And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|trees]] of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; ^verse-16

**17**  Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. ^verse-17

**18**  The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the [[#^note-18a|conies]]. ^verse-18

**19**  He appointed the [[#^note-19a|moon]] [[#^note-19b|for seasons]]: the sun knoweth his going down. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. ^verse-20

**21**  The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. ^verse-21

**22**  The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. ^verse-22

**23**  Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. ^verse-23

**24**  O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy [[#^note-24a|riches]]. ^verse-24

**25**  So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. ^verse-25

**26**  There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. ^verse-26

**27**  These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. ^verse-27

**28**  That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. ^verse-28

**29**  Thou hidest thy [[#^note-29a|face]], they are troubled: thou takest away their [[#^note-29b|breath]], they die, and return to their [[#^note-29c|dust]]. ^verse-29

**30**  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. ^verse-30

**31**  The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works. ^verse-31

**32**  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. ^verse-32

**33**  I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. ^verse-33

**34**  My [[#^note-34a|meditation]] of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord. ^verse-34

**35**  Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. [[#^note-35a|Praise ye the Lord]]. ^verse-35
