*A messianic psalm—The Lord will deliver the Messiah from terror, pestilence, and war—The Lord will give His angels charge over the Messiah and deliver Him and honor Him.*

**1**  He that dwelleth in the [[#^note-1a|secret]] place of the most High shall abide under the [[#^note-1b|shadow]] of the Almighty. ^verse-1

**2**  I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I [[#^note-2a|trust]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Surely he shall deliver thee from the [[#^note-3a|snare]] of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. ^verse-3

**4**  He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy [[#^note-4a|shield]] and [[#^note-4b|buckler]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou shalt not be afraid for the [[#^note-5a|terror]] by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; ^verse-5

**6**  Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the [[#^note-6a|destruction]] that wasteth at noonday. ^verse-6

**7**  A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. ^verse-7

**8**  Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the [[#^note-8a|wicked]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; ^verse-9

**10**  There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. ^verse-10

**11**  For he shall give his [[#^note-11a|angels]] charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. ^verse-11

**12**  They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou shalt [[#^note-13a|tread]] upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the [[#^note-13b|dragon]] shalt thou trample under feet. ^verse-13

**14**  Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. ^verse-14

**15**  He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. ^verse-15

**16**  With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. ^verse-16
