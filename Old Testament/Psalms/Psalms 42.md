[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 41|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 43|Next Entry]]

*The souls of the righteous thirst for Godâ€”The wicked say, Where is your God?*

**1**  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. ^verse-1

**2**  My soul [[#^note-2a|thirsteth]] for God, for the [[#^note-2b|living God]]: when shall I come and appear before God? ^verse-2

**3**  My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? ^verse-3

**4**  When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. ^verse-4

**5**  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. ^verse-5

**6**  O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. ^verse-6

**7**  Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. ^verse-7

**8**  Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the [[#^note-8a|night]] his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. ^verse-8

**9**  I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? ^verse-9

**10**  As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? ^verse-10

**11**  Why art thou [[#^note-11a|cast down]], O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? [[#^note-11b|hope]] thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. ^verse-11
