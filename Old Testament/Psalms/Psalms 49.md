*To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.*

### Psalm 49

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 48|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 50|Next Entry]]

*Men cannot be ransomed or redeemed by wealth—God alone can redeem a soul from the grave—The glory of a rich man ceases with his death.*

**1**  H[[#^note-1a|ear]] this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: ^verse-1

**2**  Both low and high, rich and poor, together. ^verse-2

**3**  My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. ^verse-3

**4**  I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will [[#^note-4a|open]] my dark saying upon the harp. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my [[#^note-5a|heels]] shall compass me about? ^verse-5

**6**  They that trust in their [[#^note-6a|wealth]], and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; ^verse-6

**7**  None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: ^verse-7

**8**  (For the redemption of their [[#^note-8a|soul]] is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) ^verse-8

**9**  That he should still [[#^note-9a|live]] for ever, and not see corruption. ^verse-9

**10**  For he seeth that wise men [[#^note-10a|die]], likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. ^verse-10

**11**  Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own [[#^note-11a|names]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. ^verse-12

**13**  This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. ^verse-13

**14**  Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have [[#^note-14a|dominion]] over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. ^verse-14

**15**  But God will [[#^note-15a|redeem]] my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall [[#^note-15b|receive]] me. Selah. ^verse-15

**16**  Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; ^verse-16

**17**  For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. ^verse-17

**18**  Though while he lived he [[#^note-18a|blessed]] his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. ^verse-18

**19**  He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. ^verse-19

**20**  Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. ^verse-20
