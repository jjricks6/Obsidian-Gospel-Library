[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 45|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 47|Next Entry]]

*God is our refuge and strengthâ€”He dwells in His city, does marvelous things, and says, Be still and know that I am God.*

**1**  God is our [[#^note-1a|refuge]] and strength, a very present help in trouble. ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; ^verse-2

**3**  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. ^verse-3

**4**  There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. ^verse-4

**5**  God is in the [[#^note-5a|midst]] of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. ^verse-5

**6**  The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|Lord of hosts]] is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. ^verse-8

**9**  He maketh [[#^note-9a|wars]] to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. ^verse-9

**10**  Be [[#^note-10a|still]], and [[#^note-10b|know]] that I am God: I will be [[#^note-10c|exalted]] among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. ^verse-11
