### Psalm 64

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 63|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 65|Next Entry]]

*David prays for safetyâ€”The righteous will be glad in heart.*

**1**  Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. ^verse-1

**2**  Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: ^verse-2

**3**  Who whet their [[#^note-3a|tongue]] like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even [[#^note-3b|bitter]] words: ^verse-3

**4**  That they may [[#^note-4a|shoot]] in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. ^verse-4

**5**  They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares [[#^note-5a|privily]]; they say, Who shall [[#^note-5b|see]] them? ^verse-5

**6**  They search out [[#^note-6a|iniquities]]; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. ^verse-6

**7**  But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. ^verse-7

**8**  So they shall make their own tongue to [[#^note-8a|fall]] upon themselves: all that see them shall [[#^note-8b|flee]] away. ^verse-8

**9**  And all men shall fear, and shall declare the [[#^note-9a|work]] of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. ^verse-9

**10**  The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall [[#^note-10a|trust]] in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. ^verse-10
