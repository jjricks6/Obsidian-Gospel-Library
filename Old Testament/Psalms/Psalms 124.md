*David says, Israel's help is in the name of the Lord.*

**1**  If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say; ^verse-1

**2**  If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us: ^verse-2

**3**  Then they had [[#^note-3a|swallowed]] us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: ^verse-3

**4**  Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: ^verse-4

**5**  Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. ^verse-5

**6**  Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. ^verse-6

**7**  Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the [[#^note-7a|snare]] of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. ^verse-7

**8**  Our [[#^note-8a|help]] is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. ^verse-8
