*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.*

### Psalm 51

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 50|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 52|Next Entry]]

*David pleads for forgiveness after he went in to Bathshebaâ€”He pleads, Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right spirit within me.*

**1**  Have [[#^note-1a|mercy]] upon me, O God, according to thy [[#^note-1b|lovingkindness]]: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies [[#^note-1c|blot out]] my [[#^note-1d|transgressions]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and [[#^note-2a|cleanse]] me from my sin. ^verse-2

**3**  For I [[#^note-3a|acknowledge]] my transgressions: and my [[#^note-3b|sin]] is ever before me. ^verse-3

**4**  Against thee, thee only, have I [[#^note-4a|sinned]], and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be [[#^note-4b|justified]] when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother [[#^note-5a|conceive]] me. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ^verse-6

**7**  Purge me with [[#^note-7a|hyssop]], and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. ^verse-7

**8**  Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. ^verse-8

**9**  Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. ^verse-9

**10**  Create in me a [[#^note-10a|clean]] heart, O God; and [[#^note-10b|renew]] a right spirit within me. ^verse-10

**11**  Cast me not away from thy [[#^note-11a|presence]]; and take not thy [[#^note-11b|holy spirit]] from me. ^verse-11

**12**  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. ^verse-12

**13**  Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be [[#^note-13a|converted]] unto thee. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Deliver]] me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. ^verse-14

**15**  O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. ^verse-15

**16**  For thou desirest not [[#^note-16a|sacrifice]]; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. ^verse-16

**17**  The [[#^note-17a|sacrifices]] of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a [[#^note-17b|contrite heart]], O God, thou wilt not despise. ^verse-17

**18**  Do good in thy good [[#^note-18a|pleasure]] unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. ^verse-18

**19**  Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. ^verse-19
