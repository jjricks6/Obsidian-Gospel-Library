[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 29|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 31|Next Entry]]

*David sings praises and gives thanks to the Lordâ€”David pleads for mercy.*

**1**  I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. ^verse-1

**2**  O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast [[#^note-2a|healed]] me. ^verse-2

**3**  O Lord, thou hast [[#^note-3a|brought up]] my [[#^note-3b|soul]] from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. ^verse-3

**4**  Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|For]] his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but [[#^note-5b|joy]] cometh in the morning. ^verse-5

**6**  And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. ^verse-6

**7**  Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy [[#^note-7a|face]], and I was troubled. ^verse-7

**8**  I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|What]] profit is there in my [[#^note-9b|blood]], when I go down to the pit? Shall the [[#^note-9c|dust]] praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? ^verse-9

**10**  Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou hast turned for me my [[#^note-11a|mourning]] into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with [[#^note-11b|gladness]]; ^verse-11

**12**  To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. ^verse-12
