[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 71|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 73|Next Entry]]

*David speaks of Solomon, who is made a type of the Messiah—He will have dominion—His name will endure forever—All nations will call him blessed—The whole earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord.*

**1**  Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son. ^verse-1

**2**  He shall [[#^note-2a|judge]] thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. ^verse-2

**3**  The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. ^verse-3

**4**  He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the [[#^note-4a|oppressor]]. ^verse-4

**5**  They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon [[#^note-5a|endure]], throughout all generations. ^verse-5

**6**  He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  In his days shall the [[#^note-7a|righteous]] flourish; and abundance of [[#^note-7b|peace]] so long as the moon endureth. ^verse-7

**8**  He shall have [[#^note-8a|dominion]] also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-8

**9**  They that dwell in the wilderness shall [[#^note-9a|bow]] before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. ^verse-9

**10**  The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall [[#^note-10a|bring presents]]: the kings of Sheba and [[#^note-10b|Seba]] shall offer gifts. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. ^verse-11

**12**  For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. ^verse-12

**13**  He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. ^verse-13

**14**  He shall [[#^note-14a|redeem]] their soul from deceit and violence: and [[#^note-14b|precious]] shall their blood be in his sight. ^verse-14

**15**  And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised. ^verse-15

**16**  There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like [[#^note-16a|grass]] of the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be [[#^note-17a|blessed]] in him: all nations shall call him blessed. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Blessed]] be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. ^verse-18

**19**  And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be [[#^note-19a|filled]] with his [[#^note-19b|glory]]; Amen, and Amen. ^verse-19

**20**  The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. ^verse-20
