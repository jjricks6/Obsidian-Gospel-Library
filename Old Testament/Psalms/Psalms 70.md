**3**  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. ^verse-3

**4**  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. ^verse-4

**5**  But I am poor and needy: make [[#^note-5a|haste]] unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying. ^verse-5
