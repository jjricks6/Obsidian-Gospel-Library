*A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.*

### Psalm 102

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 101|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 103|Next Entry]]

*The psalmist offers a prayer of the afflicted—Zion will be built up when the Lord appears in His glory—Though the heaven and earth perish, the Lord who created them will endure forever.*

**1**  Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Hide]] not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. ^verse-2

**3**  For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. ^verse-3

**4**  My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. ^verse-4

**5**  By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. ^verse-5

**6**  I am like a [[#^note-6a|pelican]] of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. ^verse-6

**7**  I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. ^verse-7

**8**  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. ^verse-8

**9**  For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, ^verse-9

**10**  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. ^verse-10

**11**  My days are like a [[#^note-11a|shadow]] that declineth; and I am withered like [[#^note-11b|grass]]. ^verse-11

**12**  But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for [[#^note-12a|ever]]; and thy remembrance unto all generations. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou shalt arise, and have [[#^note-13a|mercy]] upon [[#^note-13b|Zion]]: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. ^verse-13

**14**  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. ^verse-14

**15**  So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. ^verse-15

**16**  When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall [[#^note-16a|appear]] in his glory. ^verse-16

**17**  He will regard the [[#^note-17a|prayer]] of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. ^verse-17

**18**  This shall be [[#^note-18a|written]] for the [[#^note-18b|generation]] to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. ^verse-18

**19**  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; ^verse-19

**20**  To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; ^verse-20

**21**  To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; ^verse-21

**22**  When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. ^verse-23

**24**  I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. ^verse-24

**25**  Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the [[#^note-25a|earth]]: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. ^verse-25

**26**  They shall [[#^note-26a|perish]], but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: ^verse-26

**27**  But thou art the [[#^note-27a|same]], and thy years shall have no [[#^note-27b|end]]. ^verse-27

**28**  The children of thy servants shall continue, and their [[#^note-28a|seed]] shall be established before thee. ^verse-28
