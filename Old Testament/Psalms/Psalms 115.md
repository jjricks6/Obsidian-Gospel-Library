### Psalm 115

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 114|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 116|Next Entry]]

*Our God is in the heavens—Idols are false gods—Trust in the Lord.*

**1**  Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy [[#^note-1a|name]] give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? ^verse-2

**3**  But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. ^verse-3

**4**  Their [[#^note-4a|idols]] are silver and gold, the [[#^note-4b|work]] of men's hands. ^verse-4

**5**  They have mouths, but they [[#^note-5a|speak not]]: eyes have they, but they [[#^note-5b|see not]]: ^verse-5

**6**  They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: ^verse-6

**7**  They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. ^verse-7

**8**  They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. ^verse-8

**9**  O Israel, [[#^note-9a|trust]] thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. ^verse-9

**10**  O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. ^verse-10

**11**  Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. ^verse-11

**12**  The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. ^verse-12

**13**  He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great. ^verse-13

**14**  The Lord shall [[#^note-14a|increase]] you more and more, you and your children. ^verse-14

**15**  Ye are [[#^note-15a|blessed]] of the Lord which made heaven and earth. ^verse-15

**16**  The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. ^verse-16

**17**  The [[#^note-17a|dead]] praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence. ^verse-17

**18**  But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord. ^verse-18
