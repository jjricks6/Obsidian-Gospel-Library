[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 102|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 104|Next Entry]]

*David exhorts the Saints to bless the Lord for His mercyâ€”The Lord is merciful unto those who keep His commandments.*

**1**  Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. ^verse-1

**2**  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: ^verse-2

**3**  Who [[#^note-3a|forgiveth]] all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy [[#^note-3b|diseases]]; ^verse-3

**4**  Who [[#^note-4a|redeemeth]] thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; ^verse-4

**5**  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the [[#^note-5a|eagle's]]. ^verse-5

**6**  The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. ^verse-6

**7**  He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. ^verse-7

**8**  The [[#^note-8a|Lord]] is [[#^note-8b|merciful]] and gracious, slow to [[#^note-8c|anger]], and plenteous in mercy. ^verse-8

**9**  He will not always chide: neither will he keep his [[#^note-9a|anger]] for ever. ^verse-9

**10**  He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. ^verse-10

**11**  For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. ^verse-11

**12**  As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. ^verse-12

**13**  Like as a father [[#^note-13a|pitieth]] his [[#^note-13b|children]], so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. ^verse-13

**14**  For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are [[#^note-14a|dust]]. ^verse-14

**15**  As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. ^verse-15

**16**  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. ^verse-16

**17**  But the [[#^note-17a|mercy]] of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; ^verse-17

**18**  To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. ^verse-18

**19**  The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. ^verse-19

**20**  Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. ^verse-20

**21**  Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his [[#^note-21a|pleasure]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul. ^verse-22
