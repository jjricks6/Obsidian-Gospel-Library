*To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 22

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 21|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 23|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—He foretells events in the Messiah's life—The Messiah will say, My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?—They will pierce His hands and feet—He will yet govern among all nations.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|My]] God, my God, why hast thou [[#^note-1b|forsaken]] me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from [[#^note-1c|the]] words of my roaring? ^verse-1

**2**  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. ^verse-2

**3**  But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. ^verse-3

**4**  Our fathers [[#^note-4a|trusted]] in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. ^verse-4

**5**  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. ^verse-5

**6**  But I am a worm, and no man; a [[#^note-6a|reproach]] of men, and [[#^note-6b|despised]] of the people. ^verse-6

**7**  All they that see me laugh me to [[#^note-7a|scorn]]: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, ^verse-7

**8**  He [[#^note-8a|trusted]] on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. ^verse-8

**9**  But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. ^verse-9

**10**  I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. ^verse-10

**11**  Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. ^verse-11

**12**  Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. ^verse-12

**13**  They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. ^verse-13

**14**  I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my [[#^note-14a|heart]] is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. ^verse-14

**15**  My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. ^verse-15

**16**    For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the [[#^note-16a|wicked]] have inclosed me: they [[#^note-16b|pierced]] my hands and my feet. ^verse-16

**17**  I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. ^verse-17

**18**  They part my [[#^note-18a|garments]] among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. ^verse-18

**19**  But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, [[#^note-19a|haste]] thee to help me. ^verse-19

**20**  Deliver my soul from the sword; [[#^note-20a|my darling]] from the power of the dog. ^verse-20

**21**  Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the [[#^note-21a|unicorns]]. ^verse-21

**22**  I will declare thy [[#^note-22a|name]] unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. ^verse-22

**23**  Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. ^verse-23

**24**  For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. ^verse-24

**25**  My praise shall be of thee in the great [[#^note-25a|congregation]]: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. ^verse-25

**26**  The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. ^verse-26

**27**  All the ends of the [[#^note-27a|world]] shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. ^verse-27

**28**  For the [[#^note-28a|kingdom]] is the Lord's: and he is the [[#^note-28b|governor]] among the nations. ^verse-28

**29**  All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own [[#^note-29a|soul]]. ^verse-29

**30**  A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. ^verse-30

**31**  They shall come, and shall [[#^note-31a|declare]] his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this. ^verse-31
