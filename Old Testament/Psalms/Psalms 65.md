*David speaks of the blessedness of God's chosenâ€”The Lord sends rain and good things upon the earth.*

**1**  Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. ^verse-1

**2**  O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee sh[[#^note-2a|all]] all flesh [[#^note-2b|come]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt [[#^note-3a|purge]] them away. ^verse-3

**4**  Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy [[#^note-4a|courts]]: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. ^verse-4

**5**  By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: ^verse-5

**6**  Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power: ^verse-6

**7**  Which [[#^note-7a|stilleth]] the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. ^verse-7

**8**  They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy [[#^note-8a|tokens]]: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them [[#^note-9a|corn]], when thou hast so provided for it. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the [[#^note-10a|springing]] thereof. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. ^verse-11

**12**  They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. ^verse-12

**13**  The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. ^verse-13
