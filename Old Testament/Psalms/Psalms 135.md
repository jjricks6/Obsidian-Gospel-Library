*Praise and bless the Lordâ€”Our Lord is above all gods; idols cannot see, hear, or speak.*

**1**  Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, ^verse-2

**3**  Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. ^verse-3

**4**  For the Lord hath chosen [[#^note-4a|Jacob]] unto himself, and Israel for his [[#^note-4b|peculiar]] [[#^note-4c|treasure]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. ^verse-5

**6**  Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. ^verse-6

**7**  He causeth the [[#^note-7a|vapours to ascend]] from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. ^verse-7

**8**  Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. ^verse-8

**9**  Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. ^verse-9

**10**  Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Sihon]] king of the Amorites, and [[#^note-11b|Og]] king of Bashan, and all the [[#^note-11c|kingdoms]] of Canaan: ^verse-11

**12**  And gave their land for an [[#^note-12a|heritage]], an heritage unto Israel his people. ^verse-12

**13**  Thy [[#^note-13a|name]], O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. ^verse-13

**14**  For the Lord will judge his people, and he will [[#^note-14a|repent]] himself concerning his servants. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|idols]] of the [[#^note-15b|heathen]] are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. ^verse-15

**16**  They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; ^verse-16

**17**  They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. ^verse-17

**18**  They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. ^verse-18

**19**  Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron: ^verse-19

**20**  Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. ^verse-21
