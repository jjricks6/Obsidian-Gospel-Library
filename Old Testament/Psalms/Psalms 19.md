*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 19

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 18|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 20|Next Entry]]

*David testifies, The heavens declare the glory of God, the law of the Lord is perfect, and the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|heavens]] [[#^note-1b|declare]] the [[#^note-1c|glory]] of God; and the firmament sheweth his [[#^note-1d|handywork]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. ^verse-2

**3**  There is no speech nor [[#^note-3a|language]], where their voice is not heard. ^verse-3

**4**  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their [[#^note-4a|words]] to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, ^verse-4

**5**  Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. ^verse-5

**6**  His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|law]] of the Lord is [[#^note-7b|perfect]], [[#^note-7c|converting]] the soul: the [[#^note-7d|testimony]] of the Lord is [[#^note-7e|sure]], making [[#^note-7f|wise]] the [[#^note-7g|simple]]. ^verse-7

**8**  The statutes of the Lord are right, [[#^note-8a|rejoicing]] the heart: the commandment of the Lord is [[#^note-8b|pure]], [[#^note-8c|enlightening]] the eyes. ^verse-8

**9**  The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the [[#^note-9a|judgments]] of the Lord are [[#^note-9b|true]] and righteous altogether. ^verse-9

**10**  More to be [[#^note-10a|desired]] are they than [[#^note-10b|gold]], yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. ^verse-10

**11**  Moreover by them is thy servant [[#^note-11a|warned]]: and in [[#^note-11b|keeping]] of them there is great reward. ^verse-11

**12**  Who can understand his errors? [[#^note-12a|cleanse]] thou me from [[#^note-12b|secret]] faults. ^verse-12

**13**  Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous [[#^note-13a|sins]]; let them not have [[#^note-13b|dominion]] over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great [[#^note-13c|transgression]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Let the words of my mouth, and the [[#^note-14a|meditation]] of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my [[#^note-14b|strength]], and my redeemer. ^verse-14
