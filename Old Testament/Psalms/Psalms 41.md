[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 40|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 42|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—Blessed is he who considers the poor—The treachery of Judas is foretold.*

**1**  Blessed is he that considereth the [[#^note-1a|poor]]: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord will [[#^note-2a|preserve]] him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt [[#^note-3a|make]] all his bed in his [[#^note-3b|sickness]]. ^verse-3

**4**  I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: [[#^note-4a|heal]] my soul; for I have sinned against thee. ^verse-4

**5**  Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? ^verse-5

**6**  And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. ^verse-6

**7**  All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. ^verse-7

**8**  An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. ^verse-8

**9**  Yea, mine own familiar [[#^note-9a|friend]], in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his [[#^note-9b|heel]] against me. ^verse-9

**10**  But thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. ^verse-10

**11**  By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. ^verse-11

**12**  And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Blessed]] be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. ^verse-13
