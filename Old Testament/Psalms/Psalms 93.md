*The Lord reigns—He is from everlasting—Holiness adorns the house of the Lord forever.*

**1**  The Lord reigneth, he is [[#^note-1a|clothed]] with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. ^verse-1

**2**  Thy throne is established of old: thou art from [[#^note-2a|everlasting]]. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|floods]] have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. ^verse-4

**5**  Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever. ^verse-5
