### Psalm 141

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 140|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 142|Next Entry]]

*David pleads with the Lord to hear his prayersâ€”The reproof of the righteous is a kindness.*

**1**  Lord, I cry unto thee: make [[#^note-1a|haste]] unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. ^verse-1

**2**  Let my [[#^note-2a|prayer]] be set forth before thee as [[#^note-2b|incense]]; and the lifting up of my hands as the [[#^note-2c|evening sacrifice]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Set a watch, O Lord, before my [[#^note-3a|mouth]]; keep the door of my lips. ^verse-3

**4**  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Let]] the righteous [[#^note-5b|smite]] me; it shall be a [[#^note-5c|kindness]]: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. ^verse-5

**6**  When their judges are overthrown in stony places, [[#^note-6a|they]] shall hear my words; for they are sweet. ^verse-6

**7**  Our [[#^note-7a|bones]] are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. ^verse-7

**8**  But mine [[#^note-8a|eyes]] are unto thee, O God the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. ^verse-8

**9**  Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. ^verse-9

**10**  Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape. ^verse-10
