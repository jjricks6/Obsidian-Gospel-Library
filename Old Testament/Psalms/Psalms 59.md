### Psalm 59

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 58|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 60|Next Entry]]

*David prays to be delivered from his enemiesâ€”God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.*

**1**  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Deliver]] me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from [[#^note-2b|bloody]] men. ^verse-2

**3**  For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  They run and prepare themselves [[#^note-4a|without my fault]]: [[#^note-4b|awake]] to help me, and behold. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, they belch out with their mouth: [[#^note-7a|swords]] are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? ^verse-7

**8**  But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. ^verse-8

**9**  Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|The]] God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies. ^verse-10

**11**  Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. ^verse-11

**12**  For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak. ^verse-12

**13**  Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. ^verse-13

**14**  And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. ^verse-14

**15**  Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. ^verse-15

**16**  But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my [[#^note-16a|trouble]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy. ^verse-17
