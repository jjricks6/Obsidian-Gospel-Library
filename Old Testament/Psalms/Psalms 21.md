[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 22|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—He tells of the glory of the great King—The King will triumph over all His enemies—Their evil designs will fail.*

**1**  The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! ^verse-1

**2**  Thou hast given him his heart's [[#^note-2a|desire]], and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. ^verse-2

**3**  For [[#^note-3a|thou preventest him]] with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a [[#^note-3b|crown]] of pure gold on his head. ^verse-3

**4**  He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. ^verse-4

**5**  His [[#^note-5a|glory]] is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. ^verse-5

**6**  For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. ^verse-6

**7**  For the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. ^verse-7

**8**  Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou shalt make them as a [[#^note-9a|fiery]] oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. ^verse-9

**10**  Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their [[#^note-10a|seed]] from among the children of men. ^verse-10

**11**  For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. ^verse-12

**13**  Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power. ^verse-13
