### Psalm 137

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 136|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 138|Next Entry]]

*While in captivity, the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylonâ€”Because of sorrow, they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion.*

**1**  By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. ^verse-1

**2**  We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. ^verse-2

**3**  For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. ^verse-3

**4**  How shall we [[#^note-4a|sing]] the Lord's song in a strange land? ^verse-4

**5**  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. ^verse-5

**6**  If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. ^verse-6

**7**  Remember, O Lord, the children of [[#^note-7a|Edom]] in the day of Jerusalem; who said, [[#^note-7b|Rase]] it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. ^verse-7

**8**  O daughter of [[#^note-8a|Babylon]], who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. ^verse-8

**9**  Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. ^verse-9
