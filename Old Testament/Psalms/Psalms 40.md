[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 39|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 41|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—The Messiah will come and preach righteousness—He will declare salvation—The righteous will say, The Lord be magnified.*

**1**  I [[#^note-1a|waited]] patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. ^verse-1

**2**  He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a [[#^note-2a|rock]], and established my goings. ^verse-2

**3**  And he hath put a [[#^note-3a|new]] [[#^note-3b|song]] in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. ^verse-4

**5**  Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful [[#^note-5a|works]] which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. ^verse-5

**6**  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not [[#^note-6a|desire]]; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, ^verse-7

**8**  I delight to [[#^note-8a|do]] thy [[#^note-8b|will]], O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. ^verse-8

**9**  I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. ^verse-9

**10**  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. ^verse-10

**11**  Withhold not thou thy tender [[#^note-11a|mercies]] from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. ^verse-11

**12**  For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart [[#^note-12a|faileth]] me. ^verse-12

**13**  Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me. ^verse-13

**14**  Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. ^verse-14

**15**  Let them be desolate for a reward of their [[#^note-15a|shame]] that say unto me, Aha, aha. ^verse-15

**16**  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified. ^verse-16

**17**  But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; [[#^note-17a|make no tarrying]], O my God. ^verse-17
