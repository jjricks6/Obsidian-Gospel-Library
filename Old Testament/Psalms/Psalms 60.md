*To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.*

### Psalm 60

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 59|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 61|Next Entry]]

*David says that the Lord has scattered His peopleâ€”The Lord places Ephraim at the head and makes Judah His lawgiver.*

**1**  O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast [[#^note-1a|scattered]] us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of [[#^note-3a|astonishment]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou hast given a [[#^note-4a|banner]] to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  That thy [[#^note-5a|beloved]] may be [[#^note-5b|delivered]]; save with thy right hand, and hear me. ^verse-5

**6**  God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of [[#^note-6a|Succoth]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my [[#^note-7a|lawgiver]]; ^verse-7

**8**  Moab is my washpot; over [[#^note-8a|Edom]] will I cast out my shoe: [[#^note-8b|Philistia]], triumph thou because of me. ^verse-8

**9**  Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? ^verse-9

**10**  Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? ^verse-10

**11**  Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. ^verse-11

**12**  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. ^verse-12
