### Psalm 94

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 93|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 95|Next Entry]]

*The Lord will judge the earth and all men—Blessed is he whom the Lord teaches and chastens—The Lord will not forsake His people, but He will cut off the wicked.*

**1**  O Lord God, to whom [[#^note-1a|vengeance]] belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. ^verse-1

**2**  Lift up thyself, thou [[#^note-2a|judge]] of the earth: render a [[#^note-2b|reward]] to the proud. ^verse-2

**3**  Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked [[#^note-3a|triumph]]? ^verse-3

**4**  How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? ^verse-4

**5**  They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. ^verse-5

**6**  They [[#^note-6a|slay]] the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. ^verse-6

**7**  Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. ^verse-7

**8**  Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? ^verse-8

**9**  He that planted the ear, shall he not [[#^note-9a|hear]]? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? ^verse-9

**10**  He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord [[#^note-11a|knoweth]] the [[#^note-11b|thoughts]] of man, that they are [[#^note-11c|vanity]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Blessed is the man whom thou [[#^note-12a|chastenest]], O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law; ^verse-12

**13**  That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. ^verse-13

**14**  For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he [[#^note-14a|forsake]] his inheritance. ^verse-14

**15**  But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. ^verse-15

**16**  Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? ^verse-16

**17**  Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. ^verse-17

**18**  When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O Lord, held me up. ^verse-18

**19**  In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. ^verse-19

**20**  Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth [[#^note-20a|mischief]] by a law? ^verse-20

**21**  They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. ^verse-21

**22**  But the Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. ^verse-22

**23**  And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off. ^verse-23
