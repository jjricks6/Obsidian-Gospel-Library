### Psalm 50

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 49|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 51|Next Entry]]

*Asaph speaks of the Second Coming—The Lord accepts the sacrifices of the righteous and will deliver them—Those whose conduct is right will see the salvation of God.*

**1**  The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. ^verse-1

**2**  Out of Zion, the [[#^note-2a|perfection]] of [[#^note-2b|beauty]], God hath [[#^note-2c|shined]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a [[#^note-3a|fire]] shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. ^verse-3

**4**  He shall call to the [[#^note-4a|heavens]] from above, and to the earth, that he may [[#^note-4b|judge]] his people. ^verse-4

**5**  Gather my [[#^note-5a|saints]] together unto me; those that have made a [[#^note-5b|covenant]] with me by [[#^note-5c|sacrifice]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And the heavens shall [[#^note-6a|declare]] his [[#^note-6b|righteousness]]: for God is [[#^note-6c|judge]] himself. Selah. ^verse-6

**7**  Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am [[#^note-7a|God]], even thy God. ^verse-7

**8**  I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. ^verse-8

**9**  I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. ^verse-9

**10**  For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. ^verse-10

**11**  I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. ^verse-11

**12**  If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the [[#^note-12a|world]] is mine, and the fulness thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ^verse-13

**14**  Offer unto God [[#^note-14a|thanksgiving]]; and pay thy [[#^note-14b|vows]] unto the most High: ^verse-14

**15**  And [[#^note-15a|call]] upon me in the day of [[#^note-15b|trouble]]: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ^verse-15

**16**  But unto the wicked God saith, [[#^note-16a|What]] hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? ^verse-16

**17**  Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. ^verse-17

**18**  When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth [[#^note-19a|deceit]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou [[#^note-20a|slanderest]] thine own mother's son. ^verse-20

**21**  These things hast thou done, [[#^note-21a|and]] I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. ^verse-21

**22**  Now consider this, ye that [[#^note-22a|forget]] God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. ^verse-22

**23**  Whoso offereth [[#^note-23a|praise]] glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. ^verse-23
