*A Psalm of Asaph.*

### Psalm 73

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 72|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 74|Next Entry]]

*God is good to Israel—The wicked and ungodly prosper in this world—They will be consumed with terrors hereafter—Those who trust in the Lord will be received up unto glory.*

**1**  Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a [[#^note-1a|clean]] heart. ^verse-1

**2**  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. ^verse-2

**3**  For I was [[#^note-3a|envious]] at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. ^verse-3

**4**  For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. ^verse-4

**5**  They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore pride compasseth them about as a [[#^note-6a|chain]]; violence covereth them as a garment. ^verse-6

**7**  Their eyes stand out with [[#^note-7a|fatness]]: they have more than heart could wish. ^verse-7

**8**  They are corrupt, and [[#^note-8a|speak]] wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. ^verse-8

**9**  They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. ^verse-10

**11**  And they say, How doth God [[#^note-11a|know]]? and is there knowledge in the most High? ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, these are the ungodly, who [[#^note-12a|prosper]] in the [[#^note-12b|world]]; they increase in riches. ^verse-12

**13**  Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and [[#^note-13a|washed]] my hands in innocency. ^verse-13

**14**  For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. ^verse-14

**15**  If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. ^verse-15

**16**  When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; ^verse-16

**17**  Until I went into the [[#^note-17a|sanctuary]] of God; then understood I their [[#^note-17b|end]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. ^verse-18

**19**  How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. ^verse-19

**20**  As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou [[#^note-20a|awakest]], thou shalt [[#^note-20b|despise]] their image. ^verse-20

**21**  Thus my heart was grieved, and I was [[#^note-21a|pricked]] in my reins. ^verse-21

**22**  So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a [[#^note-22a|beast]] before thee. ^verse-22

**23**  Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. ^verse-23

**24**  Thou shalt [[#^note-24a|guide]] me with thy [[#^note-24b|counsel]], and afterward receive me to [[#^note-24c|glory]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. ^verse-25

**26**  My [[#^note-26a|flesh]] and my heart [[#^note-26b|faileth]]: but God is the [[#^note-26c|strength]] of my heart, and my [[#^note-26d|portion]] for ever. ^verse-26

**27**  For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. ^verse-27

**28**  But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works. ^verse-28
