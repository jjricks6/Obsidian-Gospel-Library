[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 107|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 109|Next Entry]]

*David praises and exalts Godâ€”Judah is the Lord's lawgiver.*

**1**  O God, my heart is fixed; I will [[#^note-1a|sing]] and give praise, even with my glory. ^verse-1

**2**  Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. ^verse-2

**3**  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. ^verse-3

**4**  For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. ^verse-4

**5**  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; ^verse-5

**6**  That thy [[#^note-6a|beloved]] may be [[#^note-6b|delivered]]: save with thy right hand, and answer me. ^verse-6

**7**  God hath spoken [[#^note-7a|in his holiness]]; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. ^verse-7

**8**  Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; ^verse-8

**9**  Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. ^verse-9

**10**  Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? ^verse-10

**11**  Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? ^verse-11

**12**  Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. ^verse-12

**13**  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. ^verse-13
