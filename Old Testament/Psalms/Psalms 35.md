### Psalm 35

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 34|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 36|Next Entry]]

*David complains of his enemies and their wrong dealingsâ€”He asks the Lord to judge him according to his righteousness.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Plead]] my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: [[#^note-1b|fight]] against them that fight against me. ^verse-1

**2**  Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. ^verse-2

**3**  Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. ^verse-3

**4**  Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. ^verse-4

**5**  Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord chase them. ^verse-5

**6**  Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord [[#^note-6a|persecute]] them. ^verse-6

**7**  For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. ^verse-7

**8**  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. ^verse-8

**9**  And my soul shall be [[#^note-9a|joyful]] in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his [[#^note-9b|salvation]]. ^verse-9

**10**  All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, which [[#^note-10a|deliverest]] the [[#^note-10b|poor]] from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|False]] witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not. ^verse-11

**12**  They [[#^note-12a|rewarded]] me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. ^verse-12

**13**  But as for me, when they were [[#^note-13a|sick]], my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with [[#^note-13b|fasting]]; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. ^verse-13

**14**  I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or [[#^note-14a|brother]]: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. ^verse-14

**15**  But in mine [[#^note-15a|adversity]] they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: ^verse-15

**16**  With hypocritical [[#^note-16a|mockers]] in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. ^verse-16

**17**  Lord, how [[#^note-17a|long]] wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my [[#^note-17b|darling]] from the lions. ^verse-17

**18**  I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. ^verse-18

**19**  Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that [[#^note-19a|hate]] me without a cause. ^verse-19

**20**  For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. ^verse-20

**21**  Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. ^verse-21

**22**  This thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. ^verse-22

**23**  Stir up thyself, and [[#^note-23a|awake]] to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. ^verse-23

**24**  Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. ^verse-24

**25**  Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. ^verse-25

**26**  Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me. ^verse-26

**27**  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath [[#^note-27a|pleasure]] in the prosperity of his servant. ^verse-27

**28**  And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long. ^verse-28
