### Psalm 28

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 29|Next Entry]]

*David pleads with the Lord to hear his voice and grant his petitionsâ€”David prays, Save Thy people and bless Thine inheritance.*

**1**  Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock; be not [[#^note-1a|silent]] to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the [[#^note-1b|pit]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy [[#^note-2a|oracle]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which [[#^note-3a|speak]] [[#^note-3b|peace]] to their neighbours, but [[#^note-3c|mischief]] is in their hearts. ^verse-3

**4**  Give them according to their [[#^note-4a|deeds]], and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their [[#^note-4b|desert]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Because they regard not the [[#^note-5a|works]] of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. ^verse-5

**6**  Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. ^verse-6

**7**  The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart [[#^note-7a|trusted]] in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. ^verse-8

**9**  Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever. ^verse-9
