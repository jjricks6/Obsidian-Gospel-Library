[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 91|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 93|Next Entry]]

*A psalm or song for the Sabbath day—Give thanks unto the Lord—His enemies will perish—The righteous will flourish—There is no unrighteousness in the Lord.*

**1**  It is a good thing to give [[#^note-1a|thanks]] unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: ^verse-1

**2**  To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, ^verse-2

**3**  Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. ^verse-3

**4**  For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. ^verse-4

**5**  O Lord, how great are thy [[#^note-5a|works]]! and thy thoughts are very deep. ^verse-5

**6**  A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. ^verse-6

**7**  When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: ^verse-7

**8**  But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore. ^verse-8

**9**  For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. ^verse-9

**10**  But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of [[#^note-10a|an unicorn]]: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. ^verse-10

**11**  Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. ^verse-11

**12**  The righteous shall [[#^note-12a|flourish]] like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. ^verse-12

**13**  Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. ^verse-13

**14**  They shall still bring forth fruit in [[#^note-14a|old]] age; they shall be fat and flourishing; ^verse-14

**15**  To shew that the Lord is upright: he is my [[#^note-15a|rock]], and there is no [[#^note-15b|unrighteousness]] in him. ^verse-15
