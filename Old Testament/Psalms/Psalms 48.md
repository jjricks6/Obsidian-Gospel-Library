[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 47|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 49|Next Entry]]

*Zion, the city of God, the joy of the whole earth, will be established forever.*

**1**  Great is [[#^note-1a|the]] Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the [[#^note-1b|mountain]] of his [[#^note-1c|holiness]]. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Beautiful]] for situation, the [[#^note-2b|joy]] of the whole earth, is mount [[#^note-2c|Zion]], on the sides of the [[#^note-2d|north]], the [[#^note-2e|city]] of the great King. ^verse-2

**3**  God is known in her palaces for a refuge. ^verse-3

**4**  For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. ^verse-4

**5**  They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away. ^verse-5

**6**  Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a [[#^note-6a|woman]] in travail. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou breakest the [[#^note-7a|ships]] of Tarshish with an east wind. ^verse-7

**8**  As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. ^verse-9

**10**  According to thy [[#^note-10a|name]], O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. ^verse-10

**11**  Let mount Zion rejoice, let the [[#^note-11a|daughters]] of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. ^verse-11

**12**  Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the [[#^note-13a|generation]] following. ^verse-13

**14**  For this God is our God for [[#^note-14a|ever]] and ever: he will be our guide even unto death. ^verse-14
