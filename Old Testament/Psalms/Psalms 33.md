### Psalm 33

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 32|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 34|Next Entry]]

*Rejoice in the Lord—Sing unto Him a new song—He loves righteousness and judgment—Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.*

**1**  Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for [[#^note-1a|praise]] is comely for the upright. ^verse-1

**2**  Praise the Lord with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. ^verse-2

**3**  Sing unto him a [[#^note-3a|new song]]; play skilfully with a loud noise. ^verse-3

**4**  For the [[#^note-4a|word]] of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth. ^verse-4

**5**  He loveth [[#^note-5a|righteousness]] and [[#^note-5b|judgment]]: the earth is [[#^note-5c|full]] of the goodness of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  By the [[#^note-6a|word]] of the Lord were the [[#^note-6b|heavens]] made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. ^verse-6

**7**  He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. ^verse-7

**8**  Let all the earth fear the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. ^verse-8

**9**  For he [[#^note-9a|spake]], and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. ^verse-9

**10**  The Lord bringeth the [[#^note-10a|counsel]] of the [[#^note-10b|heathen]] to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. ^verse-10

**11**  The [[#^note-11a|counsel]] of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. ^verse-11

**12**  Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath [[#^note-12a|chosen]] for his own inheritance. ^verse-12

**13**  The Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. ^verse-13

**14**  From the place of his habitation he [[#^note-14a|looketh]] upon all the inhabitants of the earth. ^verse-14

**15**  He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their [[#^note-15a|works]]. ^verse-15

**16**  There is no king [[#^note-16a|saved]] by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. ^verse-16

**17**  An [[#^note-17a|horse]] is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he [[#^note-17b|deliver]] any by his great strength. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, the [[#^note-18a|eye]] of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; ^verse-18

**19**  To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in [[#^note-19a|famine]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our [[#^note-20a|shield]]. ^verse-20

**21**  For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. ^verse-21

**22**  Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we [[#^note-22a|hope]] in thee. ^verse-22
