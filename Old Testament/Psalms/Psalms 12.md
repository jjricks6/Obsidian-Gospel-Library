### Psalm 12

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 13|Next Entry]]

*David decries flattering lips and proud tonguesâ€”He says, The words of the Lord are pure words.*

**1**  Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. ^verse-1

**2**  They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a [[#^note-2a|double heart]] do they speak. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord shall cut off all [[#^note-3a|flattering]] lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: ^verse-3

**4**  Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? ^verse-4

**5**  For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. ^verse-5

**6**  The [[#^note-6a|words]] of the Lord are [[#^note-6b|pure]] words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. ^verse-7

**8**  The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. ^verse-8
