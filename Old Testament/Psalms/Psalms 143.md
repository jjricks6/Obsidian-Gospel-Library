### Psalm 143

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 142|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 144|Next Entry]]

*David prays for favor in judgmentâ€”He meditates on the Lord's works and trusts in Him.*

**1**  Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications: in thy [[#^note-1a|faithfulness]] answer me, and in thy righteousness. ^verse-1

**2**  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be [[#^note-2a|justified]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. ^verse-4

**5**  I remember the days of old; I [[#^note-5a|meditate]] on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. ^verse-5

**6**  I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul [[#^note-6a|thirsteth]] after thee, as a [[#^note-6b|thirsty]] land. Selah. ^verse-6

**7**  Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the [[#^note-7a|pit]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the [[#^note-8a|way]] wherein I should walk; for I [[#^note-8b|lift up]] my soul unto thee. ^verse-8

**9**  Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. ^verse-9

**10**  Teach me to do thy [[#^note-10a|will]]; for thou art my God: thy [[#^note-10b|spirit]] is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. ^verse-10

**11**  Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. ^verse-11

**12**  And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. ^verse-12
