### Psalm 106

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 105|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 107|Next Entry]]

*Praise the Lord for His mercy and mighty works—Israel rebelled and did wickedly—Moses mediated between Israel and the Lord—Israel was scattered and slain for worshipping false gods.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Praise ye the Lord]]. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is [[#^note-1b|good]]: for his mercy endureth for ever. ^verse-1

**2**  Who can utter the mighty [[#^note-2a|acts]] of the Lord? who can shew forth all his praise? ^verse-2

**3**  Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. ^verse-3

**4**  Remember me, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; ^verse-4

**5**  That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. ^verse-5

**6**  We have [[#^note-6a|sinned]] with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. ^verse-6

**7**  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but [[#^note-7a|provoked]] him at the sea, even at the [[#^note-7b|Red sea]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Nevertheless he saved them for his [[#^note-8a|name's]] sake, that he might make his mighty [[#^note-8b|power]] to be known. ^verse-8

**9**  He [[#^note-9a|rebuked]] the [[#^note-9b|Red sea]] also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. ^verse-9

**10**  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. ^verse-10

**11**  And the waters covered their enemies: there was not [[#^note-11a|one]] of them left. ^verse-11

**12**  Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. ^verse-12

**13**  They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: ^verse-13

**14**  But [[#^note-14a|lusted]] exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. ^verse-14

**15**  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. ^verse-15

**16**  They [[#^note-16a|envied]] Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  The earth [[#^note-17a|opened]] and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. ^verse-17

**18**  And a [[#^note-18a|fire]] was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. ^verse-18

**19**  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the [[#^note-19a|molten image]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. ^verse-20

**21**  They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; ^verse-21

**22**  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. ^verse-22

**23**  Therefore he said that he would [[#^note-23a|destroy]] them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. ^verse-23

**24**  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they [[#^note-24a|believed not]] his word: ^verse-24

**25**  But [[#^note-25a|murmured]] in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord. ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: ^verse-26

**27**  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. ^verse-27

**28**  They joined themselves also unto [[#^note-28a|Baal-peor]], and [[#^note-28b|ate]] the sacrifices [[#^note-28c|of]] the dead. ^verse-28

**29**  Thus they provoked him to anger with their [[#^note-29a|inventions]]: and the plague brake in upon them. ^verse-29

**30**  Then stood up [[#^note-30a|Phinehas]], and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. ^verse-30

**31**  And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. ^verse-31

**32**  They angered him also at the waters of [[#^note-32a|strife]], so that it went ill with Moses for their [[#^note-32b|sakes]]: ^verse-32

**33**  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he [[#^note-33a|spake]] unadvisedly with his lips. ^verse-33

**34**  They did not [[#^note-34a|destroy]] the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: ^verse-34

**35**  But were [[#^note-35a|mingled]] among the heathen, and learned their works. ^verse-35

**36**  And they served their [[#^note-36a|idols]]: which were a snare unto them. ^verse-36

**37**  Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, ^verse-37

**38**  And shed innocent [[#^note-38a|blood]], even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the [[#^note-38b|idols]] of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. ^verse-38

**39**  Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. ^verse-39

**40**  Therefore was the [[#^note-40a|wrath]] of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. ^verse-40

**41**  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. ^verse-41

**42**  Their [[#^note-42a|enemies]] also [[#^note-42b|oppressed]] them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. ^verse-42

**43**  Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. ^verse-43

**44**  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: ^verse-44

**45**  And he remembered for them his [[#^note-45a|covenant]], and [[#^note-45b|repented]] according to the multitude of his mercies. ^verse-45

**46**  He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. ^verse-46

**47**  Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. ^verse-47

**48**  [[#^note-48a|Blessed]] be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord. ^verse-48
