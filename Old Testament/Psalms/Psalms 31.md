*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 31

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 30|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 32|Next Entry]]

*David trusts in the Lord and rejoices in His mercy—Speaking as the Messiah he says, Into Thine hand I commit my spirit—He counsels, O love the Lord, all ye His Saints, for the Lord preserves the faithful.*

**1**  In thee, O Lord, do I put my [[#^note-1a|trust]]; let me never be [[#^note-1b|ashamed]]: deliver me in thy [[#^note-1c|righteousness]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. ^verse-2

**3**  For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy [[#^note-3a|name's]] sake lead me, and guide me. ^verse-3

**4**  Pull me out of the [[#^note-4a|net]] that they have laid [[#^note-4b|privily]] for me: for thou art my strength. ^verse-4

**5**  Into thine hand I commit my [[#^note-5a|spirit]]: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. ^verse-5

**6**  I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; ^verse-7

**8**  And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. ^verse-8

**9**  Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my [[#^note-9a|belly]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. ^verse-10

**11**  I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without [[#^note-11a|fled]] from me. ^verse-11

**12**  I am [[#^note-12a|forgotten]] as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken [[#^note-12b|vessel]]. ^verse-12

**13**  For I have heard the [[#^note-13a|slander]] of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. ^verse-13

**14**  But I [[#^note-14a|trusted]] in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. ^verse-14

**15**  My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. ^verse-15

**16**  Make thy face to [[#^note-16a|shine]] upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake. ^verse-16

**17**  Let me not be [[#^note-17a|ashamed]], O Lord; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. ^verse-17

**18**  Let the [[#^note-18a|lying]] lips be put to [[#^note-18b|silence]]; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. ^verse-18

**19**  Oh how great is thy [[#^note-19a|goodness]], which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! ^verse-19

**20**  Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a [[#^note-20a|pavilion]] from the [[#^note-20b|strife]] of tongues. ^verse-20

**21**  Blessed be the Lord: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. ^verse-21

**22**  For I said in my [[#^note-22a|haste]], I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. ^verse-22

**23**  O [[#^note-23a|love]] the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord [[#^note-23b|preserveth]] the [[#^note-23c|faithful]], and plentifully [[#^note-23d|rewardeth]] the proud doer. ^verse-23

**24**  Be of good [[#^note-24a|courage]], and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that [[#^note-24b|hope in]] the Lord. ^verse-24
