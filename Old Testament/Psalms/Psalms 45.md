### Psalm 45

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 44|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 46|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm—The Messiah is fairer than the children of men—He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows—His name will be remembered in all generations.*

**1**  My heart is [[#^note-1a|inditing]] a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou art fairer than the children of men: [[#^note-2a|grace]] is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. ^verse-2

**3**  Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy [[#^note-3a|glory]] and thy majesty. ^verse-3

**4**  And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and [[#^note-4a|righteousness]]; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. ^verse-4

**5**  Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. ^verse-5

**6**  Thy [[#^note-6a|throne]], O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of [[#^note-7a|gladness]] above thy fellows. ^verse-7

**8**  All thy garments smell of [[#^note-8a|myrrh]], and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. ^verse-8

**9**  Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. ^verse-9

**10**  Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; ^verse-10

**11**  So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. ^verse-11

**12**  And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour. ^verse-12

**13**  The king's daughter is all glorious within: her [[#^note-13a|clothing]] is of wrought gold. ^verse-13

**14**  She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. ^verse-14

**15**  With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace. ^verse-15

**16**  Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. ^verse-17
