### Psalm 62

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 61|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 63|Next Entry]]

*David praises God as his defense, his rock, and his salvationâ€”The Lord judges men according to their works.*

**1**  Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. ^verse-1

**2**  He only is my rock and my [[#^note-2a|salvation]]; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. ^verse-2

**3**  How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. ^verse-3

**4**  They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they [[#^note-4a|curse]] inwardly. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. ^verse-5

**6**  He only is my [[#^note-6a|rock]] and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. ^verse-6

**7**  In God is my salvation and my [[#^note-7a|glory]]: the rock of my strength, and my [[#^note-7b|refuge]], is in God. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Trust]] in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  Surely men of low degree are [[#^note-9a|vanity]], and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. ^verse-9

**10**  Trust not in [[#^note-10a|oppression]], and become not vain in robbery: if [[#^note-10b|riches]] increase, set not your [[#^note-10c|heart]] upon them. ^verse-10

**11**  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. ^verse-11

**12**  Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth [[#^note-12a|mercy]]: for thou renderest to every man according to his [[#^note-12b|work]]. ^verse-12
