### Psalm 86

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 85|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 87|Next Entry]]

*David implores God for mercy and is saved from the lowest hell—The Lord is good and generous in mercy—All nations will worship before Him.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Bow down]] thine ear, O Lord, hear me: for I am [[#^note-1b|poor]] and needy. ^verse-1

**2**  Preserve my [[#^note-2a|soul]]; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. ^verse-2

**3**  Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. ^verse-3

**4**  Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I [[#^note-4a|lift up]] my soul. ^verse-4

**5**  For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to [[#^note-5a|forgive]]; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. ^verse-5

**6**  Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. ^verse-6

**7**  In the day of my trouble I will [[#^note-7a|call]] upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. ^verse-7

**8**  Among the [[#^note-8a|gods]] there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|All]] [[#^note-9b|nations]] whom thou hast made shall [[#^note-9c|come]] and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. ^verse-9

**10**  For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Teach]] me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. ^verse-11

**12**  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. ^verse-12

**13**  For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast [[#^note-13a|delivered]] my soul from the lowest hell. ^verse-13

**14**  O God, the [[#^note-14a|proud]] are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. ^verse-14

**15**  But thou, O [[#^note-15a|Lord]], art a God full of [[#^note-15b|compassion]], and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in [[#^note-15c|mercy]] and truth. ^verse-15

**16**  O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. ^verse-16

**17**  Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me. ^verse-17
