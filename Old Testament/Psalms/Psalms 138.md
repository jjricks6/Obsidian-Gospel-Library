**1**  I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. ^verse-1

**2**  I will [[#^note-2a|worship]] toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. ^verse-2

**3**  In the day when I [[#^note-3a|cried]] thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. ^verse-3

**4**  All the [[#^note-4a|kings]] of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth. ^verse-4

**5**  Yea, they shall [[#^note-5a|sing]] in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. ^verse-6

**7**  Though I walk in the midst of [[#^note-7a|trouble]], thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|The]] Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: forsake not the [[#^note-8b|works]] of thine own hands. ^verse-8
