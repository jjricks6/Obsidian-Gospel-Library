*Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.*

### Psalm 7

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 8|Next Entry]]

*David trusts in the Lord, who will judge the peopleâ€”God is angry with the wicked.*

**1**  O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: ^verse-1

**2**  Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. ^verse-2

**3**  O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; ^verse-3

**4**  If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) ^verse-4

**5**  Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. ^verse-6

**7**  So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord shall [[#^note-8a|judge]] the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. ^verse-8

**9**  Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God [[#^note-9a|trieth]] the hearts and reins. ^verse-9

**10**  My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. ^verse-10

**11**  God judgeth the righteous, and God is [[#^note-11a|angry]] with the wicked every day. ^verse-11

**12**  If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. ^verse-12

**13**  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived [[#^note-14a|mischief]], and brought forth falsehood. ^verse-14

**15**  He made a pit, and digged it, and is [[#^note-15a|fallen]] into the ditch which he made. ^verse-15

**16**  His mischief shall [[#^note-16a|return]] upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. ^verse-16

**17**  I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high. ^verse-17
