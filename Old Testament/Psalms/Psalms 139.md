*To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 139

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 138|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 140|Next Entry]]

*David says that the Lord knows all man's thoughts and doings—He asks, Where can man go to escape from the spirit and presence of the Lord?—Man is fearfully and wonderfully made.*

**1**  O Lord, thou hast [[#^note-1a|searched]] me, and [[#^note-1b|known]] me. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my [[#^note-2a|thought]] afar off. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art [[#^note-3a|acquainted]] with all my ways. ^verse-3

**4**  For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. ^verse-5

**6**  Such [[#^note-6a|knowledge]] is too [[#^note-6b|wonderful]] for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. ^verse-6

**7**  Whither shall I go from thy [[#^note-7a|spirit]]? or whither shall I flee from thy [[#^note-7b|presence]]? ^verse-7

**8**  If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in [[#^note-8a|hell]], behold, thou art there. ^verse-8

**9**  If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; ^verse-9

**10**  Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. ^verse-10

**11**  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. ^verse-12

**13**  For thou hast [[#^note-13a|possessed my reins]]: thou hast [[#^note-13b|covered]] me in my mother's womb. ^verse-13

**14**  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. ^verse-14

**15**  My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. ^verse-15

**16**  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy [[#^note-16a|book]] all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. ^verse-16

**17**  How precious also are thy [[#^note-17a|thoughts]] unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! ^verse-17

**18**  If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. ^verse-18

**19**  Surely thou wilt [[#^note-19a|slay]] the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. ^verse-19

**20**  For they [[#^note-20a|speak]] against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in [[#^note-20b|vain]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? ^verse-21

**22**  I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. ^verse-22

**23**  Search me, O God, and know my heart: [[#^note-23a|try]] me, and know my thoughts: ^verse-23

**24**  And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. ^verse-24
