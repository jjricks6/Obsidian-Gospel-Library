### Psalm 105

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 104|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 106|Next Entry]]

*Make the Lord's doings known among all men—Show His covenant with Abraham and His dealings with Israel—Touch not His anointed, and do His prophets no harm—Israel is to observe His statutes and keep His laws.*

**1**  O give [[#^note-1a|thanks]] unto the Lord; call upon his name: [[#^note-1b|make known]] his deeds among the people. ^verse-1

**2**  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: [[#^note-2a|talk]] ye of all his wondrous works. ^verse-2

**3**  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. ^verse-3

**4**  Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore. ^verse-4

**5**  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; ^verse-5

**6**  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. ^verse-6

**7**  He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth. ^verse-7

**8**  He hath remembered his [[#^note-8a|covenant]] for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. ^verse-8

**9**  Which [[#^note-9a|covenant]] he made with Abraham, and his [[#^note-9b|oath]] unto Isaac; ^verse-9

**10**  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an [[#^note-10a|everlasting covenant]]: ^verse-10

**11**  Saying, Unto thee will I give the [[#^note-11a|land of Canaan]], the lot of your inheritance: ^verse-11

**12**  When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. ^verse-12

**13**  When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; ^verse-13

**14**  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he [[#^note-14a|reproved]] kings for their sakes; ^verse-14

**15**  Saying, Touch not mine [[#^note-15a|anointed]], and do my [[#^note-15b|prophets]] no harm. ^verse-15

**16**  Moreover he called for a [[#^note-16a|famine]] upon the land: he brake the whole [[#^note-16b|staff]] of bread. ^verse-16

**17**  He [[#^note-17a|sent]] a man before them, even Joseph, who was [[#^note-17b|sold]] for a servant: ^verse-17

**18**  Whose feet they hurt with [[#^note-18a|fetters]]: he was laid in iron: ^verse-18

**19**  Until the time that his [[#^note-19a|word]] came: the word of the Lord tried him. ^verse-19

**20**  The [[#^note-20a|king]] sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. ^verse-20

**21**  He made him [[#^note-21a|lord]] of his house, and ruler of all his substance: ^verse-21

**22**  To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his [[#^note-22a|senators]] wisdom. ^verse-22

**23**  Israel also came into [[#^note-23a|Egypt]]; and Jacob sojourned in the land of [[#^note-23b|Ham]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And he [[#^note-24a|increased]] his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. ^verse-24

**25**  He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal [[#^note-25a|subtilly]] with his servants. ^verse-25

**26**  He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. ^verse-26

**27**  They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. ^verse-27

**28**  He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. ^verse-28

**29**  He turned their waters into [[#^note-29a|blood]], and slew their fish. ^verse-29

**30**  Their land brought forth [[#^note-30a|frogs]] in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. ^verse-30

**31**  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and [[#^note-31a|lice]] in all their [[#^note-31b|coasts]]. ^verse-31

**32**  He gave them [[#^note-32a|hail]] for rain, and flaming fire in their land. ^verse-32

**33**  He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. ^verse-33

**34**  He spake, and the [[#^note-34a|locusts]] came, and caterpillers, and that without number, ^verse-34

**35**  And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. ^verse-35

**36**  He smote also all the [[#^note-36a|firstborn]] in their land, the chief of all their strength. ^verse-36

**37**  He brought [[#^note-37a|them]] forth also with [[#^note-37b|silver]] and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. ^verse-37

**38**  Egypt was [[#^note-38a|glad]] when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. ^verse-38

**39**  He spread a [[#^note-39a|cloud]] for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. ^verse-39

**40**  The people asked, and he brought [[#^note-40a|quails]], and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. ^verse-40

**41**  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. ^verse-41

**42**  For he remembered his holy [[#^note-42a|promise]], and Abraham his servant. ^verse-42

**43**  And he brought forth his [[#^note-43a|people]] with joy, and his chosen with gladness: ^verse-43

**44**  And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; ^verse-44

**45**  That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the Lord. ^verse-45
