**5**  He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. ^verse-5

**6**  This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, [[#^note-6a|O Jacob]]. Selah. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Lift]] up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall [[#^note-7b|come]] in. ^verse-7

**8**    Who is this [[#^note-8a|King]] of [[#^note-8b|glory]]? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. ^verse-8
