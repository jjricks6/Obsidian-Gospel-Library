[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 42|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 44|Next Entry]]

*The righteous praise God and cry, Send out Thy light and Thy truth.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Judge]] me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the [[#^note-1b|deceitful]] and unjust man. ^verse-1

**2**  For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I [[#^note-2a|mourning]] because of the oppression of the enemy? ^verse-2

**3**  O send out thy [[#^note-3a|light]] and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy [[#^note-3b|tabernacles]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. ^verse-4

**5**  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. ^verse-5
