### Psalm 132

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 131|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 133|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm—Of the fruit of David's loins will the Lord set One upon His throne—The Lord will bless Zion, and her Saints will shout for joy.*

**1**  Lord, [[#^note-1a|remember]] David, and all his afflictions: ^verse-1

**2**  How he sware unto the Lord, and [[#^note-2a|vowed]] unto the [[#^note-2b|mighty God]] of Jacob; ^verse-2

**3**  Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; ^verse-3

**4**  I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, ^verse-4

**5**  Until I find out a place for the Lord, an [[#^note-5a|habitation]] for the mighty God of Jacob. ^verse-5

**6**  Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of [[#^note-6a|the wood]]. ^verse-6

**7**  We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. ^verse-7

**8**  Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. ^verse-8

**9**  Let thy [[#^note-9a|priests]] be clothed with [[#^note-9b|righteousness]]; and let thy saints shout for joy. ^verse-9

**10**  For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord hath sworn in truth unto [[#^note-11a|David]]; he will not turn from it; Of the [[#^note-11b|fruit]] of thy body will I set upon thy [[#^note-11c|throne]]. ^verse-11

**12**  If thy [[#^note-12a|children]] will keep my [[#^note-12b|covenant]] and my [[#^note-12c|testimony]] that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy [[#^note-12d|throne]] for evermore. ^verse-12

**13**  For the Lord hath chosen [[#^note-13a|Zion]]; he hath desired it for his habitation. ^verse-13

**14**  This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. ^verse-14

**15**  I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her [[#^note-15a|poor]] with bread. ^verse-15

**16**  I will also [[#^note-16a|clothe]] her priests with salvation: and her saints shall [[#^note-16b|shout]] aloud for joy. ^verse-16

**17**  There will I make the [[#^note-17a|horn]] of [[#^note-17b|David]] to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. ^verse-17

**18**  His enemies will I clothe with [[#^note-18a|shame]]: but upon himself shall his crown flourish. ^verse-18
