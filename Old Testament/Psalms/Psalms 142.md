*Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.*

### Psalm 142

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 141|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 143|Next Entry]]

*David prays for preservation from his persecutors.*

**1**  I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. ^verse-1

**2**  I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. ^verse-2

**3**  When my spirit was [[#^note-3a|overwhelmed]] within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a [[#^note-3b|snare]] for me. ^verse-3

**4**  I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man [[#^note-4a|cared]] for my soul. ^verse-4

**5**  I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. ^verse-5

**6**  Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. ^verse-6

**7**  Bring my [[#^note-7a|soul]] out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. ^verse-7
