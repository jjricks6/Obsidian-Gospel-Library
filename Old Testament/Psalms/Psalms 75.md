[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 74|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 76|Next Entry]]

*The righteous praise and thank the God of Jacob—They will be exalted—God is the judge, and the wicked will be condemned.*

**1**  Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. ^verse-1

**2**  When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. ^verse-2

**3**  The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the [[#^note-3a|pillars]] of it. Selah. ^verse-3

**4**  I said unto the [[#^note-4a|fools]], Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: ^verse-4

**5**  Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a [[#^note-5a|stiff]] neck. ^verse-5

**6**  For [[#^note-6a|promotion]] cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. ^verse-6

**7**  But God is the [[#^note-7a|judge]]: he putteth [[#^note-7b|down]] one, and setteth up another. ^verse-7

**8**  For in the hand of the Lord there is a [[#^note-8a|cup]], and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and [[#^note-8b|drink]] them. ^verse-8

**9**  But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. ^verse-9

**10**  All the [[#^note-10a|horns]] of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. ^verse-10
