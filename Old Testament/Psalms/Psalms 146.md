### Psalm 146

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 145|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 147|Next Entry]]

*Happy are they whose hope is in the Lordâ€”The Lord frees the prisoners, loves the righteous, and reigns forever.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Praise ye the Lord]]. Praise the Lord, O my soul. ^verse-1

**2**  While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. ^verse-2

**3**  Put not your [[#^note-3a|trust]] in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. ^verse-3

**4**  His [[#^note-4a|breath]] goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Happy]] is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God: ^verse-5

**6**  Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: ^verse-6

**7**  Which executeth judgment for the [[#^note-7a|oppressed]]: which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners: ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord openeth the [[#^note-8a|eyes]] of the [[#^note-8b|blind]]: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous: ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the [[#^note-9a|fatherless]] and [[#^note-9b|widow]]: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. ^verse-9

**10**  The Lord shall reign for [[#^note-10a|ever]], even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord. ^verse-10
