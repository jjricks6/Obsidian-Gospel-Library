**3**  If thou, Lord, shouldest mark [[#^note-3a|iniquities]], O Lord, who shall [[#^note-3b|stand]]? ^verse-3

**4**  But there is [[#^note-4a|forgiveness]] with thee, that thou mayest be [[#^note-4b|feared]]. ^verse-4

**5**  I [[#^note-5a|wait for]] the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. ^verse-5

**6**  My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. ^verse-6
