*A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 27

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 26|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 28|Next Entry]]

*David says, The Lord is my light and my salvation—He desires to dwell in the house of the Lord forever—He counsels, Wait on the Lord and be of good courage.*

**1**  The Lord is my [[#^note-1a|light]] and my [[#^note-1b|salvation]]; whom shall I [[#^note-1c|fear]]? the Lord is the [[#^note-1d|strength]] of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? ^verse-1

**2**  When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. ^verse-2

**3**  Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. ^verse-3

**4**  One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may [[#^note-4a|dwell]] in the [[#^note-4b|house]] of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the [[#^note-4c|beauty]] of the Lord, and to [[#^note-4d|inquire]] in his temple. ^verse-4

**5**  For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his [[#^note-5a|pavilion]]: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a [[#^note-5b|rock]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. ^verse-7

**8**  When thou saidst, [[#^note-8a|Seek]] ye my [[#^note-8b|face]]; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek. ^verse-8

**9**  Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. ^verse-9

**10**  When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Teach]] me thy way, O Lord, and [[#^note-11b|lead]] me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. ^verse-11

**12**  Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for [[#^note-12a|false witnesses]] are risen up against me, and such as breathe out [[#^note-12b|cruelty]]. ^verse-12

**13**  I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the [[#^note-13a|land]] of the living. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Wait]] on the Lord: be of good [[#^note-14b|courage]], and he shall strengthen thine heart: [[#^note-14c|wait]], I say, on the Lord. ^verse-14
