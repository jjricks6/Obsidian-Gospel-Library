### Psalm 144

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 143|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 145|Next Entry]]

*David blesses the Lord for deliverance and temporal prosperityâ€”Happy is that people whose God is the Lord.*

**1**  Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to [[#^note-1a|war]], and my fingers to fight: ^verse-1

**2**  My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. ^verse-2

**3**  Lord, what is [[#^note-3a|man]], that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him! ^verse-3

**4**  Man is like to [[#^note-4a|vanity]]: his days are as a [[#^note-4b|shadow]] that passeth away. ^verse-4

**5**  Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. ^verse-5

**6**  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. ^verse-6

**7**  Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of [[#^note-7a|strange]] children; ^verse-7

**8**  Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of [[#^note-8a|falsehood]]. ^verse-8

**9**  I will [[#^note-9a|sing]] a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. ^verse-9

**10**  It is he that giveth [[#^note-10a|salvation]] unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. ^verse-10

**11**  Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh [[#^note-11a|vanity]], and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood: ^verse-11

**12**  That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace: ^verse-12

**13**  That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: ^verse-13

**14**  That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Happy]] is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord. ^verse-15
