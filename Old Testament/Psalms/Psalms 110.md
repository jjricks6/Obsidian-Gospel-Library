**1**  The [[#^note-1a|Lord]] said unto my [[#^note-1b|Lord]], Sit thou at my [[#^note-1c|right]] [[#^note-1d|hand]], until I make thine [[#^note-1e|enemies]] thy footstool. ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord shall send the [[#^note-2a|rod]] of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. ^verse-2

**3**  Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord hath [[#^note-4a|sworn]], and will not [[#^note-4b|repent]], Thou art a [[#^note-4c|priest]] for ever after the order of [[#^note-4d|Melchizedek]]. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. ^verse-5

**6**  He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. ^verse-6

**7**  He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. ^verse-7
