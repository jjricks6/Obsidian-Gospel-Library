### Psalm 109

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 108|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 110|Next Entry]]

*David speaks of the cursings due to the wicked and deceitfulâ€”He prays that his enemies will be confounded.*

**1**  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; ^verse-1

**2**  For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a [[#^note-2a|lying]] tongue. ^verse-2

**3**  They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|For]] my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. ^verse-4

**5**  And they have rewarded me evil for good, and [[#^note-5a|hatred]] for my love. ^verse-5

**6**  Set thou a wicked man over him: and let [[#^note-6a|Satan]] stand at his right hand. ^verse-6

**7**  When he shall be [[#^note-7a|judged]], let him be condemned: and let his [[#^note-7b|prayer]] become sin. ^verse-7

**8**  Let his days be few; and let another take his [[#^note-8a|office]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ^verse-9

**10**  Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. ^verse-10

**11**  Let the [[#^note-11a|extortioner catch]] all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. ^verse-11

**12**  Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. ^verse-12

**13**  Let his [[#^note-13a|posterity]] be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be [[#^note-13b|blotted out]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Let the [[#^note-14a|iniquity]] of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. ^verse-14

**15**  Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. ^verse-15

**16**  Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the [[#^note-16a|poor]] and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. ^verse-16

**17**  As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. ^verse-17

**18**  As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. ^verse-18

**19**  Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. ^verse-19

**20**  Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, and of them that speak evil against my soul. ^verse-20

**21**  But do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy [[#^note-21a|name's]] sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. ^verse-21

**22**  For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. ^verse-22

**23**  I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. ^verse-23

**24**  My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. ^verse-24

**25**  I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. ^verse-25

**26**  Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy: ^verse-26

**27**  That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, Lord, hast done it. ^verse-27

**28**  Let them [[#^note-28a|curse]], but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. ^verse-28

**29**  Let mine adversaries be clothed with [[#^note-29a|shame]], and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. ^verse-29

**30**  I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. ^verse-30

**31**  For he shall stand at the [[#^note-31a|right hand]] of the [[#^note-31b|poor]], to save him from those that condemn his soul. ^verse-31
