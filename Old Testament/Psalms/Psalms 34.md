[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 33|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 35|Next Entry]]

*David blesses the Lord at all times—He counsels, Keep your tongue from evil; do good and seek peace—He says that not one of the Messiah's bones will be broken.*

**1**  I will [[#^note-1a|bless]] the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. ^verse-1

**2**  My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. ^verse-2

**3**  O [[#^note-3a|magnify]] the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. ^verse-3

**4**  I [[#^note-4a|sought]] the Lord, and he [[#^note-4b|heard]] me, and delivered me from all my fears. ^verse-4

**5**  They looked unto him, and were [[#^note-5a|lightened]]: and their faces were not ashamed. ^verse-5

**6**  This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|angel]] of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. ^verse-7

**8**  O [[#^note-8a|taste]] and see that the Lord is [[#^note-8b|good]]: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. ^verse-8

**9**  O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. ^verse-9

**10**  The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not [[#^note-10a|want]] any good thing. ^verse-10

**11**  Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? ^verse-12

**13**  Keep thy [[#^note-13a|tongue]] from evil, and thy lips from speaking [[#^note-13b|guile]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Depart from evil, and do [[#^note-14a|good]]; seek [[#^note-14b|peace]], and pursue it. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|eyes]] of the Lord are upon the [[#^note-15b|righteous]], and his ears are open unto their cry. ^verse-15

**16**  The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and [[#^note-17a|delivereth]] them out of all their troubles. ^verse-17

**18**  The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and [[#^note-18a|saveth]] such as be [[#^note-18b|of a contrite spirit]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Many are the [[#^note-19a|afflictions]] of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. ^verse-19

**20**  He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is [[#^note-20a|broken]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. ^verse-21

**22**  The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that [[#^note-22a|trust]] in him shall be desolate. ^verse-22
