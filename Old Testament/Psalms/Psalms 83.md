[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 82|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 84|Next Entry]]

*God is asked to confound the enemies of His peopleâ€”Jehovah is the Most High over all the earth.*

**1**  Keep not thou [[#^note-1a|silence]], O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. ^verse-1

**2**  For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. ^verse-2

**3**  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. ^verse-3

**4**  They have said, Come, and let us [[#^note-4a|cut]] them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. ^verse-4

**5**  For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: ^verse-5

**6**  The [[#^note-6a|tabernacles]] of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; ^verse-6

**7**  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; ^verse-7

**8**  Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to [[#^note-9a|Sisera]], as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: ^verse-9

**10**  Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as [[#^note-11a|Zebah]], and as Zalmunna: ^verse-11

**12**  Who said, Let us take to ourselves the [[#^note-12a|houses]] of God in possession. ^verse-12

**13**  O my God, make them like a [[#^note-13a|wheel]]; as the [[#^note-13b|stubble]] before the wind. ^verse-13

**14**  As the fire burneth a [[#^note-14a|wood]], and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; ^verse-14

**15**  So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. ^verse-15

**16**  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and [[#^note-17a|perish]]: ^verse-17

**18**  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is [[#^note-18a|Jehovah]], art the most [[#^note-18b|high]] over all the earth. ^verse-18
