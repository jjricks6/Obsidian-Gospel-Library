*A Song of degrees for Solomon.*

### Psalm 127

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 126|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 128|Next Entry]]

*Children are a heritage from the Lord.*

**1**  Except the Lord build the house, they [[#^note-1a|labour]] in vain that build it: except the Lord [[#^note-1b|keep]] the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. ^verse-1

**2**  It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved [[#^note-2a|sleep]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Lo, [[#^note-3a|children]] are an [[#^note-3b|heritage]] of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his [[#^note-3c|reward]]. ^verse-3

**4**  As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Happy]] is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. ^verse-5
