### Psalm 2

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 3|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm—The heathen will rage against the Lord's anointed—The Lord speaks of His Son, whom He has begotten.*

**1**  Why do the [[#^note-1a|heathen]] rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|kings]] of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take [[#^note-2b|counsel]] together, against the Lord, and against his [[#^note-2c|anointed]], saying, ^verse-2

**3**  Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. ^verse-3

**4**  He that sitteth in the heavens shall [[#^note-4a|laugh]]: the Lord shall have them in derision. ^verse-4

**5**  Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. ^verse-5

**6**  Yet have I [[#^note-6a|set my king]] upon my [[#^note-6b|holy hill]] of Zion. ^verse-6

**7**  I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my [[#^note-7a|Son]]; this day have I begotten thee. ^verse-7

**8**  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou shalt [[#^note-9a|break]] them with a [[#^note-9b|rod of iron]]; thou shalt [[#^note-9c|dash]] them in pieces like a potter's vessel. ^verse-9

**10**  Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  Serve the Lord with [[#^note-11a|fear]], and rejoice with trembling. ^verse-11

**12**  Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. [[#^note-12a|Blessed]] are all they that put their [[#^note-12b|trust]] in him. ^verse-12
