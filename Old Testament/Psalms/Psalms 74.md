[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 73|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 75|Next Entry]]

*O God, remember Thy chosen congregation—The wicked destroy the sanctuary and burn the synagogues—O God, remember them for their deeds, and save Thy people.*

**1**  O God, why hast thou [[#^note-1a|cast]] us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? ^verse-1

**2**  Remember thy congregation, which thou hast [[#^note-2a|purchased]] of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. ^verse-2

**3**  Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. ^verse-3

**4**  Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their [[#^note-4a|ensigns]] for signs. ^verse-4

**5**  A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. ^verse-5

**6**  But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. ^verse-6

**7**  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. ^verse-7

**8**  They said in their hearts, Let us [[#^note-8a|destroy]] them together: they have burned up all the [[#^note-8b|synagogues]] of God in the land. ^verse-8

**9**  We see not our signs: there is [[#^note-9a|no more]] any [[#^note-9b|prophet]]: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. ^verse-9

**10**  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy [[#^note-10a|blaspheme]] thy name for ever? ^verse-10

**11**  Why [[#^note-11a|withdrawest]] thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. ^verse-11

**12**  For God is my [[#^note-12a|King]] of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the [[#^note-13a|dragons]] in the waters. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou didst [[#^note-15a|cleave]] the fountain and the flood: thou [[#^note-15b|driedst]] up mighty rivers. ^verse-15

**16**  The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. ^verse-16

**17**  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made [[#^note-17a|summer]] and winter. ^verse-17

**18**  Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. ^verse-18

**19**  O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. ^verse-19

**20**  Have respect unto the [[#^note-20a|covenant]]: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of [[#^note-20b|cruelty]]. ^verse-20

**21**  O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. ^verse-21

**22**  Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. ^verse-22

**23**  Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. ^verse-23
