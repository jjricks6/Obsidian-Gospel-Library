*The righteous cry unto the Lordâ€”They remember the wonders of old, how He redeemed the sons of Jacob and led Israel like a flock.*

**1**  I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. ^verse-1

**2**  In the day of my trouble I [[#^note-2a|sought]] the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be [[#^note-2b|comforted]]. ^verse-2

**3**  I remembered God, and was troubled: I [[#^note-3a|complained]], and my spirit was [[#^note-3b|overwhelmed]]. Selah. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. ^verse-4

**5**  I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. ^verse-5

**6**  I call to remembrance my [[#^note-6a|song]] in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. ^verse-6

**7**  Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? ^verse-7

**8**  Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? ^verse-8

**9**  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. ^verse-9

**10**  And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. ^verse-10

**11**  I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. ^verse-11

**12**  I will [[#^note-12a|meditate]] also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. ^verse-12

**13**  Thy way, O God, is [[#^note-13a|in the sanctuary]]: who is so great a God as our God? ^verse-13

**14**  Thou art the God that doest [[#^note-14a|wonders]]: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. ^verse-14

**15**  Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and [[#^note-15a|Joseph]]. Selah. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|waters]] saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. ^verse-16

**17**  The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. ^verse-17

**18**  The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings [[#^note-18a|lightened]] the world: the earth trembled and shook. ^verse-18

**19**  Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou [[#^note-20a|leddest]] thy people like a flock by the hand of [[#^note-20b|Moses]] and Aaron. ^verse-20
