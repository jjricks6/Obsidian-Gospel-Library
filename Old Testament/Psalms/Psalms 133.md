### Psalm 133

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 132|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 134|Next Entry]]

*David says, It is pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity!*

**1**  Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for [[#^note-1a|brethren]] to dwell together in [[#^note-1b|unity]]! ^verse-1

**2**  It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the [[#^note-2a|skirts]] of his garments; ^verse-2

**3**  As the dew of [[#^note-3a|Hermon]], and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord [[#^note-3b|commanded]] the blessing, even life for evermore. ^verse-3
