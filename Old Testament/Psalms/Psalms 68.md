### Psalm 68

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 67|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 69|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—He extols Jah—The Lord gave the word—He takes captivity captive—He delivers us from death—Sing praises unto the Lord.*

**1**  Let God arise, let his enemies be [[#^note-1a|scattered]]: let them also that [[#^note-1b|hate]] him flee before him. ^verse-1

**2**  As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as [[#^note-2a|wax]] melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the [[#^note-2b|presence]] of God. ^verse-2

**3**  But let the [[#^note-3a|righteous]] be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. ^verse-3

**4**  Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name [[#^note-4a|Jah]], and rejoice before him. ^verse-4

**5**  A father of the [[#^note-5a|fatherless]], and a [[#^note-5b|judge]] of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. ^verse-5

**6**  God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the [[#^note-6a|rebellious]] dwell in a dry land. ^verse-6

**7**  O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst [[#^note-7a|march]] through the wilderness; Selah: ^verse-7

**8**  The earth shook, the heavens also [[#^note-8a|dropped]] at the presence of God: even [[#^note-8b|Sinai]] itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful [[#^note-9a|rain]], whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. ^verse-9

**10**  Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. ^verse-10

**11**  The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it. ^verse-11

**12**  Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. ^verse-12

**13**  Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. ^verse-13

**14**  When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon. ^verse-14

**15**  The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. ^verse-15

**16**  Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. ^verse-16

**17**  The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place. ^verse-17

**18**  Thou hast [[#^note-18a|ascended]] on high, thou hast led [[#^note-18b|captivity]] captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them. ^verse-18

**19**  Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah. ^verse-19

**20**  He that is our God is the God of [[#^note-20a|salvation]]; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from [[#^note-20b|death]]. ^verse-20

**21**  But God shall [[#^note-21a|wound]] the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. ^verse-21

**22**  The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea: ^verse-22

**23**  That thy foot may be dipped in the [[#^note-23a|blood]] of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same. ^verse-23

**24**  They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. ^verse-24

**25**  The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. ^verse-25

**26**  Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, [[#^note-26a|from]] the fountain of Israel. ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|There]] is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. ^verse-27

**28**  Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. ^verse-28

**29**  Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring [[#^note-29a|presents]] unto thee. ^verse-29

**30**  Rebuke the [[#^note-30a|company of spearmen]], the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. ^verse-30

**31**  Princes shall come out of [[#^note-31a|Egypt]]; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. ^verse-31

**32**  Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: ^verse-32

**33**  To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. ^verse-33

**34**  Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. ^verse-34

**35**  O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. ^verse-35
