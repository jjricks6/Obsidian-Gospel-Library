*David says, The fool has said in his heart, there is no Godâ€”Israel will rejoice in the day of restoration.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|The]] [[#^note-1b|fool]] hath said in his heart, There is [[#^note-1c|no]] [[#^note-1d|God]]. They are [[#^note-1e|corrupt]], they have done abominable works, there is [[#^note-1f|none]] that doeth good. ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. ^verse-2

**3**  They are all gone aside, they are all together become [[#^note-3a|filthy]]: there is [[#^note-3b|none]] that doeth good, no, not one. ^verse-3

**4**  Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. ^verse-5

**6**  Ye have [[#^note-6a|shamed]] the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge. ^verse-6

**7**  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth back the [[#^note-7a|captivity]] of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. ^verse-7
