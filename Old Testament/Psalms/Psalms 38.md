*A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.*

### Psalm 38

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 37|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 39|Next Entry]]

*David sorrows for his sins—They rest as a disease upon him—He asks the Lord to be compassionate.*

**1**  O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^verse-1

**2**  For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. ^verse-2

**3**  There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. ^verse-3

**4**  For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. ^verse-4

**5**  My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. ^verse-5

**6**  I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. ^verse-6

**7**  For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. ^verse-7

**8**  I am feeble and sore broken: I [[#^note-8a|have roared]] by reason of the disquietness of my heart. ^verse-8

**9**  Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. ^verse-9

**10**  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine [[#^note-10a|eyes]], it also is gone from me. ^verse-10

**11**  My [[#^note-11a|lovers and my friends]] stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. ^verse-11

**12**  They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine [[#^note-12a|deceits]] all the day long. ^verse-12

**13**  But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. ^verse-13

**14**  Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. ^verse-14

**15**  For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. ^verse-15

**16**  For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. ^verse-16

**17**  For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. ^verse-17

**18**  For I will [[#^note-18a|declare]] mine iniquity; I will be [[#^note-18b|sorry]] for my sin. ^verse-18

**19**  But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. ^verse-19

**20**  They also that [[#^note-20a|render]] evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. ^verse-20

**21**  Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me. ^verse-21

**22**  Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. ^verse-22
