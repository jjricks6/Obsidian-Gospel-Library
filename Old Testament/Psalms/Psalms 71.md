*David praises God with thanksgivingâ€”Who is like unto the Lord!*

**1**  In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. ^verse-1

**2**  Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me. ^verse-2

**3**  Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my [[#^note-3a|rock]] and my fortress. ^verse-3

**4**  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and [[#^note-4a|cruel]] man. ^verse-4

**5**  For thou art my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth. ^verse-5

**6**  By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee. ^verse-6

**7**  I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. ^verse-7

**8**  Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day. ^verse-8

**9**  Cast me not off in the time of [[#^note-9a|old]] age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. ^verse-9

**10**  For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, ^verse-10

**11**  Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. ^verse-11

**12**  O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. ^verse-12

**13**  Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with [[#^note-13a|reproach]] and dishonour that seek my hurt. ^verse-13

**14**  But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. ^verse-14

**15**  My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. ^verse-15

**16**  I will go in the [[#^note-16a|strength]] of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. ^verse-16

**17**  O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. ^verse-17

**18**  Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come. ^verse-18

**19**  Thy [[#^note-19a|righteousness]] also, O God, is very [[#^note-19b|high]], who hast done great things: O God, who is [[#^note-19c|like]] unto thee! ^verse-19

**20**  Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt [[#^note-20a|quicken]] me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou shalt increase my greatness, and [[#^note-21a|comfort]] me on every side. ^verse-21

**22**  I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. ^verse-22

**23**  My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. ^verse-23

**24**  My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto [[#^note-24a|shame]], that seek my hurt. ^verse-24
