### Psalm 131

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 130|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 132|Next Entry]]

*David says, Let Israel hope in the Lord forever.*

**1**  Lord, my heart is not [[#^note-1a|haughty]], nor mine [[#^note-1b|eyes]] lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. ^verse-1

**2**  Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. ^verse-2

**3**  Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever. ^verse-3
