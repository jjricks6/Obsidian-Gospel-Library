[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 62|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 64|Next Entry]]

*David thirsts for God, whom he praises with joyful lips.*

**1**  O God, thou art my God; [[#^note-1a|early]] will I seek thee: my soul [[#^note-1b|thirsteth]] for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and [[#^note-1c|thirsty]] land, where no water is; ^verse-1

**2**  To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. ^verse-2

**3**  Because thy lovingkindness is [[#^note-3a|better]] than life, my lips shall praise thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my [[#^note-4a|hands]] in thy name. ^verse-4

**5**  My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: ^verse-5

**6**  When I remember thee upon my [[#^note-6a|bed]], and [[#^note-6b|meditate]] on thee in the night watches. ^verse-6

**7**  Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. ^verse-7

**8**  My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. ^verse-8

**9**  But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for [[#^note-10a|foxes]]. ^verse-10

**11**  But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. ^verse-11
