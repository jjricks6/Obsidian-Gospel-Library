*Blessed are they who trust in the Lordâ€”Peace will be upon Israel.*

**1**  They that [[#^note-1a|trust]] in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but [[#^note-1b|abideth]] for ever. ^verse-1

**2**  As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. ^verse-2

**3**  For the rod of the [[#^note-3a|wicked]] shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. ^verse-3

**4**  Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. ^verse-4

**5**  As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but [[#^note-5a|peace]] shall be upon Israel. ^verse-5
