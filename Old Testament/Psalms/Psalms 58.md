*To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David.*

### Psalm 58

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 57|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 59|Next Entry]]

*David reproves wicked judgesâ€”They go astray and speak lies.*

**1**  Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye [[#^note-1a|judge]] uprightly, O ye sons of men? ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. ^verse-2

**3**  The wicked are estranged from the [[#^note-3a|womb]]: they go [[#^note-3b|astray]] as soon as they be born, speaking lies. ^verse-3

**4**  Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; ^verse-4

**5**  Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. ^verse-5

**6**  Break their [[#^note-6a|teeth]], O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. ^verse-7

**8**  As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. ^verse-8

**9**  Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. ^verse-9

**10**  The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the [[#^note-10a|blood]] of the wicked. ^verse-10

**11**  So that a man shall say, Verily there is a [[#^note-11a|reward]] for the righteous: verily he is a God that [[#^note-11b|judgeth]] in the earth. ^verse-11
