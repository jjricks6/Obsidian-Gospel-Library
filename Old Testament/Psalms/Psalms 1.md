### Psalm 1

[[Old Testament/Psalms|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 2|Next Entry]]

*Blessed are the righteousâ€”The ungodly will perish.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Blessed]] is the man that [[#^note-1b|walketh]] not in the [[#^note-1c|counsel]] of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the [[#^note-1d|scornful]]. ^verse-1

**2**  But his [[#^note-2a|delight]] is in the [[#^note-2b|law]] of the Lord; and in his law doth he [[#^note-2c|meditate]] day and night. ^verse-2

**3**  And he shall be like a [[#^note-3a|tree]] planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall [[#^note-3b|prosper]]. ^verse-3

**4**  The ungodly are not so: but are like the [[#^note-4a|chaff]] which the wind driveth away. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. ^verse-5

**6**  For the Lord knoweth the way of the [[#^note-6a|righteous]]: but the way of the [[#^note-6b|ungodly]] shall perish. ^verse-6
