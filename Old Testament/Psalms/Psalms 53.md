*To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 53

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 52|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 54|Next Entry]]

*David says, The fool says there is no God—There is none who does good—Gathered Israel will rejoice.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|fool]] hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is [[#^note-1b|none]] that doeth good. ^verse-1

**2**  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. ^verse-2

**3**  Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. ^verse-3

**4**  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God. ^verse-4

**5**  There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath [[#^note-5a|scattered]] the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath [[#^note-5b|despised]] them. ^verse-5

**6**  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God [[#^note-6a|bringeth]] back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. ^verse-6
