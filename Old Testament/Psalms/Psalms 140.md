[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 139|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 141|Next Entry]]

*David prays for deliverance from his enemiesâ€”The Lord maintains the cause of the poor and afflicted.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Deliver]] me, O Lord, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; ^verse-1

**2**  Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war. ^verse-2

**3**  They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' [[#^note-3a|poison]] is under their lips. Selah. ^verse-3

**4**  Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. ^verse-4

**5**  The proud have hid a [[#^note-5a|snare]] for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set [[#^note-5b|gins]] for me. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. ^verse-7

**8**  Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. ^verse-9

**10**  Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. ^verse-10

**11**  Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. ^verse-11

**12**  I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor. ^verse-12

**13**  Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy [[#^note-13a|presence]]. ^verse-13
