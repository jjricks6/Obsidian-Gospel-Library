[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 87|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 89|Next Entry]]

*A prayer of one who feels forsaken and who asks whether the Lord's loving kindness will be declared in the grave.*

**1**  O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: ^verse-1

**2**  Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; ^verse-2

**3**  For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. ^verse-3

**4**  I am counted with them that go down into the [[#^note-4a|pit]]: I am as a man that hath no strength: ^verse-4

**5**  Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou [[#^note-5a|rememberest]] no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. ^verse-6

**7**  Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. ^verse-8

**9**  Mine [[#^note-9a|eye]] mourneth by reason of [[#^note-9b|affliction]]: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. ^verse-9

**10**  Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah. ^verse-10

**11**  Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? ^verse-11

**12**  Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? ^verse-12

**13**  But unto thee have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer [[#^note-13a|prevent thee]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Lord, why castest thou off my soul? why [[#^note-14a|hidest]] thou thy face from me? ^verse-14

**15**  I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. ^verse-15

**16**  Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. ^verse-16

**17**  They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. ^verse-17

**18**  Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. ^verse-18
