[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 96|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 98|Next Entry]]

*The Lord reigns in millennial glory—The hills melt at His presence—Those who love the Lord hate evil.*

**1**  The Lord [[#^note-1a|reigneth]]; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. ^verse-1

**2**  Clouds and [[#^note-2a|darkness]] are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. ^verse-2

**3**  A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. ^verse-3

**4**  His lightnings [[#^note-4a|enlightened]] the world: the earth saw, and trembled. ^verse-4

**5**  The hills [[#^note-5a|melted]] like [[#^note-5b|wax]] at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. ^verse-5

**6**  The heavens [[#^note-6a|declare]] his [[#^note-6b|righteousness]], and all the people see his glory. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Confounded]] be all they that serve graven [[#^note-7b|images]], that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. ^verse-7

**8**  Zion heard, and was glad; and the [[#^note-8a|daughters]] of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  For thou, Lord, art [[#^note-9a|high]] above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. ^verse-9

**10**  Ye that love the Lord, [[#^note-10a|hate]] [[#^note-10b|evil]]: he [[#^note-10c|preserveth]] the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Light]] is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Rejoice]] in the Lord, ye righteous; and give [[#^note-12b|thanks]] at the remembrance of his holiness. ^verse-12
