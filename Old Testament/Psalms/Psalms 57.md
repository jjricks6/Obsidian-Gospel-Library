### Psalm 57

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 56|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 58|Next Entry]]

*David pleads for mercy and acclaims the glory and exaltation of God.*

**1**  Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy [[#^note-1a|wings]] will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. ^verse-1

**2**  I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me. ^verse-2

**3**  He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. ^verse-3

**4**  My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose [[#^note-4a|teeth]] are spears and arrows, and their [[#^note-4b|tongue]] a sharp [[#^note-4c|sword]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth. ^verse-5

**6**  They have prepared a [[#^note-6a|net]] for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have [[#^note-6b|digged]] a [[#^note-6c|pit]] before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah. ^verse-6

**7**  My heart is [[#^note-7a|fixed]], O God, my heart is fixed: I will [[#^note-7b|sing]] and give praise. ^verse-7

**8**  Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. ^verse-8

**9**  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. ^verse-9

**10**  For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. ^verse-10

**11**  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. ^verse-11
