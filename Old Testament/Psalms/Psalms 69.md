*To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 69

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 68|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 70|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of David—The zeal of the Lord's house has eaten Him up—Reproach has broken His heart—He is given gall and vinegar to drink—He is persecuted—He will save Zion.*

**1**  Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. ^verse-1

**2**  I sink in [[#^note-2a|deep]] mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. ^verse-2

**3**  I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. ^verse-3

**4**  They that [[#^note-4a|hate]] me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. ^verse-4

**5**  O God, thou knowest my [[#^note-5a|foolishness]]; and my sins are not hid from thee. ^verse-5

**6**  Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. ^verse-7

**8**  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. ^verse-8

**9**  For the [[#^note-9a|zeal]] of thine house hath eaten me up; and the [[#^note-9b|reproaches]] of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. ^verse-9

**10**  When I wept, and chastened my soul with [[#^note-10a|fasting]], that was to my reproach. ^verse-10

**11**  I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. ^verse-11

**12**  They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the [[#^note-12a|song]] of the drunkards. ^verse-12

**13**  But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. ^verse-13

**14**  Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. ^verse-14

**15**  Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the [[#^note-15a|pit]] shut her mouth upon me. ^verse-15

**16**  Hear me, O Lord; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender [[#^note-16a|mercies]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. ^verse-17

**18**  Draw [[#^note-18a|nigh]] unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou hast known my [[#^note-19a|reproach]], and my [[#^note-19b|shame]], and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. ^verse-19

**20**  Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of [[#^note-20a|heaviness]]: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. ^verse-20

**21**  They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me [[#^note-21a|vinegar]] to drink. ^verse-21

**22**  Let their table become a [[#^note-22a|snare]] before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. ^verse-22

**23**  Let their eyes be darkened, that they [[#^note-23a|see not]]; and make their loins continually to shake. ^verse-23

**24**  Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. ^verse-24

**25**  Let their habitation be [[#^note-25a|desolate]]; and let none dwell in their tents. ^verse-25

**26**  For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. ^verse-26

**27**  Add [[#^note-27a|iniquity]] unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. ^verse-27

**28**  Let them be blotted out of the [[#^note-28a|book]] of the living, and not be written with the righteous. ^verse-28

**29**  But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. ^verse-29

**30**  I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with [[#^note-30a|thanksgiving]]. ^verse-30

**31**  This also shall [[#^note-31a|please]] the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs. ^verse-31

**32**  The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that [[#^note-32a|seek]] God. ^verse-32

**33**  For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not [[#^note-33a|his prisoners]]. ^verse-33

**34**  Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. ^verse-34

**35**  For God will save [[#^note-35a|Zion]], and will [[#^note-35b|build]] the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. ^verse-35

**36**  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein. ^verse-36
