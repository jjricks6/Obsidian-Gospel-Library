### Psalm 85

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 84|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 86|Next Entry]]

*The Lord speaks peace to His peopleâ€”Truth will spring out of the earth (the Book of Mormon), and righteousness will look down from heaven.*

**1**  Lord, thou hast been [[#^note-1a|favourable]] unto thy land: thou hast brought back [[#^note-1b|the captivity of Jacob]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. ^verse-3

**4**  Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine [[#^note-4a|anger]] toward us to cease. ^verse-4

**5**  Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? ^verse-5

**6**  Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? ^verse-6

**7**  Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. ^verse-7

**8**  I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak [[#^note-8a|peace]] unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn [[#^note-8b|again]] to folly. ^verse-8

**9**  Surely his [[#^note-9a|salvation]] is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. ^verse-9

**10**  Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Truth]] shall spring out of the [[#^note-11b|earth]]; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, the Lord shall give that which is [[#^note-12a|good]]; and our land shall yield her increase. ^verse-12

**13**  Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps. ^verse-13
