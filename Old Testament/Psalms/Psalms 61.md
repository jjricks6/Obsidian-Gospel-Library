*David finds shelter in the Lord, abides in the Lord's presence, and keeps his own vows.*

**1**  Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. ^verse-1

**2**  From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the [[#^note-2a|rock]] that is higher than I. ^verse-2

**3**  For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong [[#^note-3a|tower]] from the enemy. ^verse-3

**4**  I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  For thou, O God, hast heard my [[#^note-5a|vows]]: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. ^verse-6

**7**  He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare [[#^note-7a|mercy]] and truth, which may preserve him. ^verse-7

**8**  So will I sing [[#^note-8a|praise]] unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. ^verse-8
