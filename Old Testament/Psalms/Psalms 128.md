*Blessed are those who fear the Lord and walk in His ways.*

**1**  Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that [[#^note-1a|walketh]] in his ways. ^verse-1

**2**  For thou shalt [[#^note-2a|eat]] the [[#^note-2b|labour]] of thine hands: [[#^note-2c|happy]] shalt thou be, and it shall be [[#^note-2d|well]] with thee. ^verse-2

**3**  Thy [[#^note-3a|wife]] shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord shall [[#^note-5a|bless]] thee out of [[#^note-5b|Zion]]: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. ^verse-5

**6**  Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and [[#^note-6a|peace]] upon Israel. ^verse-6
