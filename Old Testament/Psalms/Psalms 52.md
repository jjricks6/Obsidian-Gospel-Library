*David says that wicked tongues devise mischief and the wicked trust in richesâ€”The Saints trust in the mercy of God forever.*

**1**  Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually. ^verse-1

**2**  Thy [[#^note-2a|tongue]] deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. ^verse-4

**5**  God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and [[#^note-5a|pluck]] thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall [[#^note-6a|laugh]] at him: ^verse-6

**7**  Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness. ^verse-7

**8**  But I am like a [[#^note-8a|green olive tree]] in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. ^verse-8

**9**  I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints. ^verse-9
