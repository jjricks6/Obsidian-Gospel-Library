*The Lord governs the sea and the land for the blessing of His people.*

**1**  When Israel went out of [[#^note-1a|Egypt]], the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; ^verse-1

**2**  Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. ^verse-2

**3**  The sea saw it, and [[#^note-3a|fled]]: Jordan was driven back. ^verse-3

**4**  The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. ^verse-4

**5**  What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? ^verse-5

**6**  Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? ^verse-6

**7**  Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; ^verse-7

**8**  Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of [[#^note-8a|waters]]. ^verse-8
