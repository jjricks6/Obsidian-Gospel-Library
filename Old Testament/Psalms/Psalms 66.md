[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 65|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 67|Next Entry]]

*Praise and worship the Lord—He tests and tries men—Sacrifices are to be offered in His house.*

**1**  Make a [[#^note-1a|joyful]] noise unto God, all ye lands: ^verse-1

**2**  Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. ^verse-2

**3**  Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies [[#^note-3a|submit]] themselves unto thee. ^verse-3

**4**  All the earth shall [[#^note-4a|worship]] thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. ^verse-5

**6**  He turned the [[#^note-6a|sea]] into dry land: they went through the [[#^note-6b|flood]] on foot: there did we rejoice in him. ^verse-6

**7**  He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: ^verse-8

**9**  Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our [[#^note-9a|feet]] to [[#^note-9b|be moved]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For thou, O God, hast [[#^note-10a|proved]] us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst [[#^note-11a|affliction]] upon our loins. ^verse-11

**12**  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through [[#^note-12a|water]]: but thou [[#^note-12b|broughtest]] us out into a [[#^note-12c|wealthy]] place. ^verse-12

**13**  I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, ^verse-13

**14**  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. ^verse-14

**15**  I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. ^verse-15

**16**  Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. ^verse-16

**17**  I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. ^verse-17

**18**  If I regard iniquity in my [[#^note-18a|hear]]t, the Lord will not hear me: ^verse-18

**19**  But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. ^verse-19

**20**  Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. ^verse-20
