### Psalm 90

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 89|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 91|Next Entry]]

*A prayer of Moses, the man of God—God is from everlasting to everlasting—Man's days last but seventy years—Moses implores the Lord to give mercy and blessings to His people.*

**1**  Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. ^verse-1

**2**  Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst [[#^note-2a|formed]] the earth and the world, even from [[#^note-2b|everlasting]] to everlasting, thou art God. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou [[#^note-3a|turnest man to destruction]]; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. ^verse-3

**4**  For a thousand [[#^note-4a|years]] in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like [[#^note-5a|grass]] which groweth up. ^verse-5

**6**  In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. ^verse-6

**7**  For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou hast set our [[#^note-8a|iniquities]] before thee, our [[#^note-8b|secret]] sins in the light of thy countenance. ^verse-8

**9**  For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. ^verse-9

**10**  The [[#^note-10a|days of our years]] are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. ^verse-10

**11**  Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. ^verse-11

**12**  So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. ^verse-12

**13**  Return, O Lord, how long? and [[#^note-13a|let it repent thee]] concerning thy servants. ^verse-13

**14**  O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. ^verse-14

**15**  Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. ^verse-15

**16**  Let thy [[#^note-16a|work]] appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. ^verse-16

**17**  And let the [[#^note-17a|beauty]] of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. ^verse-17
