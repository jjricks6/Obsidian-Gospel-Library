[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 80|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 82|Next Entry]]

*Israel is commanded to sing praises to Godâ€”If the Israelites had walked in the Lord's ways, they would have triumphed over their enemies.*

**1**  Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. ^verse-1

**2**  Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. ^verse-2

**3**  Blow up the [[#^note-3a|trumpet]] in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. ^verse-3

**4**  For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. ^verse-4

**5**  This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a [[#^note-5a|language]] that I understood not. ^verse-5

**6**  I removed his shoulder from the [[#^note-6a|burden]]: his hands were delivered from the pots. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou calledst in [[#^note-7a|trouble]], and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret [[#^note-7b|place]] of thunder: I [[#^note-7c|proved]] thee at the waters of [[#^note-7d|Meribah]]. Selah. ^verse-7

**8**  Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; ^verse-8

**9**  There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. ^verse-9

**10**  I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. ^verse-10

**11**  But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. ^verse-11

**12**  So I [[#^note-12a|gave]] them up unto their own hearts' [[#^note-12b|lust]]: and they walked in their own counsels. ^verse-12

**13**  Oh that my people had [[#^note-13a|hearkened]] unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! ^verse-13

**14**  I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. ^verse-14

**15**  The haters of the Lord should have [[#^note-15a|submitted]] themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. ^verse-15

**16**  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. ^verse-16
