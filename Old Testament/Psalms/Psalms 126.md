*The Lord has done great things for His people, Israel.*

**1**  When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. ^verse-1

**2**  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath [[#^note-2a|done]] great [[#^note-2b|things]] for them. ^verse-2

**3**  The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Turn again]] our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. ^verse-4

**5**  They that sow in tears shall reap in [[#^note-5a|joy]]. ^verse-5

**6**  He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious [[#^note-6a|seed]], shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his [[#^note-6b|sheaves]] with him. ^verse-6
