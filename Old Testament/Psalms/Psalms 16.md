*Michtam of David.*

### Psalm 16

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 17|Next Entry]]

*A messianic psalm of Davidâ€”He rejoices in the Saints who are on the earth, in his own future redemption from hell, in the fact that God will not suffer His Holy One (the Messiah) to see corruption, and in the fulness of joy that is found in the Lord's presence.*

**1**  Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my [[#^note-1a|trust]]. ^verse-1

**2**  O [[#^note-2a|my]] soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; ^verse-2

**3**  But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. ^verse-3

**4**  Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another [[#^note-4a|god]]: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord is the [[#^note-5a|portion]] of mine [[#^note-5b|inheritance]] and of my cup: thou [[#^note-5c|maintainest my lot]]. ^verse-5

**6**  The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. ^verse-6

**7**  I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. ^verse-7

**8**  I have set the [[#^note-8a|Lord]] always before me: because he is at my [[#^note-8b|right hand]], I shall not be moved. ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my [[#^note-9a|flesh]] also shall rest in hope. ^verse-9

**10**  For thou wilt not [[#^note-10a|leave]] my [[#^note-10b|soul]] in [[#^note-10c|hell]]; neither wilt thou suffer thine [[#^note-10d|Holy One]] to see corruption. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy [[#^note-11a|presence]] is [[#^note-11b|fulness]] of [[#^note-11c|joy]]; at thy right hand there are [[#^note-11d|pleasures]] for evermore. ^verse-11
