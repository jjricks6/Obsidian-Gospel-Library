### Psalm 4

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 5|Next Entry]]

*David pleads for mercyâ€”He counsels, Put your trust in the Lord.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Hear]] me when I call, O God of my [[#^note-1b|righteousness]]: thou hast enlarged me when I was in [[#^note-1c|distress]]; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. ^verse-1

**2**  O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into [[#^note-2a|shame]]? how long will ye love [[#^note-2b|vanity]], and seek after leasing? Selah. ^verse-2

**3**  But know that the Lord hath [[#^note-3a|set apart]] him that is [[#^note-3b|godly]] for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him. ^verse-3

**4**  Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. ^verse-4

**5**  Offer the [[#^note-5a|sacrifices]] of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy [[#^note-6a|countenance]] upon us. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their [[#^note-7a|corn]] and their wine increased. ^verse-7

**8**  I will both lay me down in [[#^note-8a|peace]], and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety. ^verse-8
