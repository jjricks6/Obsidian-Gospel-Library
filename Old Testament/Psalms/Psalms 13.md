[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 14|Next Entry]]

*David trusts in the Lord's mercy and rejoices in His salvation.*

**1**  How long wilt thou [[#^note-1a|forget]] me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou [[#^note-1b|hide]] thy face from me? ^verse-1

**2**  How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having [[#^note-2a|sorrow]] in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? ^verse-2

**3**  Consider and [[#^note-3a|hear]] me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; ^verse-3

**4**  Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. ^verse-4

**5**  But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy [[#^note-5a|salvation]]. ^verse-5

**6**  I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. ^verse-6
