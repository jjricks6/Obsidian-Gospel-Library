### Psalm 17

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 16|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 18|Next Entry]]

*David pleads with the Lord to hear his voice and to preserve him from men of the worldâ€”David hopes to behold the Lord's face in righteousness.*

**1**  Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. ^verse-1

**2**  Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou hast [[#^note-3a|proved]] mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. ^verse-3

**4**  Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Hold]] up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. ^verse-5

**6**  I have called upon thee, for thou wilt [[#^note-6a|hear]] me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. ^verse-6

**7**  Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. ^verse-7

**8**  Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, ^verse-8

**9**  From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. ^verse-9

**10**  They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. ^verse-10

**11**  They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes [[#^note-11a|bowing]] down to the earth; ^verse-11

**12**  Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. ^verse-12

**13**  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, [[#^note-13a|which is]] thy sword: ^verse-13

**14**  From men [[#^note-14a|which are]] thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their [[#^note-14b|portion]] in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. ^verse-14

**15**  As for me, I will behold thy face in [[#^note-15a|righteousness]]: I shall be satisfied, when I [[#^note-15b|awake]], with thy likeness. ^verse-15
