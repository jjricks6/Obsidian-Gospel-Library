*To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.*

### Psalm 39

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 38|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 40|Next Entry]]

*David seeks to control his tongue—Man is altogether vanity—He is a stranger and a sojourner on the earth.*

**1**  I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my [[#^note-1a|tongue]]: I will keep my [[#^note-1b|mouth]] with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. ^verse-1

**2**  I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred. ^verse-2

**3**  My heart was [[#^note-3a|hot]] within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue, ^verse-3

**4**  Lord, make me to know mine end, and the [[#^note-4a|measure]] of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether [[#^note-5a|vanity]]. Selah. ^verse-5

**6**  Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up [[#^note-6a|riches]], and knoweth not who shall gather them. ^verse-6

**7**  And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Deliver]] me from all my [[#^note-8b|transgressions]]: make me not the reproach of the foolish. ^verse-8

**9**  I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. ^verse-9

**10**  Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. ^verse-10

**11**  When thou with rebukes dost [[#^note-11a|correct]] man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is [[#^note-11b|vanity]]. Selah. ^verse-11

**12**  Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a [[#^note-12a|stranger]] with thee, and a [[#^note-12b|sojourner]], as all my fathers were. ^verse-12

**13**  O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. ^verse-13
