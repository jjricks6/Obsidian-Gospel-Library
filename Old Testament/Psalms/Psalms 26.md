### Psalm 26

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 27|Next Entry]]

*David says that he has walked in integrity and obedienceâ€”He loves the Lord's house.*

**1**  Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have [[#^note-1a|trusted]] also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide. ^verse-1

**2**  Examine me, O Lord, and [[#^note-2a|prove]] me; try my reins and my heart. ^verse-2

**3**  For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. ^verse-3

**4**  I have not sat with [[#^note-4a|vain]] persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. ^verse-4

**5**  I have [[#^note-5a|hated]] the congregation of [[#^note-5b|evil]] doers; and will not sit with the wicked. ^verse-5

**6**  I will [[#^note-6a|wash]] mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Lord: ^verse-6

**7**  That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy [[#^note-7a|wondrous]] works. ^verse-7

**8**  Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine [[#^note-8a|honour]] dwelleth. ^verse-8

**9**  Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with [[#^note-9a|bloody]] men: ^verse-9

**10**  In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of [[#^note-10a|bribes]]. ^verse-10

**11**  But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. ^verse-11

**12**  My foot standeth in an even place: in the [[#^note-12a|congregations]] will I bless the Lord. ^verse-12
