[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 118|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 120|Next Entry]]

*Blessed are they who keep the commandments.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Blessed]] are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that [[#^note-2a|seek]] him with the whole heart. ^verse-2

**3**  They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts [[#^note-4a|diligently]]. ^verse-4

**5**  O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! ^verse-5

**6**  Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. ^verse-6

**7**  I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. ^verse-7

**8**  I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherewithal shall a young man [[#^note-9a|cleanse]] his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. ^verse-9

**10**  With my whole [[#^note-10a|heart]] have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. ^verse-10

**11**  Thy [[#^note-11a|word]] have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. ^verse-11

**12**  Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes. ^verse-12

**13**  With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. ^verse-13

**14**  I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. ^verse-14

**15**  I will [[#^note-15a|meditate]] in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. ^verse-15

**16**  I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. ^verse-16

**17**  Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. ^verse-17

**18**  Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. ^verse-18

**19**  I am a [[#^note-19a|stranger]] in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me. ^verse-19

**20**  My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments. ^verse-21

**22**  Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. ^verse-22

**23**  Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. ^verse-23

**24**  Thy [[#^note-24a|testimonies]] also are my delight and my counsellors. ^verse-24

**25**  My soul cleaveth unto the [[#^note-25a|dust]]: [[#^note-25b|quicken]] thou me according to thy word. ^verse-25

**26**  I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. ^verse-26

**27**  Make me to [[#^note-27a|understand]] the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. ^verse-27

**28**  My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy [[#^note-28a|word]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. ^verse-29

**30**  I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. ^verse-30

**31**  I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame. ^verse-31

**32**  I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt [[#^note-32a|enlarge]] my [[#^note-32b|heart]]. ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|Teach]] me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. ^verse-33

**34**  Give me [[#^note-34a|understanding]], and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. ^verse-34

**35**  Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I [[#^note-35a|delight]]. ^verse-35

**36**  Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to [[#^note-36a|covetousness]]. ^verse-36

**37**  Turn away mine eyes from beholding [[#^note-37a|vanity]]; and quicken thou me in thy way. ^verse-37

**38**  [[#^note-38a|Stablish]] thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. ^verse-38

**39**  Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy [[#^note-39a|judgments]] are good. ^verse-39

**40**  Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. ^verse-40

**41**  Let thy mercies come also unto me, O Lord, even thy salvation, according to thy word. ^verse-41

**42**  So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. ^verse-42

**43**  And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. ^verse-43

**44**  So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. ^verse-44

**45**  And I will walk at [[#^note-45a|liberty]]: for I seek thy precepts. ^verse-45

**46**  I will speak of thy testimonies also before [[#^note-46a|kings]], and will not be [[#^note-46b|ashamed]]. ^verse-46

**47**  And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. ^verse-47

**48**  My [[#^note-48a|hands]] also will I [[#^note-48b|lift up]] unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. ^verse-48

**49**  Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. ^verse-49

**50**  This is my [[#^note-50a|comfort]] in my [[#^note-50b|affliction]]: for thy word hath quickened me. ^verse-50

**51**  The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. ^verse-51

**52**  I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord; and have comforted myself. ^verse-52

**53**  [[#^note-53a|Horror]] hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. ^verse-53

**54**  Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my [[#^note-54a|pilgrimage]]. ^verse-54

**55**  I have [[#^note-55a|remembered]] thy name, O Lord, in the [[#^note-55b|night]], and have kept thy law. ^verse-55

**56**  This I had, because I kept thy precepts. ^verse-56

**57**  Thou art my [[#^note-57a|portion]], O Lord: I have said that I would keep thy words. ^verse-57

**58**  I entreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. ^verse-58

**59**  I [[#^note-59a|thought]] on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. ^verse-59

**60**  I made haste, and [[#^note-60a|delayed]] not to keep thy commandments. ^verse-60

**61**  The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. ^verse-61

**62**  At [[#^note-62a|midnight]] I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. ^verse-62

**63**  I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. ^verse-63

**64**  The earth, O Lord, is [[#^note-64a|full]] of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. ^verse-64

**65**  Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, according unto thy word. ^verse-65

**66**  Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. ^verse-66

**67**  [[#^note-67a|Before]] I was [[#^note-67b|afflicted]] I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. ^verse-67

**68**  Thou art [[#^note-68a|good]], and doest good; teach me thy statutes. ^verse-68

**69**  The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. ^verse-69

**70**  Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. ^verse-70

**71**  It is good for me that I have been [[#^note-71a|afflicted]]; that I might [[#^note-71b|learn]] thy statutes. ^verse-71

**72**  The law of thy mouth is better unto me than [[#^note-72a|thousands]] of [[#^note-72b|gold]] and silver. ^verse-72

**73**  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. ^verse-73

**74**  They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. ^verse-74

**75**  I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. ^verse-75

**76**  Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. ^verse-76

**77**  Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. ^verse-77

**78**  Let the proud be [[#^note-78a|ashamed]]; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. ^verse-78

**79**  Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. ^verse-79

**80**  Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. ^verse-80

**81**  My soul [[#^note-81a|fainteth]] for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. ^verse-81

**82**  Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? ^verse-82

**83**  For I am become like a [[#^note-83a|bottle]] in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. ^verse-83

**84**  How [[#^note-84a|many]] are [[#^note-84b|the days]] of thy servant? when wilt thou execute [[#^note-84c|judgment]] on them that persecute me? ^verse-84

**85**  The proud have [[#^note-85a|digged]] pits for me, which are not after thy law. ^verse-85

**86**  All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. ^verse-86

**87**  They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. ^verse-87

**88**  Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. ^verse-88

**89**  For ever, O Lord, thy [[#^note-89a|word]] is settled in heaven. ^verse-89

**90**  Thy [[#^note-90a|faithfulness]] is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. ^verse-90

**91**  They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. ^verse-91

**92**  Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. ^verse-92

**93**  I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. ^verse-93

**94**  I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. ^verse-94

**95**  The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. ^verse-95

**96**  I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad. ^verse-96

**97**  O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. ^verse-97

**98**  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. ^verse-98

**99**  I have more [[#^note-99a|understanding]] than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my [[#^note-99b|meditation]]. ^verse-99

**100**  I understand more than the [[#^note-100a|ancients]], because I keep thy precepts. ^verse-100

**101**  I have [[#^note-101a|refrained]] my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. ^verse-101

**102**  I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. ^verse-102

**103**  How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! ^verse-103

**104**  Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. ^verse-104

**105**  Thy [[#^note-105a|word]] is a [[#^note-105b|lamp]] unto my feet, and a [[#^note-105c|light]] unto my path. ^verse-105

**106**  I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous [[#^note-106a|judgments]]. ^verse-106

**107**  I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word. ^verse-107

**108**  Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill [[#^note-108a|offerings]] of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me thy judgments. ^verse-108

**109**  My [[#^note-109a|soul]] is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. ^verse-109

**110**  The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. ^verse-110

**111**  Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the [[#^note-111a|rejoicing]] of my heart. ^verse-111

**112**  I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end. ^verse-112

**113**  I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. ^verse-113

**114**  Thou art my [[#^note-114a|hiding place]] and my shield: I hope in thy word. ^verse-114

**115**  [[#^note-115a|Depart]] from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. ^verse-115

**116**  Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my [[#^note-116a|hope]]. ^verse-116

**117**  Hold thou me up, and I shall be [[#^note-117a|safe]]: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. ^verse-117

**118**  Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. ^verse-118

**119**  Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like [[#^note-119a|dross]]: therefore I love thy testimonies. ^verse-119

**120**  My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. ^verse-120

**121**  I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. ^verse-121

**122**  Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. ^verse-122

**123**  Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. ^verse-123

**124**  Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. ^verse-124

**125**  I am thy [[#^note-125a|servant]]; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. ^verse-125

**126**  It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law. ^verse-126

**127**  Therefore I [[#^note-127a|love]] thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. ^verse-127

**128**  Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. ^verse-128

**129**  Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. ^verse-129

**130**  The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth [[#^note-130a|understanding]] unto the simple. ^verse-130

**131**  I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. ^verse-131

**132**  Look thou upon me, and be [[#^note-132a|merciful]] unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. ^verse-132

**133**  [[#^note-133a|Order]] my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have [[#^note-133b|dominion]] over me. ^verse-133

**134**  Deliver me from the [[#^note-134a|oppression]] of man: so will I keep thy precepts. ^verse-134

**135**  Make thy face to [[#^note-135a|shine]] upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. ^verse-135

**136**  Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. ^verse-136

**137**  [[#^note-137a|Righteous]] art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments. ^verse-137

**138**  Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are [[#^note-138a|righteous]] and very faithful. ^verse-138

**139**  My [[#^note-139a|zeal]] hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. ^verse-139

**140**  Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. ^verse-140

**141**  I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. ^verse-141

**142**  Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the [[#^note-142a|truth]]. ^verse-142

**143**  Trouble and [[#^note-143a|anguish]] have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights. ^verse-143

**144**  The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live. ^verse-144

**145**  I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I will keep thy statutes. ^verse-145

**146**  I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. ^verse-146

**147**  [[#^note-147a|I]] prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. ^verse-147

**148**  [[#^note-148a|Mine]] eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. ^verse-148

**149**  Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O Lord, quicken me according to thy judgment. ^verse-149

**150**  They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. ^verse-150

**151**  Thou art [[#^note-151a|near]], O Lord; and all thy commandments are truth. ^verse-151

**152**  Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. ^verse-152

**153**  Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. ^verse-153

**154**  Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. ^verse-154

**155**  Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. ^verse-155

**156**  Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to thy judgments. ^verse-156

**157**  Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. ^verse-157

**158**  I beheld the transgressors, and was [[#^note-158a|grieved]]; because they kept not thy word. ^verse-158

**159**  Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness. ^verse-159

**160**  Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. ^verse-160

**161**  Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. ^verse-161

**162**  I [[#^note-162a|rejoice]] at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. ^verse-162

**163**  I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. ^verse-163

**164**  Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. ^verse-164

**165**  Great [[#^note-165a|peace]] have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. ^verse-165

**166**  Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. ^verse-166

**167**  My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. ^verse-167

**168**  I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my [[#^note-168a|ways]] are before thee. ^verse-168

**169**  Let my cry come near before thee, O Lord: give me [[#^note-169a|understanding]] according to thy word. ^verse-169

**170**  Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. ^verse-170

**171**  My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. ^verse-171

**172**  My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness. ^verse-172

**173**  Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. ^verse-173

**174**  I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my delight. ^verse-174

**175**  Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. ^verse-175

**176**  I have gone astray like a lost [[#^note-176a|sheep]]; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments. ^verse-176
