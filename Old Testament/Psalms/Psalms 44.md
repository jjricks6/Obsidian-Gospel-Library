*To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.*

### Psalm 44

[[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 43|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Psalms/Psalms 45|Next Entry]]

*The Saints praise the Lord and boast in His name foreverâ€”They are persecuted, maligned, and considered as sheep for the slaughter.*

**1**  We have heard with our ears, O God, our [[#^note-1a|fathers]] have [[#^note-1b|told]] us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. ^verse-1

**2**  How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. ^verse-2

**3**  For they got not the [[#^note-3a|land]] in possession by their own [[#^note-3b|sword]], neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou art my [[#^note-4a|King]], O God: command deliverances for Jacob. ^verse-4

**5**  Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. ^verse-5

**6**  For I will not [[#^note-6a|trust]] in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. ^verse-6

**7**  But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. ^verse-7

**8**  In God we [[#^note-8a|boast]] all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. ^verse-8

**9**  But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. ^verse-10

**11**  Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast [[#^note-11a|scattered]] us among the heathen. ^verse-11

**12**  Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou makest us a [[#^note-13a|reproach]] to our neighbours, a scorn and a [[#^note-13b|derision]] to them that are round about us. ^verse-13

**14**  Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. ^verse-14

**15**  My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, ^verse-15

**16**  For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. ^verse-16

**17**  All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. ^verse-17

**18**  Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; ^verse-18

**19**  Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of [[#^note-19a|dragons]], and covered us with the [[#^note-19b|shadow of death]]. ^verse-19

**20**  If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; ^verse-20

**21**  Shall not God search this out? for he [[#^note-21a|knoweth]] the secrets of the heart. ^verse-21

**22**  Yea, for thy sake are we [[#^note-22a|killed]] all the day long; we are counted as [[#^note-22b|sheep]] for the slaughter. ^verse-22

**23**  Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? ^verse-24

**25**  For our soul is bowed down to the [[#^note-25a|dust]]: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. ^verse-25

**26**  Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake. ^verse-26
