*The children of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) receive their inheritances—Some Canaanites continue to dwell among the Ephraimites.*

**1**  And the lot of the children of [[#^note-1a|Joseph]] fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el, ^verse-1

**2**  And goeth out from [[#^note-2a|Beth-el]] to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth, ^verse-2

**3**  And goeth down westward to the [[#^note-3a|coast]] of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth-horon the [[#^note-3b|nether]], and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea. ^verse-3

**4**  So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their [[#^note-4a|inheritance]]. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper; ^verse-5

**6**  And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; ^verse-6

**7**  And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. ^verse-7

**8**  The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. ^verse-8

**9**  And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. ^verse-9

**10**  And they drave not out the [[#^note-10a|Canaanites]] that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve [[#^note-10b|under tribute]]. ^verse-10
