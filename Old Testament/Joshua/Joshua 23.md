*Joshua exhorts Israel to be courageous, keep the commandments, love the Lord, and neither marry among nor cleave unto the remnants of the Canaanites who remain in the landâ€”When the children of Israel serve other gods, they will be cursed and dispossessed.*

**1**  And it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given [[#^note-1a|rest]] unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that [[#^note-1b|Joshua]] waxed old and stricken in age. ^verse-1

**2**  And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age: ^verse-2

**3**  And ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the [[#^note-4a|great sea]] westward. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord your God, he shall [[#^note-5a|expel]] them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath promised unto you. ^verse-5

**6**  Be ye therefore very [[#^note-6a|courageous]] to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; ^verse-6

**7**  That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their [[#^note-7a|gods]], nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: ^verse-7

**8**  But [[#^note-8a|cleave]] unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day. ^verse-8

**9**  For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to [[#^note-9a|stand]] before you unto this day. ^verse-9

**10**  One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he it is that [[#^note-10a|fighteth]] for you, as he hath [[#^note-10b|promised]] you. ^verse-10

**11**  Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your God. ^verse-11

**12**  Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make [[#^note-12a|marriages]] with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: ^verse-12

**13**  Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and [[#^note-13a|scourges]] in your sides, and [[#^note-13b|thorns]] in your eyes, until ye [[#^note-13c|perish]] from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you. ^verse-13

**14**  And, behold, this day I am going the [[#^note-14a|way]] of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the [[#^note-14b|good]] things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God [[#^note-15a|promised]] you; so shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you. ^verse-15

**16**  When ye have [[#^note-16a|transgressed]] the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the [[#^note-16b|good]] land which he hath given unto you. ^verse-16
