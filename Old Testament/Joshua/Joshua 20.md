*Six cities of refuge are appointed for those guilty of manslaughter.*

**1**  The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of [[#^note-2a|refuge]], whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: ^verse-2

**3**  That the [[#^note-3a|slayer]] that killeth any person [[#^note-3b|unawares and unwittingly]] may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. ^verse-3

**4**  And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the [[#^note-4a|gate]] of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the [[#^note-4b|elders]] of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. ^verse-4

**5**  And if the [[#^note-5a|avenger]] of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime. ^verse-5

**6**  And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the [[#^note-6a|high priest]] that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled. ^verse-6

**7**  Â¶ And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah. ^verse-7

**8**  And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in [[#^note-8a|Gilead]] out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. ^verse-8

**9**  These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the [[#^note-9a|stranger]] that [[#^note-9b|sojourneth]] among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation. ^verse-9
