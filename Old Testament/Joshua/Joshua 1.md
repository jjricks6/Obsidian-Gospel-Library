[[Old Testament/Joshua|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Joshua/Joshua 2|Next Entry]]

*The Lord speaks to Joshua—He is commanded to be of good courage, to meditate upon the law, and to keep the commandments—He prepares Israel to enter Canaan.*

**1**  Now after the [[#^note-1a|death]] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the [[#^note-2a|land]] which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. ^verse-3

**4**  From the wilderness and this [[#^note-4a|Lebanon]] even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the [[#^note-4b|great sea]] toward the going down of the sun, shall be your [[#^note-4c|coast]]. ^verse-4

**5**  There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with [[#^note-5a|Moses]], so I will be [[#^note-5b|with thee]]: I will not fail thee, nor [[#^note-5c|forsake]] thee. ^verse-5

**6**  Be strong and of a good [[#^note-6a|courage]]: for unto this people shalt thou [[#^note-6b|divide]] for an [[#^note-6c|inheritance]] the [[#^note-6d|land]], which I sware unto their fathers to give them. ^verse-6

**7**  Only be thou strong and very [[#^note-7a|courageous]], that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: [[#^note-7b|turn]] not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest [[#^note-7c|prosper]] whithersoever thou goest. ^verse-7

**8**  This book of the [[#^note-8a|law]] shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt [[#^note-8b|meditate]] therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. ^verse-8

**9**  Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the [[#^note-9a|Lord]] thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ Then Joshua commanded [[#^note-10a|the]] officers of the people, saying, ^verse-10

**11**  Pass through [[#^note-11a|the host]], and command the people, saying, Prepare you [[#^note-11b|victuals]]; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to [[#^note-11c|possess]] the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, ^verse-12

**13**  Remember the [[#^note-13a|word]] which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath given you [[#^note-13b|rest]], and hath given you this land. ^verse-13

**14**  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; ^verse-14

**15**  Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. ^verse-16

**17**  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. ^verse-17

**18**  Whosoever he be that doth [[#^note-18a|rebel]] against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to [[#^note-18b|death]]: only be strong and of a good courage. ^verse-18
