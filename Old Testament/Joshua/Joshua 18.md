*The tabernacle of the congregation is set up at Shiloh—Benjamin receives an inheritance by lot.*

**1**  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at [[#^note-1a|Shiloh]], and set up the [[#^note-1b|tabernacle]] of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them. ^verse-1

**2**  And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. ^verse-2

**3**  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you? ^verse-3

**4**  Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me. ^verse-4

**5**  And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their [[#^note-5a|coast]] on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. ^verse-5

**6**  Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast [[#^note-6a|lots]] for you here before the Lord our God. ^verse-6

**7**  But the [[#^note-7a|Levites]] have no part among you; for the priesthood of the Lord is their [[#^note-7b|inheritance]]: and Gad, and [[#^note-7c|Reuben]], and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh. ^verse-8

**9**  And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of [[#^note-11a|Benjamin]] came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. ^verse-11

**12**  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of [[#^note-12a|Beth-aven]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And the border went over from thence toward [[#^note-13a|Luz]], to the side of Luz, which is Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the [[#^note-13b|nether]] Beth-horon. ^verse-13

**14**  And the border was drawn thence, and [[#^note-14a|compassed]] the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter. ^verse-14

**15**  And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: ^verse-15

**16**  And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of [[#^note-16a|Hinnom]], and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of [[#^note-16b|Hinnom]], to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel, ^verse-16

**17**  And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the [[#^note-17a|stone]] of Bohan the son of Reuben, ^verse-17

**18**  And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: ^verse-18

**19**  And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of [[#^note-19a|the salt sea]] at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast. ^verse-19

**20**  And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families. ^verse-20

**21**  Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, ^verse-21

**22**  And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el, ^verse-22

**23**  And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, ^verse-23

**24**  And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: ^verse-24

**25**  Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, ^verse-25

**26**  And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, ^verse-26

**27**  And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, ^verse-27

**28**  And Zelah, Eleph, and [[#^note-28a|Jebusi]], which is Jerusalem, [[#^note-28b|Gibeath]], and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the [[#^note-28c|inheritance]] of the children of Benjamin according to their families. ^verse-28
