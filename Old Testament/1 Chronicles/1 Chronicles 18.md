*David subdues all the adversaries of Israel and reigns in justice over the people.*

**1**  Now after this it came to pass, that David [[#^note-1a|smote]] the Philistines, and subdued them, and took [[#^note-1b|Gath]] and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. ^verse-1

**2**  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. ^verse-3

**4**  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. ^verse-4

**5**  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. ^verse-5

**6**  Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. ^verse-6

**7**  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. ^verse-7

**8**  Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith [[#^note-8a|Solomon]] made the brasen [[#^note-8b|sea]], and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; ^verse-9

**10**  He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Them also king David dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. ^verse-11

**12**  Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the [[#^note-13a|Edomites]] became David's servants. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. ^verse-14

**15**  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. ^verse-15

**16**  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; ^verse-16

**17**  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. ^verse-17
