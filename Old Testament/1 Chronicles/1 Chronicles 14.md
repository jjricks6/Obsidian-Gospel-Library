### Chapter 14

[[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 13|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 15|Next Entry]]

*David marries wives, begets children, and defeats the Philistines; his fame spreads to all nations.*

**1**  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. ^verse-1

**2**  And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And David took more [[#^note-3a|wives]] at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. ^verse-3

**4**  Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, ^verse-4

**5**  And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, ^verse-5

**6**  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, ^verse-6

**7**  And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And when the Philistines heard that David was [[#^note-8a|anointed]] king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them. ^verse-8

**9**  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. ^verse-9

**10**  And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. ^verse-10

**11**  So they came up to [[#^note-11a|Baal-perazim]]; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. ^verse-11

**12**  And when they had left their [[#^note-12a|gods]] there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. ^verse-12

**13**  And the [[#^note-13a|Philistines]] yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. ^verse-14

**15**  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. ^verse-15

**16**  David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. ^verse-16

**17**  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations. ^verse-17
