[[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 21|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/1 Chronicles/1 Chronicles 23|Next Entry]]

*David prepares gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, and cedar wood for the temple—He charges Solomon to do the work of building it.*

**1**  Then David said, This is the [[#^note-1a|house]] of the Lord God, and this is the [[#^note-1b|altar]] of the burnt offering for Israel. ^verse-1

**2**  And David commanded to gather together the [[#^note-2a|strangers]] that were in the [[#^note-2b|land of Israel]]; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. ^verse-2

**3**  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; ^verse-3

**4**  Also [[#^note-4a|cedar]] trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. ^verse-4

**5**  And David said, Solomon my son is [[#^note-5a|young]] and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an [[#^note-6a|house]] for the Lord God of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my [[#^note-7a|mind]] to build an [[#^note-7b|house]] unto the name of the Lord my God: ^verse-7

**8**  But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of [[#^note-9a|rest]]; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be [[#^note-9b|Solomon]], and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. ^verse-9

**10**  He shall [[#^note-10a|build]] an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his [[#^note-10b|kingdom]] over Israel for ever. ^verse-10

**11**  Now, my son, the Lord be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee. ^verse-11

**12**  Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God. ^verse-12

**13**  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good [[#^note-13a|courage]]; dread not, nor be dismayed. ^verse-13

**14**  Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand [[#^note-14a|talents]] of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. ^verse-14

**15**  Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work. ^verse-15

**16**  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, ^verse-17

**18**  Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. ^verse-18

**19**  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the [[#^note-19a|ark]] of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. ^verse-19
