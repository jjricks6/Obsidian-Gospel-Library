[[Old Testament/Ruth|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Old Testament/Ruth/Ruth 2|Next Entry]]

*Elimelech and his family go to Moab because of famine—His sons marry—The father and sons die—Ruth, the Moabitess, her husband having died, remains constant to Naomi—They come to Bethlehem.*

**1**  Now it came to pass in the days when the [[#^note-1a|judges]] ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. ^verse-1

**2**  And the name of the man was [[#^note-2a|Elimelech]], and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, [[#^note-2b|Ephrathites]] of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. ^verse-2

**3**  And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. ^verse-3

**4**  And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years. ^verse-4

**5**  And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. ^verse-7

**8**  And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. ^verse-9

**10**  And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. ^verse-10

**11**  And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more [[#^note-11a|sons]] in my womb, that they may be your husbands? ^verse-11

**12**  Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; ^verse-12

**13**  Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me. ^verse-13

**14**  And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth [[#^note-14a|clave unto]] her. ^verse-14

**15**  And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. ^verse-15

**16**  And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from [[#^note-16a|following]] after thee: for whither thou [[#^note-16b|go]]est, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy [[#^note-16c|people]] shall be my people, and thy [[#^note-16d|God]] my God: ^verse-16

**17**  Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me. ^verse-17

**18**  When she saw that she was [[#^note-18a|steadfastly]] minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? ^verse-19

**20**  And she said unto them, Call me not [[#^note-20a|Naomi]], call me [[#^note-20b|Mara]]: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. ^verse-20

**21**  I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath [[#^note-21a|testified against me]], and the Almighty hath afflicted me? ^verse-21

**22**  So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest. ^verse-22
