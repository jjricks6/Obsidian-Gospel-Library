*Ruth gleans in the fields of Boaz, a near relative of Naomi—He treats Ruth kindly.*

**1**  And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was [[#^note-1a|Boaz]]. ^verse-1

**2**    And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and [[#^note-2a|glean]] ears of [[#^note-2b|corn]] after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. ^verse-2

**3**  And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her [[#^note-3a|hap]] was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. ^verse-3

**4**  ¶ And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee. ^verse-4

**5**  Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? ^verse-5

**6**  And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: ^verse-6

**7**  And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. ^verse-7

**8**  Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to [[#^note-8a|glean]] in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here [[#^note-8b|fast]] by my maidens: ^verse-8

**9**  Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. ^verse-9

**10**  Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take [[#^note-10a|knowledge]] of me, seeing I am a stranger? ^verse-10

**11**  And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. ^verse-11

**12**  The Lord recompense thy work, and a full [[#^note-12a|reward]] be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose [[#^note-12b|wings]] thou art come to trust. ^verse-12

**13**  Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken [[#^note-13a|friendly]] unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. ^verse-13

**14**  And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [[#^note-14a|corn]], and she did eat, and was sufficed, and [[#^note-14b|left]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: ^verse-15

**16**  And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. ^verse-16

**17**  So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. ^verse-18

**19**  And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she [[#^note-19a|shewed]] her mother in law with whom she had [[#^note-19b|wrought]], and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. ^verse-19

**20**  And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord, who hath not [[#^note-20a|left off]] his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our [[#^note-20b|next]] [[#^note-20c|kinsmen]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep [[#^note-21a|fast]] by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. ^verse-21

**22**  And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they [[#^note-22a|meet]] thee not in any other field. ^verse-22

**23**  So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. ^verse-23
