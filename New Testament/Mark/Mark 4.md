*Jesus gives the parables of the sower, the candle under a bushel, the seed growing secretly, and the mustard seed—He stills the tempest.*

**1**  And he began again to teach by the [[#^note-1a|sea]] side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. ^verse-1

**2**  And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his [[#^note-2a|doctrine]], ^verse-2

**3**  Hearken; Behold, there went out a [[#^note-3a|sower]] to sow: ^verse-3

**4**  And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. ^verse-4

**5**  And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: ^verse-5

**6**  But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. ^verse-6

**7**  And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. ^verse-7

**8**  And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. ^verse-8

**9**  And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. ^verse-9

**10**  And when he was [[#^note-10a|alone, they that were]] about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. ^verse-10

**11**  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the [[#^note-11a|mystery]] of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in [[#^note-11b|parables]]: ^verse-11

**12**  That seeing they may see, and not [[#^note-12a|perceive]]; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be [[#^note-12b|forgiven]] them. ^verse-12

**13**  And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ The sower soweth the word. ^verse-14

**15**  And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, [[#^note-15a|Satan]] cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. ^verse-15

**16**  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately [[#^note-16a|receive]] it with gladness; ^verse-16

**17**  And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when [[#^note-17a|affliction]] or [[#^note-17b|persecution]] ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. ^verse-17

**18**  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, ^verse-18

**19**  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of [[#^note-19a|riches]], and the [[#^note-19b|lusts]] of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. ^verse-19

**20**  And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ And he said unto them, Is a [[#^note-21a|candle]] brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? ^verse-21

**22**  For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|If]] any man have ears to hear, let him hear. ^verse-23

**24**  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: [[#^note-24a|and]] unto you that hear shall more be [[#^note-24b|given]]. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|For]] he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be [[#^note-25b|taken]] even that which he hath. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; ^verse-26

**27**  And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and [[#^note-27a|grow up]], he knoweth not how. ^verse-27

**28**  For the earth bringeth forth [[#^note-28a|fruit]] of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. ^verse-28

**29**  But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the [[#^note-29a|harvest]] is come. ^verse-29

**30**  ¶ And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? ^verse-30

**31**  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: ^verse-31

**32**  But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. ^verse-32

**33**  And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were [[#^note-33a|able to hear it]]. ^verse-33

**34**  But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. ^verse-34

**35**  And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. ^verse-35

**36**    And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. ^verse-36

**37**    And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. ^verse-37

**38**  And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? ^verse-38

**39**  And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, [[#^note-39a|Peace]], be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great [[#^note-39b|calm]]. ^verse-39

**40**  And he said unto them, Why are ye so [[#^note-40a|fearful]]? how is it that ye have no [[#^note-40b|faith]]? ^verse-40

**41**  And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? ^verse-41
