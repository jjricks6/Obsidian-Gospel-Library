*Pilate decrees the death of Jesus—Jesus is mocked and crucified between two thieves—He dies and is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.*

**1**  And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. ^verse-1

**2**  And [[#^note-2a|Pilate]] asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, [[#^note-2b|Thou sayest it]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he [[#^note-3a|answered]] nothing. ^verse-3

**4**  And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. ^verse-4

**5**  But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. ^verse-5

**6**  Now at that feast he [[#^note-6a|released]] unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. ^verse-6

**7**  And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. ^verse-7

**8**  And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. ^verse-8

**9**  But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the [[#^note-9a|King of the Jews]]? ^verse-9

**10**  For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for [[#^note-10a|envy]]. ^verse-10

**11**  But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. ^verse-11

**12**  And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? ^verse-12

**13**  And they cried out again, Crucify him. ^verse-13

**14**  Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. ^verse-15

**16**  And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band. ^verse-16

**17**  And they clothed him with purple, and plaited a crown of [[#^note-17a|thorns]], and put it about his head, ^verse-17

**18**  And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! ^verse-18

**19**  And they [[#^note-19a|smote]] him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. ^verse-19

**20**    And when they had [[#^note-20a|mocked]] him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. ^verse-20

**21**  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. ^verse-21

**22**  And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. ^verse-22

**23**  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. ^verse-23

**24**  And when they had crucified him, they parted his [[#^note-24a|garments]], casting lots upon them, what every man should take. ^verse-24

**25**  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. ^verse-25

**26**  And the superscription of his accusation was written over, The King of the Jews. ^verse-26

**27**  And with him they crucify two [[#^note-27a|thieves]]; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. ^verse-27

**28**  And the scripture was [[#^note-28a|fulfilled]], which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. ^verse-28

**29**  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, ^verse-29

**30**  Save thyself, and come down from the cross. ^verse-30

**31**  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. ^verse-31

**32**  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him [[#^note-32a|reviled]] him. ^verse-32

**33**  And when the sixth hour was come, there was [[#^note-33a|darkness]] over the whole land until the ninth hour. ^verse-33

**34**  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, [[#^note-34a|Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani]]? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou [[#^note-34b|forsaken]] me? ^verse-34

**35**  And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. ^verse-35

**36**  And one ran and filled a sponge full of [[#^note-36a|vinegar]], and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. ^verse-36

**37**  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the [[#^note-37a|ghost]]. ^verse-37

**38**  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. ^verse-39

**40**  There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; ^verse-40

**41**  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. ^verse-41

**42**  ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the [[#^note-42a|preparation]], that is, the day before the sabbath, ^verse-42

**43**  Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable [[#^note-43a|counsellor]], which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and [[#^note-43b|craved]] the body of Jesus. ^verse-43

**44**  And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. ^verse-44

**45**  And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. ^verse-45

**46**  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a [[#^note-46a|sepulchre]] which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. ^verse-46

**47**  And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. ^verse-47
