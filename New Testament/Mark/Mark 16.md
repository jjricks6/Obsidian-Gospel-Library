[[New Testament/Mark/Mark 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke|Next Entry]]

*Christ is risen—He appears to Mary Magdalene, then to others—He sends the Apostles to preach and promises that signs will follow faith—He ascends into heaven.*

**1**  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. ^verse-1

**2**  And very early in the morning the [[#^note-2a|first]] day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the [[#^note-2b|rising]] of the sun. ^verse-2

**3**  And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|And]] when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. ^verse-4

**5**  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, [[#^note-5a|clothed]] in a long white garment; and they were [[#^note-5b|affrighted]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is [[#^note-6a|risen]]; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. ^verse-6

**7**  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. ^verse-7

**8**  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Now when Jesus was [[#^note-9a|risen]] early the first day of the week, he [[#^note-9b|appeared]] first to [[#^note-9c|Mary Magdalene]], out of whom he had cast seven devils. ^verse-9

**10**  And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. ^verse-10

**11**  And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. ^verse-12

**13**  And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. ^verse-13

**14**    ¶ Afterward he appeared unto the [[#^note-14a|eleven]] as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their [[#^note-14b|unbelief]] and [[#^note-14c|hardness]] of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. ^verse-14

**15**  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and [[#^note-15a|preach]] the [[#^note-15b|gospel]] to every [[#^note-15c|creature]]. ^verse-15

**16**  He that [[#^note-16a|believeth]] and is [[#^note-16b|baptized]] shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be [[#^note-16c|damned]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And these [[#^note-17a|signs]] shall [[#^note-17b|follow]] them that believe; In my [[#^note-17c|name]] shall they [[#^note-17d|cast out]] [[#^note-17e|devils]]; they shall speak with new [[#^note-17f|tongues]]; ^verse-17

**18**  They shall take up [[#^note-18a|serpents]]; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not [[#^note-18b|hurt]] them; they shall lay [[#^note-18c|hands]] on the [[#^note-18d|sick]], and they shall recover. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ So then after the [[#^note-19a|Lord]] had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. ^verse-19

**20**  And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen. ^verse-20
