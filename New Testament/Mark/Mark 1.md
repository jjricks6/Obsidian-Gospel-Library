### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Mark|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Mark/Mark 2|Next Entry]]

*Jesus is baptized by John—He preaches the gospel, calls disciples, casts out devils, heals the sick, and cleanses a leper.*

**1**    The beginning of the [[#^note-1a|gospel]] of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; ^verse-1

**2**  As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my [[#^note-2a|messenger]] before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. ^verse-2

**3**  The [[#^note-3a|voice]] of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. ^verse-3

**4**  John did baptize in the wilderness, and [[#^note-4a|preach]] the [[#^note-4b|baptism]] of [[#^note-4c|repentance]] for the [[#^note-4d|remission]] of sins. ^verse-4

**5**  And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all [[#^note-5a|baptized]] of him in the river of Jordan, [[#^note-5b|confessing]] their sins. ^verse-5

**6**  And John was [[#^note-6a|clothed]] with [[#^note-6b|camel's]] hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat [[#^note-6c|locusts]] and wild honey; ^verse-6

**7**  And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. ^verse-7

**8**  I indeed have baptized you with water: [[#^note-8a|but]] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. ^verse-8

**9**    And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was [[#^note-9a|baptized]] of John in Jordan. ^verse-9

**10**  And straightway coming [[#^note-10a|up]] out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a [[#^note-10b|dove]] descending upon him: ^verse-10

**11**  And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|And]] immediately the Spirit driveth him into the [[#^note-12b|wilderness]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. ^verse-13

**14**  Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, [[#^note-14a|preaching]] the gospel of the kingdom of God, ^verse-14

**15**  And saying, The [[#^note-15a|time]] is fulfilled, and the [[#^note-15b|kingdom]] of God [[#^note-15c|is at hand]]: [[#^note-15d|repent]] ye, and [[#^note-15e|believe]] the gospel. ^verse-15

**16**    Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. ^verse-16

**17**  And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become [[#^note-17a|fishers of men]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. ^verse-18

**19**  And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. ^verse-19

**20**  And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. ^verse-20

**21**  And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and [[#^note-21a|taught]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had [[#^note-22a|authority]], and not as the [[#^note-22b|scribes]]. ^verse-22

**23**  And there was in their synagogue a man with an [[#^note-23a|unclean spirit]]; and he cried out, ^verse-23

**24**  Saying, Let us alone; [[#^note-24a|what]] have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the [[#^note-24b|Holy One]] of God. ^verse-24

**25**  And Jesus [[#^note-25a|rebuked]] him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. ^verse-25

**26**  And when the unclean spirit had [[#^note-26a|torn]] him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. ^verse-26

**27**  And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with [[#^note-27a|authority]] commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. ^verse-27

**28**  And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. ^verse-28

**29**  And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. ^verse-29

**30**  But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and [[#^note-30a|anon]] they tell him of her. ^verse-30

**31**  And he came and took her by the hand, and [[#^note-31a|lifted]] her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. ^verse-31

**32**  And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. ^verse-32

**33**  And all the city was gathered together at the door. ^verse-33

**34**  And he [[#^note-34a|healed]] many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many [[#^note-34b|devils]]; and [[#^note-34c|suffered not]] the devils to speak, because they knew him. ^verse-34

**35**  And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. ^verse-35

**36**  And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. ^verse-36

**37**  And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee. ^verse-37

**38**  And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may [[#^note-38a|preach]] there also: for therefore came I forth. ^verse-38

**39**  And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out [[#^note-39a|devils]]. ^verse-39

**40**  And there came a [[#^note-40a|leper]] to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me [[#^note-40b|clean]]. ^verse-40

**41**  And Jesus, moved with [[#^note-41a|compassion]], put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. ^verse-41

**42**  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. ^verse-42

**43**  And he [[#^note-43a|straitly charged him]], and forthwith sent him away; ^verse-43

**44**  And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. ^verse-44

**45**  But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to [[#^note-45a|blaze abroad]] the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. ^verse-45
