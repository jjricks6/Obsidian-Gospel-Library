### Chapter 18

*Jesus gives the parables of the unjust judge and the Pharisee and publican—He invites little children to come unto Him and teaches how to gain eternal life—He tells of His coming death and resurrection and gives sight to a blind man.*

**1**  And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought [[#^note-1a|always]] to [[#^note-1b|pray]], and not to [[#^note-1c|faint]]; ^verse-1

**2**  Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: ^verse-2

**3**  And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. ^verse-3

**4**  And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; ^verse-4

**5**  Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord said, Hear what the [[#^note-6a|unjust]] judge saith. ^verse-6

**7**  And shall not God [[#^note-7a|avenge]] his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with [[#^note-7b|them]]? ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|I]] tell you that he will [[#^note-8b|avenge]] them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? ^verse-8

**9**  And he spake this parable unto certain which [[#^note-9a|trusted]] in themselves that they were righteous, and [[#^note-9b|despised]] others: ^verse-9

**10**  Two men went up into the temple to [[#^note-10a|pray]]; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. ^verse-10

**11**  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am [[#^note-11a|not]] as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. ^verse-11

**12**  I [[#^note-12a|fast]] twice in the week, I give [[#^note-12b|tithes]] of all that I [[#^note-12c|possess]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a [[#^note-13a|sinner]]. ^verse-13

**14**  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that [[#^note-14a|exalteth]] himself shall be abased; and he that [[#^note-14b|humbleth]] himself shall be exalted. ^verse-14

**15**    And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. ^verse-15

**16**  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little [[#^note-16a|children]] to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. ^verse-16

**17**  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. ^verse-17

**18**    And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit [[#^note-18a|eternal life]]? ^verse-18

**19**  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me [[#^note-19a|good]]? none is good, save one, that is, God. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit [[#^note-20a|adultery]], Do not [[#^note-20b|kill]], Do not steal, Do not bear [[#^note-20c|false witness]], [[#^note-20d|Honour]] thy father and thy mother. ^verse-20

**21**  And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. ^verse-21

**22**  Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the [[#^note-22a|poor]], and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. ^verse-22

**23**  And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. ^verse-23

**24**  And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ^verse-24

**25**  For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ^verse-25

**26**  And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|And]] he said, The things which are im[[#^note-27b|possible]] with men are possible with God. ^verse-27

**28**  Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. ^verse-28

**29**  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, ^verse-29

**30**  Who shall not [[#^note-30a|receive]] [[#^note-30b|manifold]] more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are [[#^note-31a|written]] by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. ^verse-31

**32**  For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be [[#^note-32a|mocked]], and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: ^verse-32

**33**  And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall [[#^note-33a|rise]] again. ^verse-33

**34**  And they [[#^note-34a|understood]] none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. ^verse-34

**35**  ¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: ^verse-35

**36**  And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. ^verse-36

**37**  And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. ^verse-37

**38**  And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. ^verse-38

**39**  And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. ^verse-39

**40**  And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, ^verse-40

**41**  Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. ^verse-41

**42**  And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy [[#^note-42a|sight]]: thy [[#^note-42b|faith]] hath saved thee. ^verse-42

**43**  And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, [[#^note-43a|glorifying]] God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. ^verse-43
