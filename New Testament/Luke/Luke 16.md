### Chapter 16

[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 17|Next Entry]]

*Jesus gives the parable of the unjust steward—He teaches of service and condemns divorce—He gives the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.*

**1**  And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had [[#^note-1a|wasted]] his goods. ^verse-1

**2**  And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an [[#^note-2a|account]] of thy [[#^note-2b|stewardship]]; for thou mayest be no longer steward. ^verse-2

**3**  Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. ^verse-3

**4**  I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. ^verse-4

**5**  So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? ^verse-5

**6**  And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. ^verse-7

**8**  And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the [[#^note-8a|children]] of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of [[#^note-8b|light]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the [[#^note-9a|mammon]] of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. ^verse-9

**10**  He that is [[#^note-10a|faithful]] in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. ^verse-10

**11**  If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your [[#^note-11a|trust]] the true [[#^note-11b|riches]]? ^verse-11

**12**  And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ No servant can serve two [[#^note-13a|masters]]: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Pharisees also, who were [[#^note-14a|covetous]], heard all these things: and they derided him. ^verse-14

**15**  And he said unto them, Ye are they which [[#^note-15a|justify]] yourselves before men; but God [[#^note-15b|knoweth]] your [[#^note-15c|hearts]]: for that which is highly esteemed among [[#^note-15d|men]] is [[#^note-15e|abomination]] in the sight of God. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|The]] law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. ^verse-16

**17**  And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the [[#^note-17a|law]] to fail. ^verse-17

**18**  Whosoever [[#^note-18a|putteth]] away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: ^verse-19

**20**  And there was a certain [[#^note-20a|beggar]] named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, ^verse-20

**21**  And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. ^verse-21

**22**  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the [[#^note-22a|angels]] into [[#^note-22b|Abraham's bosom]]: the rich man also died, and was buried; ^verse-22

**23**  And in [[#^note-23a|hell]] he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. ^verse-23

**24**  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. ^verse-24

**25**  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime [[#^note-25a|receivedst]] thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. ^verse-25

**26**  And beside all this, between us and you there is a great [[#^note-26a|gulf]] fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. ^verse-26

**27**  Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: ^verse-27

**28**  For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. ^verse-28

**29**  Abraham saith unto him, They have [[#^note-29a|Moses]] and the prophets; let them hear them. ^verse-29

**30**  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the [[#^note-30a|dead]], they will repent. ^verse-30

**31**  And he said unto him, If they [[#^note-31a|hear]] not Moses and the [[#^note-31b|prophets]], neither will they be [[#^note-31c|persuaded]], though one rose from the dead. ^verse-31
