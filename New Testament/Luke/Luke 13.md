### Chapter 13

[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 14|Next Entry]]

*Jesus teaches, Repent or perish—He gives the parable of the barren fig tree, heals a woman on the Sabbath, and likens the kingdom of God to a mustard seed—He discusses whether few or many are saved and laments over Jerusalem.*

**1**  There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilæans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. ^verse-1

**2**  And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilæans were [[#^note-2a|sinners]] above all the Galilæans, because they suffered such things? ^verse-2

**3**  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye [[#^note-3a|repent]], ye shall all likewise [[#^note-3b|perish]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? ^verse-4

**5**  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his [[#^note-6a|vineyard]]; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: [[#^note-7a|cut]] it down; why cumbereth it the ground? ^verse-7

**8**  And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: ^verse-8

**9**  And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. ^verse-9

**10**  And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. ^verse-11

**12**  And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. ^verse-12

**13**  And he [[#^note-13a|laid]] his [[#^note-13b|hands]] on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. ^verse-13

**14**  And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to [[#^note-14a|work]]: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. ^verse-14

**15**  The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? ^verse-15

**16**  And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the [[#^note-16a|sabbath]] day? ^verse-16

**17**  And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I [[#^note-18a|resemble]] it? ^verse-18

**19**  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and [[#^note-19a|waxed]] a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. ^verse-19

**20**  And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? ^verse-20

**21**  It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. ^verse-21

**22**  And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. ^verse-22

**23**  Then said one unto him, Lord, are there [[#^note-23a|few]] that be saved? And he said unto them, ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Strive to enter in at the [[#^note-24a|strait]] [[#^note-24b|gate]]: for many, I say unto you, will [[#^note-24c|seek]] to enter in, and shall not be able. ^verse-24

**25**  When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, [[#^note-25a|Lord]], Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: ^verse-25

**26**  Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. ^verse-26

**27**  But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; [[#^note-27a|depart]] from me, all ye workers of iniquity. ^verse-27

**28**  There shall be [[#^note-28a|weeping]] and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the [[#^note-28b|kingdom]] of God, and you yourselves thrust out. ^verse-28

**29**  And [[#^note-29a|they]] shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. ^verse-29

**30**  And, behold, there are last which shall be [[#^note-30a|first]], and there are first which shall be last. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for [[#^note-31a|Herod]] will kill thee. ^verse-31

**32**  And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be [[#^note-32a|perfected]]. ^verse-32

**33**  Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a [[#^note-33a|prophet]] perish out of [[#^note-33b|Jerusalem]]. ^verse-33

**34**  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which [[#^note-34a|killest]] the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a [[#^note-34b|hen]] doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! ^verse-34

**35**  Behold, your house is left unto you [[#^note-35a|desolate]]: and verily I say unto you, [[#^note-35b|Ye]] shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, [[#^note-35c|Blessed]] is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. ^verse-35
