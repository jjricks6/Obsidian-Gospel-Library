*Jesus came to save souls—He gives the parable of the pounds—He rides in triumph into Jerusalem, weeps over the city, and cleanses the temple again.*

**1**  And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, there was a man named Zacchæus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. ^verse-2

**3**  And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the [[#^note-3a|press]], because he was little of stature. ^verse-3

**4**  And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. ^verse-4

**5**  And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. ^verse-5

**6**  And he made haste, and came down, and [[#^note-6a|received]] him joyfully. ^verse-6

**7**  And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. ^verse-7

**8**  And Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him [[#^note-8a|fourfold]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. ^verse-9

**10**  For the Son of man is come to seek and to [[#^note-10a|save]] that which was [[#^note-10b|lost]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should [[#^note-11a|immediately]] appear. ^verse-11

**12**  He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. ^verse-12

**13**  And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten [[#^note-13a|pounds]], and said unto them, [[#^note-13b|Occupy]] till I come. ^verse-13

**14**  But his [[#^note-14a|citizens]] hated him, and sent a [[#^note-14b|message]] after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. ^verse-14

**15**  And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these [[#^note-15a|servants]] to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. ^verse-15

**16**  Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. ^verse-16

**17**  And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been [[#^note-17a|faithful]] in a very little, have thou [[#^note-17b|authority]] over ten cities. ^verse-17

**18**  And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. ^verse-18

**19**  And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. ^verse-19

**20**  And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: ^verse-20

**21**  For I [[#^note-21a|feared]] thee, because thou art an [[#^note-21b|austere]] man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. ^verse-21

**22**  And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: ^verse-22

**23**  Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have [[#^note-23a|required]] mine own with [[#^note-23b|usury]]? ^verse-23

**24**  And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. ^verse-24

**25**  (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) ^verse-25

**26**  For I say unto you, That unto every one [[#^note-26a|which]] hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. ^verse-26

**27**  But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. ^verse-28

**29**    And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, ^verse-29

**30**  Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. ^verse-30

**31**  And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. ^verse-31

**32**  And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. ^verse-32

**33**  And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? ^verse-33

**34**  And they said, The Lord hath need of him. ^verse-34

**35**  And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the [[#^note-35a|colt]], and they set Jesus thereon. ^verse-35

**36**  And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. ^verse-36

**37**  And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; ^verse-37

**38**  Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and [[#^note-38a|glory]] in the highest. ^verse-38

**39**  And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. ^verse-39

**40**  And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the [[#^note-40a|stones]] would immediately cry out. ^verse-40

**41**  ¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, ^verse-41

**42**  Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. ^verse-42

**43**  For the days shall come upon thee, that thine [[#^note-43a|enemies]] shall cast a [[#^note-43b|trench]] about thee, and [[#^note-43c|compass]] thee round, and keep thee in on every side, ^verse-43

**44**  And shall [[#^note-44a|lay]] thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one [[#^note-44b|stone]] upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy [[#^note-44c|visitation]]. ^verse-44

**45**    And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; ^verse-45

**46**  Saying unto them, It is written, My [[#^note-46a|house]] is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a [[#^note-46b|den]] of thieves. ^verse-46

**47**  And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, ^verse-47

**48**  And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. ^verse-48
