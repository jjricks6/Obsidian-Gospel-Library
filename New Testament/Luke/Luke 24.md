### Chapter 24

[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John|Next Entry]]

*Angels announce the resurrection of Christ—He walks on the Emmaus road—He appears with a body of flesh and bones, eats food, testifies of His divinity, and promises the Holy Ghost—He ascends into heaven.*

**1**  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the [[#^note-1a|sepulchre]], bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|And]] they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. ^verse-2

**3**  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-3

**4**  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: ^verse-4

**5**  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? ^verse-5

**6**  He is not here, but is [[#^note-6a|risen]]: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, ^verse-6

**7**  Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. ^verse-7

**8**  And they remembered his words, ^verse-8

**9**  And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. ^verse-9

**10**  It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. ^verse-10

**11**  And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. ^verse-11

**12**  Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [[#^note-13a|about threescore furlongs]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And they talked together of all these things which had happened. ^verse-14

**15**  And it came to pass, that, while they [[#^note-15a|communed]] together and reasoned, [[#^note-15b|Jesus]] himself drew near, and went with them. ^verse-15

**16**  But their eyes were [[#^note-16a|holden]] that they should not know him. ^verse-16

**17**  And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? ^verse-17

**18**  And the one of them, whose name was [[#^note-18a|Cleopas]], answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? ^verse-18

**19**  And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: ^verse-19

**20**  And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. ^verse-20

**21**  But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. ^verse-21

**22**  Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; ^verse-22

**23**  And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. ^verse-23

**24**  And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. ^verse-24

**25**  Then he said unto them, O [[#^note-25a|fools]], and slow of [[#^note-25b|heart]] to [[#^note-25c|believe]] all that the prophets have spoken: ^verse-25

**26**  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? ^verse-26

**27**  And beginning at [[#^note-27a|Moses]] and all the [[#^note-27b|prophets]], he [[#^note-27c|expounded]] unto them in all the [[#^note-27d|scriptures]] the things concerning himself. ^verse-27

**28**  And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. ^verse-28

**29**  But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. ^verse-29

**30**  And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. ^verse-30

**31**  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. ^verse-31

**32**  And they said one to another, Did not our [[#^note-32a|heart]] [[#^note-32b|burn]] within us, while he [[#^note-32c|talked]] with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? ^verse-32

**33**  And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, ^verse-33

**34**  Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath [[#^note-34a|appeared]] to [[#^note-34b|Simon]]. ^verse-34

**35**  And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. ^verse-35

**36**    ¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself [[#^note-36a|stood]] in the midst of them, and saith unto them, [[#^note-36b|Peace]] be unto you. ^verse-36

**37**  But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. ^verse-37

**38**  And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do [[#^note-38a|thoughts]] arise in your hearts? ^verse-38

**39**  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: [[#^note-39a|handle]] me, and see; for a [[#^note-39b|spirit]] hath not [[#^note-39c|flesh]] and bones, as ye [[#^note-39d|see]] me have. ^verse-39

**40**  And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. ^verse-40

**41**  And while they yet believed not for joy, and [[#^note-41a|wondered]], he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? ^verse-41

**42**  And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. ^verse-42

**43**  And he took it, and did eat before them. ^verse-43

**44**  And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be [[#^note-44a|fulfilled]], which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. ^verse-44

**45**  Then opened he their [[#^note-45a|understanding]], that they might understand the scriptures, ^verse-45

**46**  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it [[#^note-46a|behoved]] Christ to suffer, and to [[#^note-46b|rise]] from the dead the third day: ^verse-46

**47**  And that [[#^note-47a|repentance]] and [[#^note-47b|remission]] of sins should be [[#^note-47c|preached]] in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. ^verse-47

**48**  And ye are [[#^note-48a|witnesses]] of these things. ^verse-48

**49**  ¶ And, behold, I send the [[#^note-49a|promise]] of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be [[#^note-49b|endued]] with power from on high. ^verse-49

**50**  ¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. ^verse-50

**51**  And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and [[#^note-51a|carried]] up into heaven. ^verse-51

**52**  And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: ^verse-52

**53**  And were continually in the [[#^note-53a|temple]], praising and blessing God. Amen. ^verse-53
