*Jesus is taken before Pilate, then to Herod, and then to Pilate again—Barabbas is released—Jesus is crucified between two thieves—He is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.*

**1**  And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. ^verse-1

**2**  And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to [[#^note-2a|Cæsar]], saying that he himself is Christ a [[#^note-2b|King]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. ^verse-3

**4**  Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no [[#^note-4a|fault]] in this man. ^verse-4

**5**  And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. ^verse-5

**6**  When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan. ^verse-6

**7**  And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some [[#^note-8a|miracle]] done by him. ^verse-8

**9**  Then he questioned with him in many words; but he [[#^note-9a|answered]] him nothing. ^verse-9

**10**  And the chief priests and [[#^note-10a|scribes]] stood and vehemently accused him. ^verse-10

**11**  And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and [[#^note-11a|mocked]] him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, ^verse-13

**14**  Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: ^verse-14

**15**  No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done [[#^note-15a|unto]] him. ^verse-15

**16**  I will therefore chastise him, and release him. ^verse-16

**17**  (For of necessity he must [[#^note-17a|release]] one unto them at the feast.) ^verse-17

**18**  And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: ^verse-18

**19**  (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for [[#^note-19a|murder]], was cast into prison.) ^verse-19

**20**  Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. ^verse-20

**21**  But they cried, saying, [[#^note-21a|Crucify]] him, crucify him. ^verse-21

**22**  And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found [[#^note-22a|no]] cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. ^verse-22

**23**  And they were [[#^note-23a|instant]] with loud voices, [[#^note-23b|requiring]] that he might be [[#^note-23c|crucified]]. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. ^verse-23

**24**  And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they [[#^note-24a|required]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And he released unto them him that for sedition and [[#^note-25a|murder]] was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. ^verse-25

**26**  And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. ^verse-27

**28**  But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of [[#^note-28a|Jerusalem]], weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. ^verse-28

**29**  For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the [[#^note-29a|barren]], and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. ^verse-29

**30**  Then shall they begin to say to the [[#^note-30a|mountains]], Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. ^verse-30

**31**  For if they do these things in a [[#^note-31a|green tree]], what shall be done in the [[#^note-31b|dry]]? ^verse-31

**32**  And there were also two other, [[#^note-32a|malefactors]], led with him to be put to death. ^verse-32

**33**    And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. ^verse-33

**34**  ¶ Then [[#^note-34a|said]] Jesus, Father, [[#^note-34b|forgive]] them; for they know not what [[#^note-34c|they do]]. And they parted his [[#^note-34d|raiment]], and cast lots. ^verse-34

**35**  And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them [[#^note-35a|derided]] him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the [[#^note-35b|chosen]] of God. ^verse-35

**36**  And the soldiers also [[#^note-36a|mocked]] him, coming to him, and offering him [[#^note-36b|vinegar]], ^verse-36

**37**  And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. ^verse-37

**38**  And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, This Is the [[#^note-38a|King]] of the [[#^note-38b|Jews]]. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged [[#^note-39a|railed on]] him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. ^verse-39

**40**  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? ^verse-40

**41**  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due [[#^note-41a|reward]] of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. ^verse-41

**42**  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. ^verse-42

**43**  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in [[#^note-43a|paradise]]. ^verse-43

**44**  And it was about the [[#^note-44a|sixth]] hour, and there was a [[#^note-44b|darkness]] over all the [[#^note-44c|earth]] until the ninth hour. ^verse-44

**45**  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the [[#^note-45a|midst]]. ^verse-45

**46**  ¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I [[#^note-46a|commend]] my [[#^note-46b|spirit]]: and having said thus, he [[#^note-46c|gave]] up the [[#^note-46d|ghost]]. ^verse-46

**47**  Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a [[#^note-47a|righteous]] man. ^verse-47

**48**  And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. ^verse-48

**49**  And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. ^verse-49

**50**  ¶ And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a [[#^note-50a|counsellor]]; and he was a good man, and a just: ^verse-50

**51**  (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. ^verse-51

**52**  This man went unto Pilate, and [[#^note-52a|begged]] the body of Jesus. ^verse-52

**53**  And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a [[#^note-53a|sepulchre]] that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. ^verse-53

**54**  And that day was the [[#^note-54a|preparation]], and the sabbath drew on. ^verse-54

**55**  And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the [[#^note-55a|sepulchre]], and how his body was laid. ^verse-55

**56**  And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and [[#^note-56a|rested]] the sabbath day according to the commandment. ^verse-56
