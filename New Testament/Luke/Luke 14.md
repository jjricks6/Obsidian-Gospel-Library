[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 13|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 15|Next Entry]]

*Jesus again heals on the Sabbath—He teaches humility and gives the parable of the great supper—Those who follow Him must forsake all else.*

**1**  And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. ^verse-2

**3**  And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? ^verse-3

**4**  And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; ^verse-4

**5**  And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the [[#^note-5a|sabbath]] day? ^verse-5

**6**  And they could not answer him again to these things. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the [[#^note-7a|chief rooms]]; saying unto them, ^verse-7

**8**  When thou art [[#^note-8a|bidden]] of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; ^verse-8

**9**  And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. ^verse-9

**10**  But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the [[#^note-10a|lowest]] room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up [[#^note-10b|higher]]: then shalt thou have [[#^note-10c|worship]] in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. ^verse-10

**11**  For whosoever [[#^note-11a|exalteth]] himself shall be [[#^note-11b|abased]]; and he that [[#^note-11c|humbleth]] himself shall be exalted. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. ^verse-12

**13**  But when thou makest a feast, call the [[#^note-13a|poor]], the maimed, the lame, the blind: ^verse-13

**14**  And thou shalt be [[#^note-14a|blessed]]; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be [[#^note-14b|recompensed]] at the [[#^note-14c|resurrection]] of the just. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And when one of them that sat at m[[#^note-15a|eat]] with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat [[#^note-15b|bread]] in the kingdom of God. ^verse-15

**16**  Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: ^verse-16

**17**  And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. ^verse-17

**18**  And they all with one consent began to make [[#^note-18a|excuse]]. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. ^verse-18

**19**  And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. ^verse-19

**20**  And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. ^verse-20

**21**  So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the [[#^note-21a|halt]], and the blind. ^verse-21

**22**  And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. ^verse-22

**23**  And the [[#^note-23a|lord]] said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and [[#^note-23b|hedges]], and [[#^note-23c|compel]] them to come in, that my house may be filled. ^verse-23

**24**  For I say unto you, That [[#^note-24a|none]] of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, ^verse-25

**26**  If any man come to me, and [[#^note-26a|hate]] not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, [[#^note-26b|yea]], and his own [[#^note-26c|life]] also, he cannot be my [[#^note-26d|disciple]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And whosoever doth not bear his [[#^note-27a|cross]], and come after me, cannot be my [[#^note-27b|disciple]]. ^verse-27

**28**  For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and [[#^note-28a|counteth]] the [[#^note-28b|cost]], whether he have sufficient to [[#^note-28c|finish]] it? ^verse-28

**29**  Lest [[#^note-29a|haply]], after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, ^verse-29

**30**  Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to [[#^note-30a|finish]]. ^verse-30

**31**  Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and [[#^note-31a|consulteth]] whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? ^verse-31

**32**  Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an [[#^note-32a|ambassage]], and desireth conditions of peace. ^verse-32

**33**  So likewise, whosoever he be of you that [[#^note-33a|forsaketh]] not all that he hath, he cannot be my [[#^note-33b|disciple]]. ^verse-33

**34**  ¶ [[#^note-34a|Salt]] is good: but if the [[#^note-34b|salt]] have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? ^verse-34

**35**  It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. ^verse-35
