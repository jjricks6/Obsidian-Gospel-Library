[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 21|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 23|Next Entry]]

*Jesus institutes the sacrament—He suffers in Gethsemane and is betrayed and arrested—Peter denies knowing Him—Jesus is smitten and mocked.*

**1**  Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the [[#^note-1a|Passover]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And the chief [[#^note-2a|priests]] and [[#^note-2b|scribes]] sought how they might [[#^note-2c|kill]] him; for they feared the people. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. ^verse-3

**4**  And he went his way, and [[#^note-4a|communed]] with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  And they were glad, and covenanted to give him [[#^note-5a|money]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. ^verse-6

**7**    ¶ Then came the day of [[#^note-7a|unleavened]] bread, when the [[#^note-7b|passover]] must be killed. ^verse-7

**8**  And he sent [[#^note-8a|Peter]] and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. ^verse-8

**9**  And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? ^verse-9

**10**  And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. ^verse-10

**11**  And ye shall say unto the [[#^note-11a|goodman]] of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? ^verse-11

**12**  And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. ^verse-12

**13**  And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. ^verse-13

**14**  And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. ^verse-14

**15**  And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: ^verse-15

**16**  For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, [[#^note-16a|until]] it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ^verse-16

**17**  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: ^verse-17

**18**  For I say unto you, I will not [[#^note-18a|drink]] of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And he took [[#^note-19a|bread]], and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my [[#^note-19b|body]] which is [[#^note-19c|given]] for you: this do in [[#^note-19d|remembrance]] of me. ^verse-19

**20**  Likewise also the [[#^note-20a|cup]] after supper, saying, This cup is the new [[#^note-20b|testament]] in my blood, which is shed for you. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. ^verse-21

**22**  And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was [[#^note-22a|determined]]: but woe unto that man by whom he is [[#^note-22b|betrayed]]! ^verse-22

**23**  And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And there was also a [[#^note-24a|strife]] among them, which of them should be accounted the [[#^note-24b|greatest]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And he said unto them, The [[#^note-25a|kings]] of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. ^verse-25

**26**  But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth [[#^note-26a|serve]]. ^verse-26

**27**  For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that [[#^note-27a|serveth]]? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. ^verse-27

**28**  Ye are they which have [[#^note-28a|continued]] with me in my [[#^note-28b|temptations]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath [[#^note-29a|appointed]] unto me; ^verse-29

**30**  That ye may [[#^note-30a|eat]] and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones [[#^note-30b|judging]] the twelve tribes of Israel. ^verse-30

**31**    ¶ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, [[#^note-31a|Satan]] hath desired to [[#^note-31b|have]] you, that he may sift you as wheat: ^verse-31

**32**  But I have [[#^note-32a|prayed]] for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art [[#^note-32b|converted]], [[#^note-32c|strengthen]] thy brethren. ^verse-32

**33**  And he said unto him, Lord, I am [[#^note-33a|ready]] to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. ^verse-33

**34**  And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt [[#^note-34a|thrice]] deny that thou knowest me. ^verse-34

**35**  And he said unto them, When I sent you without [[#^note-35a|purse]], and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. ^verse-35

**36**  Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. ^verse-36

**37**  For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the [[#^note-37a|transgressors]]: for the things concerning me have an end. ^verse-37

**38**  And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. ^verse-38

**39**    ¶ And he came out, and went, as he was [[#^note-39a|wont]], to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. ^verse-39

**40**  And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into [[#^note-40a|temptation]]. ^verse-40

**41**  And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, ^verse-41

**42**  Saying, Father, if thou be willing, [[#^note-42a|remove]] this cup from me: nevertheless not my [[#^note-42b|will]], but thine, be done. ^verse-42

**43**  And there appeared an [[#^note-43a|angel]] unto him from heaven, strengthening him. ^verse-43

**44**  And being in an [[#^note-44a|agony]] he prayed more earnestly: [[#^note-44b|and]] his sweat was as it were great drops of [[#^note-44c|blood]] falling down to the ground. ^verse-44

**45**  And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, ^verse-45

**46**  And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. ^verse-46

**47**    ¶ And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. ^verse-47

**48**  But Jesus said unto him, [[#^note-48a|Judas]], [[#^note-48b|betrayest]] thou the Son of man with a [[#^note-48c|kiss]]? ^verse-48

**49**  When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? ^verse-49

**50**  ¶ And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. ^verse-50

**51**  And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and [[#^note-51a|healed]] him. ^verse-51

**52**  Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? ^verse-52

**53**  When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of [[#^note-53a|darkness]]. ^verse-53

**54**  ¶ Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. ^verse-54

**55**  And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the [[#^note-55a|hall]], and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. ^verse-55

**56**  But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. ^verse-56

**57**  And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. ^verse-57

**58**  And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. ^verse-58

**59**  And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilæan. ^verse-59

**60**  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. ^verse-60

**61**  And the [[#^note-61a|Lord]] turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. ^verse-61

**62**  And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. ^verse-62

**63**  ¶ And the men that held Jesus [[#^note-63a|mocked]] him, and smote him. ^verse-63

**64**  And when they had [[#^note-64a|blindfolded]] him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? ^verse-64

**65**  And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. ^verse-65

**66**  ¶ And as soon as it was day, [[#^note-66a|the]] elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, ^verse-66

**67**  Art thou the [[#^note-67a|Christ]]? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: ^verse-67

**68**  And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. ^verse-68

**69**  [[#^note-69a|Hereafter]] shall the [[#^note-69b|Son of man]] sit on the right hand of the power of God. ^verse-69

**70**  Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. ^verse-70

**71**  And they said, What need we any further [[#^note-71a|witness]]? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. ^verse-71
