### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Luke|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 2|Next Entry]]

*Gabriel promises Zacharias that Elisabeth will bear a son, whom they will name John—He also tells Mary that she will be the mother of the Son of God—Mary visits Elisabeth and utters a psalm of praise—John the Baptist is born—Zacharias prophesies of John's mission.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Forasmuch]] as [[#^note-1b|many]] have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things [[#^note-1c|which]] are most surely believed among us, ^verse-1

**2**  Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were [[#^note-2a|eyewitnesses]], and ministers of the word; ^verse-2

**3**  It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent [[#^note-3a|Theophilus]], ^verse-3

**4**  That thou mightest [[#^note-4a|know]] the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judæa, a certain priest named [[#^note-5a|Zacharias]], of the course of [[#^note-5b|Abia]]: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. ^verse-5

**6**  And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and [[#^note-6a|ordinances]] of the Lord blameless. ^verse-6

**7**  And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was [[#^note-7a|barren]], and they both were now well [[#^note-7b|stricken]] in years. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass, that while he executed the [[#^note-8a|priest's]] office before God in the order of his [[#^note-8b|course]], ^verse-8

**9**  According to the custom of the [[#^note-9a|priest's]] office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. ^verse-10

**11**  And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. ^verse-11

**12**  And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. ^verse-12

**13**  But the angel said unto him, [[#^note-13a|Fear not]], Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a [[#^note-13b|son]], and thou shalt call his name John. ^verse-13

**14**  And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. ^verse-14

**15**  For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither [[#^note-15a|wine]] nor strong drink; and he shall be [[#^note-15b|filled]] with the [[#^note-15c|Holy Ghost]], even from his mother's womb. ^verse-15

**16**  And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. ^verse-16

**17**  And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of [[#^note-17a|Elias]], to turn the hearts of the [[#^note-17b|fathers]] to the children, and the [[#^note-17c|disobedient]] to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people [[#^note-17d|prepared]] for the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I [[#^note-18a|know]] this? for I am an [[#^note-18b|old]] man, and my wife well [[#^note-18c|stricken]] in years. ^verse-18

**19**  And the [[#^note-19a|angel]] answering said unto him, I am [[#^note-19b|Gabriel]], that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. ^verse-19

**20**  And, behold, thou shalt be [[#^note-20a|dumb]], and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou [[#^note-20b|believest]] not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. ^verse-20

**21**  And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. ^verse-21

**22**  And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. ^verse-22

**23**  And it came to pass, that, as soon as the [[#^note-23a|days]] of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. ^verse-23

**24**  And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, ^verse-24

**25**  Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my [[#^note-25a|reproach]] among men. ^verse-25

**26**    And in the sixth month the [[#^note-26a|angel]] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, ^verse-26

**27**  To a [[#^note-27a|virgin]] espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. ^verse-27

**28**  And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among [[#^note-28a|women]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. ^verse-29

**30**  And the angel said unto her, [[#^note-30a|Fear not]], Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. ^verse-30

**31**  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name [[#^note-31a|Jesus]]. ^verse-31

**32**  He shall be great, and shall be called the [[#^note-32a|Son]] of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the [[#^note-32b|throne]] of his father [[#^note-32c|David]]: ^verse-32

**33**  And he shall [[#^note-33a|reign]] over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no [[#^note-33b|end]]. ^verse-33

**34**  Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I [[#^note-34a|know not]] a man? ^verse-34

**35**  And the angel answered and said unto her, The [[#^note-35a|Holy Ghost]] shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the [[#^note-35b|Son of God]]. ^verse-35

**36**  And, behold, thy [[#^note-36a|cousin]] Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her [[#^note-36b|old]] age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. ^verse-36

**37**  For with God nothing shall be [[#^note-37a|impossible]]. ^verse-37

**38**  And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. ^verse-38

**39**    And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; ^verse-39

**40**  And entered into the house of Zacharias, and [[#^note-40a|saluted]] Elisabeth. ^verse-40

**41**  And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was [[#^note-41a|filled]] with the Holy Ghost: ^verse-41

**42**  And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among [[#^note-42a|women]], and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. ^verse-42

**43**  And [[#^note-43a|whence]] is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? ^verse-43

**44**  For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. ^verse-44

**45**  And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. ^verse-45

**46**  And Mary [[#^note-46a|said]], My soul doth [[#^note-46b|magnify]] the Lord, ^verse-46

**47**  And my spirit hath [[#^note-47a|rejoiced]] in God my [[#^note-47b|Saviour]]. ^verse-47

**48**  For he hath regarded the low estate of his [[#^note-48a|handmaiden]]: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me [[#^note-48b|blessed]]. ^verse-48

**49**  For he that is mighty hath done to me great [[#^note-49a|things]]; and [[#^note-49b|holy]] is his name. ^verse-49

**50**  And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. ^verse-50

**51**  He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the [[#^note-51a|proud]] in the imagination of their hearts. ^verse-51

**52**  He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of [[#^note-52a|low]] degree. ^verse-52

**53**  He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. ^verse-53

**54**  He hath [[#^note-54a|holpen]] his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; ^verse-54

**55**  As he spake to our [[#^note-55a|fathers]], to Abraham, and to his [[#^note-55b|seed]] for ever. ^verse-55

**56**  And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. ^verse-56

**57**    Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. ^verse-57

**58**  And her neighbours and her [[#^note-58a|cousins]] heard how the Lord had shewed great [[#^note-58b|mercy]] upon her; and they rejoiced with her. ^verse-58

**59**  And it came to pass, that on the [[#^note-59a|eighth]] day they came to [[#^note-59b|circumcise]] the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. ^verse-59

**60**  And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. ^verse-60

**61**  And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. ^verse-61

**62**  And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. ^verse-62

**63**  And he asked for a [[#^note-63a|writing table]], and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. ^verse-63

**64**  And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. ^verse-64

**65**  And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were [[#^note-65a|noised]] abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa. ^verse-65

**66**  And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. ^verse-66

**67**  And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and [[#^note-67a|prophesied]], saying, ^verse-67

**68**  [[#^note-68a|Blessed]] be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath [[#^note-68b|visited]] and [[#^note-68c|redeemed]] his people, ^verse-68

**69**  And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; ^verse-69

**70**  As he [[#^note-70a|spake]] by the mouth of his holy [[#^note-70b|prophets]], which have been since the world began: ^verse-70

**71**  That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; ^verse-71

**72**  To perform the mercy [[#^note-72a|promised]] to our fathers, and to remember his holy [[#^note-72b|covenant]]; ^verse-72

**73**  The [[#^note-73a|oath]] which he sware to our [[#^note-73b|father]] Abraham, ^verse-73

**74**  That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without [[#^note-74a|fear]], ^verse-74

**75**  In [[#^note-75a|holiness]] and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. ^verse-75

**76**  And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to [[#^note-76a|prepare]] his ways; ^verse-76

**77**  To give [[#^note-77a|knowledge]] of salvation unto his people by the [[#^note-77b|remission]] of their sins, ^verse-77

**78**  Through the [[#^note-78a|tender]] mercy of our God; whereby the [[#^note-78b|dayspring]] from on high hath visited us, ^verse-78

**79**  To give [[#^note-79a|light]] to them that sit in [[#^note-79b|darkness]] and in the shadow of [[#^note-79c|death]], to guide our feet into the way of peace. ^verse-79

**80**  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel. ^verse-80
