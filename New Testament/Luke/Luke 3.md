*John the Baptist preaches and baptizes—Jesus is baptized, and God acclaims Him as His Son—Jesus' genealogy back to Adam is given.*

**1**  Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and [[#^note-1a|Herod]] being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituræa and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, ^verse-1

**2**    [[#^note-2a|Annas]] and Caiaphas being the [[#^note-2b|high priests]], the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. ^verse-2

**3**  And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the [[#^note-3a|baptism]] of repentance for the [[#^note-3b|remission]] of sins; ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|As]] it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The [[#^note-4b|voice]] of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. ^verse-4

**5**  Every [[#^note-5a|valley]] shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; ^verse-5

**6**  And all flesh shall see the [[#^note-6a|salvation]] of God. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O [[#^note-7a|generation]] of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? ^verse-7

**8**  Bring forth therefore [[#^note-8a|fruits]] [[#^note-8b|worthy]] of [[#^note-8c|repentance]], and begin not to say within yourselves, [[#^note-8d|We]] have [[#^note-8e|Abraham]] to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. ^verse-8

**9**  And now also the [[#^note-9a|axe]] is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good [[#^note-9b|fruit]] is hewn down, and cast into the fire. ^verse-9

**10**  And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? ^verse-10

**11**  He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two [[#^note-11a|coats]], let him [[#^note-11b|impart]] to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. ^verse-11

**12**  Then came also [[#^note-12a|publicans]] to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|And]] he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. ^verse-13

**14**  And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any [[#^note-14a|falsely]]; and be [[#^note-14b|content]] with your [[#^note-14c|wages]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And as the people were in expectation, and all men [[#^note-15a|mused]] in their hearts of [[#^note-15b|John]], whether he were the Christ, or not; ^verse-15

**16**  John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed [[#^note-16a|baptize]] you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: ^verse-16

**17**  Whose [[#^note-17a|fan]] is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his [[#^note-17b|garner]]; but the [[#^note-17c|chaff]] he will burn with fire unquenchable. ^verse-17

**18**  And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. ^verse-18

**19**  But [[#^note-19a|Herod]] the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, ^verse-19

**20**  Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. ^verse-20

**21**  Now when all the people were [[#^note-21a|baptized]], it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, ^verse-21

**22**  And the [[#^note-22a|Holy Ghost]] descended in a bodily shape like a [[#^note-22b|dove]] upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. ^verse-22

**23**  And [[#^note-23a|Jesus]] himself began to be about [[#^note-23b|thirty]] years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of [[#^note-23c|Joseph]], which was the son of Heli, ^verse-23

**33**  Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of [[#^note-33a|Phares]], which was the son of [[#^note-33b|Juda]], ^verse-33

**34**  Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of [[#^note-34a|Abraham]], which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, ^verse-34

**35**  Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, ^verse-35
