[[New Testament/Luke/Luke 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Luke/Luke 16|Next Entry]]

*Jesus gives the parables of the lost sheep, the piece of silver, and the prodigal son.*

**1**  Then drew near unto him all the [[#^note-1a|publicans]] and sinners for to hear him. ^verse-1

**2**    And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And he spake this parable unto them, saying, ^verse-3

**4**  What man of you, hav[[#^note-4a|in]]g an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is [[#^note-4b|lost]], until he find it? ^verse-4

**5**  And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. ^verse-5

**6**  And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. ^verse-6

**7**  I say unto you, that likewise [[#^note-7a|joy]] shall be in heaven over one [[#^note-7b|sinner]] that [[#^note-7c|repenteth]], more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ Either what woman having ten [[#^note-8a|piece]]s of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? ^verse-8

**9**  And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. ^verse-9

**10**  Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the [[#^note-10a|angels]] of God over one [[#^note-10b|sinner]] that repenteth. ^verse-10

**11**    ¶ And he said, A certain man had two sons: ^verse-11

**12**  And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of [[#^note-12a|goods]] that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. ^verse-12

**13**  And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there [[#^note-13a|wasted]] his [[#^note-13b|substance]] with [[#^note-13c|riotous]] living. ^verse-13

**14**  And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. ^verse-14

**15**  And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. ^verse-15

**16**  And he [[#^note-16a|would fain]] have filled his belly with the [[#^note-16b|husks]] that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. ^verse-16

**17**  And when he [[#^note-17a|came]] to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! ^verse-17

**18**  I will [[#^note-18a|arise]] and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have [[#^note-18b|sinned]] against heaven, and before thee, ^verse-18

**19**  And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. ^verse-19

**20**  And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had [[#^note-20a|compassion]], and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. ^verse-20

**21**  And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more [[#^note-21a|worthy]] to be called thy [[#^note-21b|son]]. ^verse-21

**22**  But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: ^verse-22

**23**  And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: ^verse-23

**24**  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. ^verse-24

**25**  Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. ^verse-25

**26**  And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. ^verse-26

**27**  And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. ^verse-27

**28**  And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him. ^verse-28

**29**  And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: ^verse-29

**30**  But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. ^verse-30

**31**  And he said unto him, [[#^note-31a|Son]], thou art ever with me, and [[#^note-31b|all]] that I have is thine. ^verse-31

**32**  It was [[#^note-32a|meet]] that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. ^verse-32
