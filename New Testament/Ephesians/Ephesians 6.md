### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Philippians|Next Entry]]

*Children should honor their parents—Servants and masters are judged by the same law—Saints should put on the whole armor of God.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Children]], [[#^note-1b|obey]] your parents in the Lord: for this is right. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Honour]] thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) ^verse-2

**3**  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. ^verse-3

**4**  And, ye [[#^note-4a|fathers]], [[#^note-4b|provoke]] not your [[#^note-4c|children]] to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Servants]], be obedient to them that are your [[#^note-5b|masters]] according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; ^verse-5

**6**  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the [[#^note-6a|servants]] of Christ, doing the [[#^note-6b|will]] of God from the heart; ^verse-6

**7**  With good will doing [[#^note-7a|service]], as to the Lord, and not to men: ^verse-7

**8**  Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he [[#^note-8a|receive]] of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. ^verse-8

**9**  And, ye [[#^note-9a|masters]], do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your [[#^note-9b|Master]] also is in heaven; neither is there [[#^note-9c|respect]] of persons with him. ^verse-9

**10**  Finally, my brethren, be [[#^note-10a|strong]] in the Lord, and in the power of his might. ^verse-10

**11**    Put on the whole [[#^note-11a|armour]] of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. ^verse-11

**12**  For we [[#^note-12a|wrestle]] not [[#^note-12b|against]] [[#^note-12c|flesh and blood]], but against principalities, against powers, against the [[#^note-12d|rulers]] of the [[#^note-12e|darkness]] of this world, against spiritual [[#^note-12f|wickedness]] in high places. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. ^verse-13

**14**  Stand therefore, having your loins [[#^note-14a|girt]] about with [[#^note-14b|truth]], and having on the [[#^note-14c|breastplate]] of [[#^note-14d|righteousness]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of [[#^note-15a|peace]]; ^verse-15

**16**  Above all, taking the shield of [[#^note-16a|faith]], wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery [[#^note-16b|darts]] of the wicked. ^verse-16

**17**  And take the helmet of [[#^note-17a|salvation]], and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Praying]] always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all [[#^note-18b|perseverance]] and supplication for all saints; ^verse-18

**19**  And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the [[#^note-19a|mystery]] of the gospel, ^verse-19

**20**  For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak [[#^note-20a|boldly]], as I ought to speak. ^verse-20

**21**  But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, [[#^note-21a|Tychicus]], a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: ^verse-21

**22**  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. ^verse-22

**23**  Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-23

**24**  Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in [[#^note-24a|sincerity]]. Amen. ^verse-24
