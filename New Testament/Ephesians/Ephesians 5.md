### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 6|Next Entry]]

*The Saints are exhorted to avoid uncleanness and walk uprightlyâ€”Husbands and wives should love each other.*

**1**  Be ye therefore [[#^note-1a|followers]] of God, as dear children; ^verse-1

**2**  And [[#^note-2a|walk]] in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an [[#^note-2b|offering]] and a [[#^note-2c|sacrifice]] to God for a sweetsmelling [[#^note-2d|savour]]. ^verse-2

**3**  But [[#^note-3a|fornication]], and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh [[#^note-3b|saints]]; ^verse-3

**4**  Neither [[#^note-4a|filthiness]], nor [[#^note-4b|foolish]] [[#^note-4c|talking]], nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. ^verse-4

**5**  For this ye know, that no [[#^note-5a|whoremonger]], nor [[#^note-5b|unclean]] person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any [[#^note-5c|inheritance]] in the kingdom of Christ and of God. ^verse-5

**6**  Let no man [[#^note-6a|deceive]] you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the [[#^note-6b|wrath]] of God upon the children of [[#^note-6c|disobedience]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Be not ye therefore partakers with them. ^verse-7

**8**  For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as [[#^note-8a|children]] of [[#^note-8b|light]]: ^verse-8

**9**  (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all [[#^note-9a|goodness]] and righteousness and truth;) ^verse-9

**10**  Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  And have no [[#^note-11a|fellowship]] with the unfruitful works of [[#^note-11b|darkness]], but rather [[#^note-11c|reprove]] them. ^verse-11

**12**  For it is a [[#^note-12a|shame]] even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. ^verse-12

**13**  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee [[#^note-14a|light]]. ^verse-14

**15**  See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, ^verse-15

**16**  Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore be ye not [[#^note-17a|unwise]], but understanding what the will of the Lord is. ^verse-17

**18**  And be not [[#^note-18a|drunk]] with wine, wherein is [[#^note-18b|excess]]; but be filled with the Spirit; ^verse-18

**19**  Speaking to yourselves in psalms and [[#^note-19a|hymns]] and spiritual songs, singing and making [[#^note-19b|melody]] in your heart to the Lord; ^verse-19

**20**  Giving [[#^note-20a|thanks]] always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Submitting]] yourselves one to another in the fear of God. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Wives]], [[#^note-22b|submit]] yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  For the [[#^note-23a|husband]] is the [[#^note-23b|head]] of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the [[#^note-23c|church]]: and he is the saviour of the body. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Husbands]], [[#^note-25b|love]] your [[#^note-25c|wives]], even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; ^verse-25

**26**  That he might [[#^note-26a|sanctify]] and [[#^note-26b|cleanse]] it with the washing of water by the word, ^verse-26

**27**  That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. ^verse-27

**28**  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his [[#^note-28a|wife]] loveth himself. ^verse-28

**29**  For no man ever yet [[#^note-29a|hated]] his own [[#^note-29b|flesh]]; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: ^verse-29

**30**  For we are [[#^note-30a|members]] of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. ^verse-30

**31**  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be [[#^note-31a|one]] flesh. ^verse-31

**32**  This is a great [[#^note-32a|mystery]]: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. ^verse-32

**33**  Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his [[#^note-33a|wife]] even as himself; and the wife see that she [[#^note-33b|reverence]] her husband. ^verse-33
