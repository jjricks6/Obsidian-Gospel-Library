### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Ephesians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 2|Next Entry]]

*The Saints are foreordained to receive the gospel—The gospel is to be restored in the latter days—The Saints are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise—They know God and Christ by revelation.*

**1**  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the [[#^note-1a|saints]] which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: ^verse-1

**2**  Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all [[#^note-3a|spiritual]] blessings in heavenly places in Christ: ^verse-3

**4**  According as he hath [[#^note-4a|chosen]] us in him [[#^note-4b|before]] the foundation of the world, that we should be [[#^note-4c|holy]] and without blame before him in love: ^verse-4

**5**  Having [[#^note-5a|predestinated]] us unto the [[#^note-5b|adoption]] of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, ^verse-5

**6**  To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. ^verse-6

**7**  In whom we have [[#^note-7a|redemption]] through his blood, the [[#^note-7b|forgiveness]] of sins, according to the [[#^note-7c|riches]] of his [[#^note-7d|grace]]; ^verse-7

**8**  Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all [[#^note-8a|wisdom]] and [[#^note-8b|prudence]]; ^verse-8

**9**  Having made known unto us the [[#^note-9a|mystery]] of his [[#^note-9b|will]], according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: ^verse-9

**10**  That in the [[#^note-10a|dispensation]] of the fulness of times he might [[#^note-10b|gather]] together in one [[#^note-10c|all]] things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: ^verse-10

**11**  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being [[#^note-11a|predestinated]] according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: ^verse-11

**12**  That we should be to the praise of his glory, who [[#^note-12a|first trusted]] in Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the [[#^note-13a|gospel]] of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were [[#^note-13b|sealed]] with that holy Spirit of [[#^note-13c|promise]], ^verse-13

**14**  Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore I also, after I heard of your [[#^note-15a|faith]] in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, ^verse-15

**16**  Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; ^verse-16

**17**  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of [[#^note-17a|wisdom]] and [[#^note-17b|revelation]] in the knowledge of him: ^verse-17

**18**  The eyes of your [[#^note-18a|understanding]] being [[#^note-18b|enlightened]]; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the [[#^note-18c|riches]] of the glory of his [[#^note-18d|inheritance]] in the saints, ^verse-18

**19**  And what is the exceeding greatness of his [[#^note-19a|power]] to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, ^verse-19

**20**  Which he wrought in Christ, when he [[#^note-20a|raised]] him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the [[#^note-20b|heavenly]] places, ^verse-20

**21**  Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every [[#^note-21a|name]] that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: ^verse-21

**22**  And hath put [[#^note-22a|all]] things under his [[#^note-22b|feet]], and gave him to be the [[#^note-22c|head]] over all things to the [[#^note-22d|church]], ^verse-22

**23**  Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. ^verse-23
