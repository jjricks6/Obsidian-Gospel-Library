### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 5|Next Entry]]

*There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism—Apostles and prophets are essential to the Church—The Saints are exhorted to live righteously—They are sealed unto the day of redemption.*

**1**    I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk [[#^note-1a|worthy]] of the [[#^note-1b|vocation]] wherewith ye are called, ^verse-1

**2**  With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, [[#^note-2a|forbearing]] one another in love; ^verse-2

**3**  Endeavouring to keep the [[#^note-3a|unity]] of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ^verse-3

**4**  There is one [[#^note-4a|body]], and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; ^verse-4

**5**  One Lord, one [[#^note-5a|faith]], one [[#^note-5b|baptism]], ^verse-5

**6**  One God and [[#^note-6a|Father]] of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. ^verse-6

**7**  But unto every one of us is given [[#^note-7a|grace]] according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore he saith, When he [[#^note-8a|ascended]] up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. ^verse-8

**9**  (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? ^verse-9

**10**  He that descended is the same also that [[#^note-10a|ascended]] up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) ^verse-10

**11**  And he [[#^note-11a|gave]] some, [[#^note-11b|apostles]]; and some, [[#^note-11c|prophets]]; and some, [[#^note-11d|evangelists]]; and some, [[#^note-11e|pastors]] and [[#^note-11f|teachers]]; ^verse-11

**12**  For the [[#^note-12a|perfecting]] of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the [[#^note-12b|edifying]] of the body of Christ: ^verse-12

**13**  Till we all come in the [[#^note-13a|unity]] of the faith, and of the [[#^note-13b|knowledge]] of the Son of God, unto a [[#^note-13c|perfect]] man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: ^verse-13

**14**  That we henceforth be no more [[#^note-14a|children]], tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of [[#^note-14b|doctrine]], by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; ^verse-14

**15**  But speaking the [[#^note-15a|truth]] in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the [[#^note-15b|head]], even Christ: ^verse-15

**16**  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. ^verse-16

**17**  This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other [[#^note-17a|Gentiles]] walk, in the [[#^note-17b|vanity]] of their [[#^note-17c|mind]], ^verse-17

**18**  Having the [[#^note-18a|understanding]] darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the [[#^note-18b|ignorance]] that is in them, because of the [[#^note-18c|blindness]] of their [[#^note-18d|heart]]: ^verse-18

**19**  Who being [[#^note-19a|past]] [[#^note-19b|feeling]] have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. ^verse-19

**20**  But ye have not so learned Christ; ^verse-20

**21**  If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: ^verse-21

**22**  That ye [[#^note-22a|put]] off concerning the former conversation the [[#^note-22b|old]] man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful [[#^note-22c|lusts]]; ^verse-22

**23**  And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; ^verse-23

**24**  And that ye put on the [[#^note-24a|new man]], which after God is created in [[#^note-24b|righteousness]] and true holiness. ^verse-24

**25**  Wherefore putting away [[#^note-25a|lying]], speak every man [[#^note-25b|truth]] with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|Be]] ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your [[#^note-26b|wrath]]: ^verse-26

**27**  Neither give place to the [[#^note-27a|devil]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Let him that stole [[#^note-28a|steal]] no more: but rather let him [[#^note-28b|labour]], working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to [[#^note-28c|give]] to him that needeth. ^verse-28

**29**  Let no corrupt [[#^note-29a|communication]] proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. ^verse-29

**30**  And [[#^note-30a|grieve]] not the holy [[#^note-30b|Spirit]] of God, whereby ye are [[#^note-30c|sealed]] unto the day of redemption. ^verse-30

**31**  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and [[#^note-31a|anger]], and clamour, and [[#^note-31b|evil]] [[#^note-31c|speaking]], be put away from you, with all [[#^note-31d|malice]]: ^verse-31

**32**  And be ye [[#^note-32a|kind]] one to another, tenderhearted, [[#^note-32b|forgiving]] one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. ^verse-32
