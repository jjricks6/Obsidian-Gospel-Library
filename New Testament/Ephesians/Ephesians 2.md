### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians 3|Next Entry]]

*We are saved by grace through faith—The blood of Christ saves Jew and Gentile alike—The Church is built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets.*

**1**  And you hath he quickened, who were [[#^note-1a|dead]] in trespasses and sins; ^verse-1

**2**  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this [[#^note-2a|world]], according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of [[#^note-2b|disobedience]]: ^verse-2

**3**  Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the [[#^note-3a|lusts]] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by [[#^note-3b|nature]] the children of wrath, even as others. ^verse-3

**4**  But God, who is rich in [[#^note-4a|mercy]], for his great love wherewith he loved us, ^verse-4

**5**  Even when we were dead in sins, hath [[#^note-5a|quickened]] us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) ^verse-5

**6**  And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: ^verse-6

**7**  That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding [[#^note-7a|riches]] of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. ^verse-7

**8**  For by [[#^note-8a|grace]] are ye [[#^note-8b|saved]] through [[#^note-8c|faith]]; and that not of yourselves: it is the [[#^note-8d|gift]] of God: ^verse-8

**9**  Not of works, lest any man should [[#^note-9a|boast]]. ^verse-9

**10**    For we are his [[#^note-10a|workmanship]], created in Christ Jesus unto good [[#^note-10b|works]], which God hath before ordained that we should [[#^note-10c|walk]] in them. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called [[#^note-11a|Uncircumcision]] by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; ^verse-11

**12**  That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and [[#^note-12a|strangers]] from the [[#^note-12b|covenants]] of promise, having no [[#^note-12c|hope]], and [[#^note-12d|without]] God in the world: ^verse-12

**13**  But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. ^verse-13

**14**  For he is our [[#^note-14a|peace]], who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle [[#^note-14b|wall]] of partition between us; ^verse-14

**15**  Having [[#^note-15a|abolished]] in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in [[#^note-15b|ordinances]]; for to make in himself of twain one [[#^note-15c|new man]], so making peace; ^verse-15

**16**  And that he might [[#^note-16a|reconcile]] both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: ^verse-16

**17**  And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. ^verse-17

**18**  For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. ^verse-18

**19**    Now therefore ye are no more [[#^note-19a|strangers]] and foreigners, but [[#^note-19b|fellowcitizens]] with the [[#^note-19c|saints]], and of the [[#^note-19d|household]] of God; ^verse-19

**20**  And are built upon the foundation of the [[#^note-20a|apostles]] and [[#^note-20b|prophets]], Jesus Christ himself being the chief [[#^note-20c|corner stone]]; ^verse-20

**21**  In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: ^verse-21

**22**  In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. ^verse-22
