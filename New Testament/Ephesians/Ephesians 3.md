*The Gentiles are fellow heirs with Israelâ€”The love of Christ surpasses all understanding.*

**1**  For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, ^verse-1

**2**  If ye have heard of the [[#^note-2a|dispensation]] of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: ^verse-2

**3**  How that by revelation he made [[#^note-3a|known]] unto me the mystery; (as I [[#^note-3b|wrote]] afore in few words, ^verse-3

**4**  Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the [[#^note-4a|mystery]] of Christ) ^verse-4

**5**  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now [[#^note-5a|revealed]] unto his holy apostles and [[#^note-5b|prophets]] by the Spirit; ^verse-5

**6**  That the [[#^note-6a|Gentiles]] should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: ^verse-6

**7**  Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. ^verse-7

**8**  Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this [[#^note-8a|grace]] given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable [[#^note-8b|riches]] of Christ; ^verse-8

**9**  And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the [[#^note-9a|mystery]], which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who [[#^note-9b|created]] all things by [[#^note-9c|Jesus Christ]]: ^verse-9

**10**  To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, ^verse-10

**11**  According to the eternal [[#^note-11a|purpose]] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: ^verse-11

**12**  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. ^verse-13

**14**  For this cause I bow my knees unto the [[#^note-14a|Father]] of our Lord Jesus Christ, ^verse-14

**15**  Of whom the whole [[#^note-15a|family]] in heaven and earth is named, ^verse-15

**16**  That he would grant you, according to the [[#^note-16a|riches]] of his glory, to be [[#^note-16b|strengthened]] with might by his Spirit in the inner man; ^verse-16

**17**  That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being [[#^note-17a|rooted]] and [[#^note-17b|grounded]] in love, ^verse-17

**18**  May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; ^verse-18

**19**  And to know the [[#^note-19a|love]] of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. ^verse-19

**20**  Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, ^verse-20

**21**  Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, [[#^note-21a|world]] without end. Amen. ^verse-21
