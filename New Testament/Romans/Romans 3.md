### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 4|Next Entry]]

*Man is not justified by the law of Mosesâ€”He is justified through righteousness, which comes through faith in Christ, made possible through Christ's atoning sacrifice.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|What]] [[#^note-1b|advantage]] then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of [[#^note-1c|circumcision]]? ^verse-1

**2**  Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the [[#^note-2a|oracles]] of God. ^verse-2

**3**  For what if some did not believe? shall their [[#^note-3a|unbelief]] make the faith of God without effect? ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|God forbid]]: yea, let God be true, but every man a [[#^note-4b|liar]]; as it is written, That thou mightest be [[#^note-4c|justified]] in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|But]] if our unrighteousness [[#^note-5b|commend]] the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God [[#^note-5c|unrighteous]] who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|God forbid]]: for then how shall God [[#^note-6b|judge]] the world? ^verse-6

**7**  For if the truth of God hath more abounded [[#^note-7a|through]] my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? ^verse-7

**8**  And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose [[#^note-8a|damnation]] is just. ^verse-8

**9**  What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; ^verse-9

**10**  As it is written, There is [[#^note-10a|none]] [[#^note-10b|righteous]], no, not one: ^verse-10

**11**  There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. ^verse-11

**12**  They are all gone out of the [[#^note-12a|way]], they are together become [[#^note-12b|unprofitable]]; there is none that doeth [[#^note-12c|good]], no, not one. ^verse-12

**13**  Their [[#^note-13a|throat]] is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the [[#^note-13b|poison]] of asps is under their lips: ^verse-13

**14**  Whose mouth is full of cursing and [[#^note-14a|bitterness]]: ^verse-14

**15**  Their feet are swift to [[#^note-15a|shed]] blood: ^verse-15

**16**  Destruction and [[#^note-16a|misery]] are in their ways: ^verse-16

**17**  And the way of [[#^note-17a|peace]] have they not known: ^verse-17

**18**  There is no [[#^note-18a|fear]] of God before their eyes. ^verse-18

**19**  Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every [[#^note-19a|mouth]] may be stopped, and all the world may become [[#^note-19b|guilty]] before God. ^verse-19

**20**  Therefore by the [[#^note-20a|deeds]] of the [[#^note-20b|law]] there shall no flesh be [[#^note-20c|justified]] in his sight: for [[#^note-20d|by]] the law is the knowledge of sin. ^verse-20

**21**  But now the [[#^note-21a|righteousness]] of God [[#^note-21b|without]] the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; ^verse-21

**22**  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: ^verse-22

**23**  For all have [[#^note-23a|sinned]], and come short of the glory of God; ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Being]] [[#^note-24b|justified]] freely by his [[#^note-24c|grace]] through the [[#^note-24d|redemption]] that is in Christ Jesus: ^verse-24

**25**  Whom God hath [[#^note-25a|set forth]] to be a [[#^note-25b|propitiation]] through faith in his [[#^note-25c|blood]], to declare his righteousness for the [[#^note-25d|remission]] of sins that are past, through the [[#^note-25e|forbearance]] of God; ^verse-25

**26**  To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be [[#^note-26a|just]], and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. ^verse-26

**27**  Where is [[#^note-27a|boasting]] then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. ^verse-27

**28**  Therefore we conclude that a man is [[#^note-28a|justified]] by [[#^note-28b|faith]] [[#^note-28c|without]] the deeds of the law. ^verse-28

**29**  Is he the [[#^note-29a|God]] of the Jews only? is he not also of the [[#^note-29b|Gentiles]]? Yes, of the Gentiles also: ^verse-29

**30**  Seeing it is [[#^note-30a|one God]], which shall justify the [[#^note-30b|circumcision]] by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. ^verse-30

**31**  Do we then make void the law through faith? [[#^note-31a|God forbid]]: [[#^note-31b|yea]], we establish the law. ^verse-31
