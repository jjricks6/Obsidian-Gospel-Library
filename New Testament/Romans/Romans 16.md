[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians|Next Entry]]

*Paul sends greetings to various Saints—He counsels the Saints to avoid those who cause divisions—The Saints should be wise concerning good and innocent concerning evil.*

**1**  I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: ^verse-1

**2**  That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also. ^verse-2

**3**  Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: ^verse-3

**4**  Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. ^verse-4

**5**  Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epænetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. ^verse-6

**7**  Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. ^verse-7

**8**  Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. ^verse-9

**10**  Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' [[#^note-10a|household]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the [[#^note-11a|household]] of Narcissus, which are in the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. ^verse-13

**14**  Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. ^verse-14

**15**  Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them. ^verse-15

**16**  Salute one another with an holy [[#^note-16a|kiss]]. The [[#^note-16b|churches]] of Christ salute you. ^verse-16

**17**  Now I beseech you, brethren, [[#^note-17a|mark]] them which cause [[#^note-17b|divisions]] and [[#^note-17c|offences]] contrary to the [[#^note-17d|doctrine]] which ye have learned; and [[#^note-17e|avoid]] them. ^verse-17

**18**  For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and [[#^note-18a|fair]] speeches deceive the hearts of the [[#^note-18b|simple]]. ^verse-18

**19**  For your [[#^note-19a|obedience]] is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you [[#^note-19b|wise]] unto that which is good, and [[#^note-19c|simple]] concerning evil. ^verse-19

**20**  And the God of [[#^note-20a|peace]] shall [[#^note-20b|bruise]] [[#^note-20c|Satan]] under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. ^verse-20

**21**  Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. ^verse-21

**22**  I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. ^verse-23

**24**  The [[#^note-24a|grace]] of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. ^verse-24

**25**  Now to him that is of power to [[#^note-25a|stablish]] you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the [[#^note-25b|mystery]], which was kept secret since the world began, ^verse-25

**26**  But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the [[#^note-26a|everlasting]] God, made known to all nations for the [[#^note-26b|obedience]] of faith: ^verse-26

**27**  To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. ^verse-27
