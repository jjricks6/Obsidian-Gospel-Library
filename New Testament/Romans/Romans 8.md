### Chapter 8

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 9|Next Entry]]

*The law of Christ brings life and peace—Those adopted as children of God become joint heirs with Christ—God's elect are foreordained to eternal life—Christ makes intercession for man.*

**1**  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who [[#^note-1a|walk]] not after the [[#^note-1b|flesh]], but after the [[#^note-1c|Spirit]]. ^verse-1

**2**  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me [[#^note-2a|free]] from the law of sin and death. ^verse-2

**3**  For what the law could not do, in that it was [[#^note-3a|weak]] through the [[#^note-3b|flesh]], God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: ^verse-3

**4**  That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the [[#^note-4a|Spirit]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For they that are after the flesh do [[#^note-5a|mind]] the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. ^verse-5

**6**  For to be [[#^note-6a|carnally]] minded is [[#^note-6b|death]]; but to be [[#^note-6c|spiritually]] minded is life and [[#^note-6d|peace]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Because the [[#^note-7a|carnal]] mind is [[#^note-7b|enmity]] against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. ^verse-7

**8**  So then they that are [[#^note-8a|in the flesh]] cannot please God. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|But]] ye are not in the flesh, but in the [[#^note-9b|Spirit]], if so be that the Spirit of God [[#^note-9c|dwell]] in you. Now if any man have not the [[#^note-9d|Spirit of Christ]], he is none of his. ^verse-9

**10**  And if [[#^note-10a|Christ]] be in you, [[#^note-10b|the]] body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of [[#^note-10c|righteousness]]. ^verse-10

**11**  But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also [[#^note-11a|quicken]] your [[#^note-11b|mortal]] bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. ^verse-12

**13**  For if ye live after the flesh, ye [[#^note-13a|shall die]]: but if ye through the Spirit do [[#^note-13b|mortify]] the deeds of the body, ye shall live. ^verse-13

**14**  For as many as are [[#^note-14a|led]] by the [[#^note-14b|Spirit]] of God, they are the [[#^note-14c|sons]] of God. ^verse-14

**15**  For ye have not received the spirit of [[#^note-15a|bondage]] again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of [[#^note-15b|adoption]], whereby we cry, Abba, Father. ^verse-15

**16**  The Spirit itself beareth [[#^note-16a|witness]] with our [[#^note-16b|spirit]], that we are the [[#^note-16c|children]] of God: ^verse-16

**17**  And if children, then [[#^note-17a|heirs]]; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we [[#^note-17b|suffer]] with him, that we may be also glorified together. ^verse-17

**18**  For I reckon that the [[#^note-18a|sufferings]] of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the [[#^note-18b|glory]] which shall be revealed [[#^note-18c|in us]]. ^verse-18

**19**  For the [[#^note-19a|earnest expectation]] of the [[#^note-19b|creature]] waiteth for the [[#^note-19c|manifestation]] of the sons of God. ^verse-19

**20**  For the creature was made subject to [[#^note-20a|vanity]], not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, ^verse-20

**21**  Because the [[#^note-21a|creature]] itself also shall be [[#^note-21b|delivered]] from the bondage of [[#^note-21c|corruption]] into the glorious [[#^note-21d|liberty]] of the children of God. ^verse-21

**22**  For we know that the whole creation [[#^note-22a|groaneth]] and travaileth in pain together until now. ^verse-22

**23**  And not only they, but ourselves also, [[#^note-23a|which]] have the [[#^note-23b|firstfruits]] of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the [[#^note-23c|adoption]], to wit, the redemption of our body. ^verse-23

**24**  For we are saved by [[#^note-24a|hope]]: but hope that is [[#^note-24b|seen]] is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? ^verse-24

**25**  But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. ^verse-25

**26**  Likewise the Spirit also [[#^note-26a|helpeth]] our infirmities: for we know not what we should [[#^note-26b|pray]] for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh [[#^note-26c|intercession]] for us with [[#^note-26d|groanings]] which cannot be uttered. ^verse-26

**27**  And he that [[#^note-27a|searcheth]] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh [[#^note-27b|intercession]] for the saints according to the will of God. ^verse-27

**28**  And we know that all things work together for [[#^note-28a|good]] to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. ^verse-28

**29**  [[#^note-29a|For]] whom he did [[#^note-29b|foreknow]], he also [[#^note-29c|did predestinate]] [[#^note-29d|to be conformed to]] the [[#^note-29e|image]] of his Son, that he might be the [[#^note-29f|firstborn]] among many brethren. ^verse-29

**30**  Moreover whom he [[#^note-30a|did predestinate]], them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. ^verse-30

**31**  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can [[#^note-31a|be against us]]? ^verse-31

**32**  He that spared not his own [[#^note-32a|Son]], but [[#^note-32b|delivered]] him up for us [[#^note-32c|all]], how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? ^verse-32

**33**  Who shall [[#^note-33a|lay]] any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. ^verse-33

**34**  Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh [[#^note-34a|intercession]] for us. ^verse-34

**35**  Who shall separate us from the [[#^note-35a|love]] of Christ? shall [[#^note-35b|tribulation]], or distress, or [[#^note-35c|persecution]], or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ^verse-35

**36**  As it is written, For thy sake we are [[#^note-36a|killed]] all the day long; we are accounted as [[#^note-36b|sheep]] for the slaughter. ^verse-36

**37**  Nay, in all these things we are [[#^note-37a|more]] than [[#^note-37b|conquerors]] through him that loved us. ^verse-37

**38**  For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, ^verse-38

**39**  Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to [[#^note-39a|separate]] us from the [[#^note-39b|love]] of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ^verse-39
