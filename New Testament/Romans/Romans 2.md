[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 3|Next Entry]]

*God will render to every person according to his or her deedsâ€”Both Jews and Gentiles will be judged by gospel laws.*

**1**  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that [[#^note-1a|judgest]]: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. ^verse-1

**2**  But we [[#^note-2a|are sure]] that the [[#^note-2b|judgment]] of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. ^verse-2

**3**  And thinkest thou this, O man, that [[#^note-3a|judgest]] them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the [[#^note-3b|judgment]] of God? ^verse-3

**4**  Or despisest thou the [[#^note-4a|riches]] of his [[#^note-4b|goodness]] and [[#^note-4c|forbearance]] and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? ^verse-4

**5**  But [[#^note-5a|after]] thy [[#^note-5b|hardness]] and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; ^verse-5

**6**  Who will [[#^note-6a|render]] to every man [[#^note-6b|according]] to his [[#^note-6c|deeds]]: ^verse-6

**7**  To them who by [[#^note-7a|patient]] [[#^note-7b|continuance]] in well doing seek for glory and honour and [[#^note-7c|immortality]], eternal life: ^verse-7

**8**  But unto them that are [[#^note-8a|contentious]], and do not [[#^note-8b|obey]] the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [[#^note-8c|indignation]] and wrath, ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Tribulation]] and [[#^note-9b|anguish]], upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the [[#^note-9c|Gentile]]; ^verse-9

**10**  But glory, honour, and [[#^note-10a|peace]], to every man that [[#^note-10b|worketh]] good, to the Jew first, and also to the [[#^note-10c|Gentile]]: ^verse-10

**11**  For there is no [[#^note-11a|respect]] of [[#^note-11b|persons]] with God. ^verse-11

**12**  For as many as have sinned without [[#^note-12a|law]] shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; ^verse-12

**13**  (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the [[#^note-13a|doers]] of the law shall be [[#^note-13b|justified]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Which]] shew the work of the [[#^note-15b|law]] written in their hearts, their [[#^note-15c|conscience]] also bearing [[#^note-15d|witness]], and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) ^verse-15

**16**  In the day when God shall [[#^note-16a|judge]] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my [[#^note-16b|gospel]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, ^verse-17

**18**  And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; ^verse-18

**19**  And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, ^verse-19

**20**  An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the [[#^note-20a|form]] of knowledge and of the truth in the law. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou therefore which [[#^note-21a|teachest]] another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that [[#^note-21b|preachest]] a man should not [[#^note-21c|steal]], dost thou steal? ^verse-21

**22**  Thou that sayest a man should not commit [[#^note-22a|adultery]], dost thou [[#^note-22b|commit]] adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit [[#^note-22c|sacrilege]]? ^verse-22

**23**  Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? ^verse-23

**24**  For the name of God is [[#^note-24a|blasphemed]] among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. ^verse-24

**25**  For [[#^note-25a|circumcision]] verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? ^verse-26

**27**  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? ^verse-27

**28**  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: ^verse-28

**29**  But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and [[#^note-29a|circumcision]] is that of the heart, in the [[#^note-29b|spirit]], and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. ^verse-29
