### Chapter 9

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10|Next Entry]]

*Paul explains how the law of election (foreordination) operates—The people of Israel are chosen (foreordained) to receive the adoption, covenants, promises, and blessings of the gospel; yet they are not all Israel who are of Israel—They must seek their blessings by faith—The Gentiles also attain to righteousness and salvation by faith.*

**1**  I say the truth in Christ, I [[#^note-1a|lie]] not, my [[#^note-1b|conscience]] also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, ^verse-1

**2**  That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|For]] I could wish that myself were [[#^note-3b|accursed]] from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: ^verse-3

**4**  Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the [[#^note-4a|adoption]], and the glory, and the [[#^note-4b|covenants]], and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; ^verse-4

**5**  Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the [[#^note-5a|flesh]] Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. ^verse-5

**6**  Not as though the word of God [[#^note-6a|hath taken none effect]]. For they are not all [[#^note-6b|Israel]], which are of Israel: ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Neither]], because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In [[#^note-7b|Isaac]] shall thy seed be called. ^verse-7

**8**  That is, They which are the [[#^note-8a|children]] of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. ^verse-8

**9**  For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a [[#^note-9a|son]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And not only this; but when [[#^note-10a|Rebecca]] also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; ^verse-10

**11**  (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to [[#^note-11a|election]] might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) ^verse-11

**12**  It was said unto her, The [[#^note-12a|elder]] shall serve the younger. ^verse-12

**13**  As it is written, Jacob have I [[#^note-13a|loved]], but Esau have I hated. ^verse-13

**14**  What shall we say then? Is there [[#^note-14a|unrighteousness]] with God? [[#^note-14b|God forbid]]. ^verse-14

**15**  For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have [[#^note-15a|compassion]] on whom I will have compassion. ^verse-15

**16**  So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth [[#^note-16a|mercy]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same [[#^note-17a|purpose]] have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore hath he [[#^note-18a|mercy]] on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he [[#^note-18b|hardeneth]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? ^verse-19

**20**  Nay but, O man, who art thou that [[#^note-20a|repliest against]] God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou [[#^note-20b|made]] me thus? ^verse-20

**21**  Hath not the [[#^note-21a|potter]] power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? ^verse-21

**22**  What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to [[#^note-22a|destruction]]: ^verse-22

**23**  And that he might make known the [[#^note-23a|riches]] of his [[#^note-23b|glory]] on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, ^verse-23

**24**  Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? ^verse-24

**25**  As he saith also in [[#^note-25a|Osee]], I will call them my [[#^note-25b|people]], which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. ^verse-25

**26**  And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the [[#^note-26a|children]] of the living God. ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|Esaias]] also crieth concerning Israel, Though the [[#^note-27b|number]] of the children of [[#^note-27c|Israel]] be as the sand of the sea, a [[#^note-27d|remnant]] shall be saved: ^verse-27

**28**  For he will finish the work, and cut it short in [[#^note-28a|righteousness]]: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. ^verse-28

**29**  And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of [[#^note-29a|Sabaoth]] had left us a [[#^note-29b|seed]], we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. ^verse-29

**30**  What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after [[#^note-30a|righteousness]], have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. ^verse-30

**31**  But [[#^note-31a|Israel]], which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. ^verse-31

**32**  [[#^note-32a|Wherefore]]? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they [[#^note-32b|stumbled]] at that stumblingstone; ^verse-32

**33**  As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a [[#^note-33a|stumblingstone]] and [[#^note-33b|rock]] of [[#^note-33c|offence]]: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. ^verse-33
