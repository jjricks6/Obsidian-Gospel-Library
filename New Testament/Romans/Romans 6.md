### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 7|Next Entry]]

*Baptism is in similitude of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ—The wages of sin is death—Christ brings eternal life.*

**1**  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that [[#^note-1a|grace]] may abound? ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|God forbid]]. How shall we, that are dead to [[#^note-2b|sin]], live any longer therein? ^verse-2

**3**    Know ye not, that so many of us as were [[#^note-3a|baptized]] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore we are [[#^note-4a|buried]] with him by [[#^note-4b|baptism]] into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the [[#^note-4c|dead]] by the glory of the Father, even so we also should [[#^note-4d|walk]] in [[#^note-4e|newness]] of life. ^verse-4

**5**  For if we have been planted together in the [[#^note-5a|likeness]] of his [[#^note-5b|death]], we shall be also in the likeness of his [[#^note-5c|resurrection]]: ^verse-5

**6**  Knowing this, that our [[#^note-6a|old]] man is crucified with him, that the [[#^note-6b|body]] of sin might be [[#^note-6c|destroyed]], that henceforth we should not serve [[#^note-6d|sin]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For he that is [[#^note-7a|dead]] is [[#^note-7b|freed]] from sin. ^verse-7

**8**  Now if we be [[#^note-8a|dead]] with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: ^verse-8

**9**  Knowing that Christ being [[#^note-9a|raised]] from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. ^verse-9

**10**  For in that he died, he died unto [[#^note-10a|sin]] [[#^note-10b|once]]: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. ^verse-10

**11**  Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but [[#^note-11a|alive]] unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  Let not sin therefore reign in your [[#^note-12a|mortal]] body, that ye should obey it in the [[#^note-12b|lusts]] thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  Neither [[#^note-13a|yield]] ye your [[#^note-13b|members]] as [[#^note-13c|instruments]] of unrighteousness unto sin: but [[#^note-13d|yield]] yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of [[#^note-13e|righteousness]] unto God. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|For sin]] shall not have [[#^note-14b|dominion]] over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. ^verse-14

**15**  What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under [[#^note-15a|grace]]? [[#^note-15b|God forbid]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves [[#^note-16a|servants]] to [[#^note-16b|obey]], his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? ^verse-16

**17**  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have [[#^note-17a|obeyed]] from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. ^verse-17

**18**  Being then made [[#^note-18a|free]] from [[#^note-18b|sin]], ye became the servants of righteousness. ^verse-18

**19**  I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. ^verse-19

**20**  For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were [[#^note-20a|free from]] righteousness. ^verse-20

**21**  What [[#^note-21a|fruit]] had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. ^verse-21

**22**  But now being made [[#^note-22a|free]] from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your [[#^note-22b|fruit]] unto [[#^note-22c|holiness]], and the end everlasting life. ^verse-22

**23**  For the [[#^note-23a|wages]] of [[#^note-23b|sin]] is [[#^note-23c|death]]; but the [[#^note-23d|gift]] of God is [[#^note-23e|eternal life]] through Jesus Christ our Lord. ^verse-23
