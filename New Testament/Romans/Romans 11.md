### Chapter 11

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 10|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 12|Next Entry]]

*Israel was chosen (foreordained) according to the election of grace—But some harden their hearts against it—The Gentiles are adopted into the house of Israel—The gospel goes preferentially to the Gentiles until the fulness of the Gentiles.*

**1**  I say then, Hath God cast away his people? [[#^note-1a|God forbid]]. For I also am an [[#^note-1b|Israelite]], of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. ^verse-1

**2**  God hath not cast away his [[#^note-2a|people]] which he [[#^note-2b|foreknew]]. [[#^note-2c|Wot]] ye not what the scripture saith of [[#^note-2d|Elias]]? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, ^verse-2

**3**  Lord, they have [[#^note-3a|killed]] thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am [[#^note-3b|left]] alone, and they seek my life. ^verse-3

**4**  But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have [[#^note-4a|reserved]] to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. ^verse-4

**5**  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the [[#^note-5a|election]] of grace. ^verse-5

**6**  And if by [[#^note-6a|grace]], then is it no more of [[#^note-6b|works]]: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. ^verse-6

**7**  What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest [[#^note-7a|were blinded]] ^verse-7

**8**  (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of [[#^note-8a|slumber]], eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not [[#^note-8b|hear]];) unto this day. ^verse-8

**9**  And David saith, Let their table be made a [[#^note-9a|snare]], and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a [[#^note-9b|recompence]] unto them: ^verse-9

**10**  Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. ^verse-10

**11**  I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? [[#^note-11a|God forbid]]: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to [[#^note-11b|jealousy]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the [[#^note-12a|diminishing]] of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? ^verse-12

**13**  For I speak to you [[#^note-13a|Gentiles]], inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I [[#^note-13b|magnify]] mine office: ^verse-13

**14**  If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. ^verse-14

**15**  For if the casting away of them be the [[#^note-15a|reconciling]] of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? ^verse-15

**16**  For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the [[#^note-16a|root]] be holy, so are the branches. ^verse-16

**17**  And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive [[#^note-17a|tree]], wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Boast]] not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. ^verse-19

**20**  Well; because of [[#^note-20a|unbelief]] they were [[#^note-20b|broken]] off, and thou standest by [[#^note-20c|faith]]. Be not highminded, but [[#^note-20d|fear]]: ^verse-20

**21**  For if God spared not the [[#^note-21a|natural]] branches, take heed lest he also [[#^note-21b|spare]] not thee. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. ^verse-22

**23**  And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. ^verse-23

**24**  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? ^verse-24

**25**  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own [[#^note-25a|conceits]]; that [[#^note-25b|blindness]] in part is happened to Israel, until the [[#^note-25c|fulness]] of the [[#^note-25d|Gentiles]] be come in. ^verse-25

**26**  And so all [[#^note-26a|Israel]] shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of [[#^note-26b|Sion]] the [[#^note-26c|Deliverer]], and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: ^verse-26

**27**  For this is my [[#^note-27a|covenant]] unto them, when I shall take away their sins. ^verse-27

**28**  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. ^verse-28

**29**  For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. ^verse-29

**30**  For as ye in times past [[#^note-30a|have not believed]] God, yet have now obtained mercy through their [[#^note-30b|unbelief]]: ^verse-30

**31**  Even so have these also now not [[#^note-31a|believed]], that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. ^verse-31

**32**  For God hath [[#^note-32a|concluded]] them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. ^verse-32

**33**  O the depth of the [[#^note-33a|riches]] both of the [[#^note-33b|wisdom]] and [[#^note-33c|knowledge]] of God! how [[#^note-33d|unsearchable]] are his judgments, and his ways past [[#^note-33e|finding]] out! ^verse-33

**34**  For who hath known the [[#^note-34a|mind]] of the Lord? or who hath been his [[#^note-34b|counsellor]]? ^verse-34

**35**  Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? ^verse-35

**36**  For of him, and [[#^note-36a|through]] him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. ^verse-36
