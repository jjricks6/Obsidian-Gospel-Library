*Abraham's faith was accounted to him for righteousnessâ€”Man is justified by faith, righteous works, and grace.*

**1**  What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|For]] if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [[#^note-2b|whereof to glory]]; but not before God. ^verse-2

**3**  For what saith the scripture? Abraham [[#^note-3a|believed]] God, and it was counted unto him for [[#^note-3b|righteousness]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Now to him that worketh is the [[#^note-4a|reward]] not [[#^note-4b|reckoned]] of grace, but of debt. ^verse-4

**5**  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. ^verse-5

**6**  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, ^verse-6

**7**  Saying, [[#^note-7a|Blessed]] are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. ^verse-7

**8**  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. ^verse-8

**9**  Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. ^verse-9

**10**  How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. ^verse-10

**11**  And he received the [[#^note-11a|sign]] of [[#^note-11b|circumcision]], a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the [[#^note-11c|father]] of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: ^verse-11

**12**  And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also [[#^note-12a|walk]] in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. ^verse-12

**13**  For the promise, that he should be the [[#^note-13a|heir]] of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his [[#^note-13b|seed]], through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. ^verse-13

**14**  For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: ^verse-14

**15**  Because the [[#^note-15a|law]] worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no [[#^note-15b|transgression]]. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Therefore]] it is of faith, that it might be by [[#^note-16b|grace]]; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the [[#^note-16c|faith]] of Abraham; who is the [[#^note-16d|father]] of us all, ^verse-16

**17**  (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who [[#^note-17a|quickeneth]] the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. ^verse-17

**18**  Who against [[#^note-18a|hope]] believed in hope, that he might become the father of many [[#^note-18b|nations]], according to that which was spoken, So shall thy [[#^note-18c|seed]] be. ^verse-18

**19**  And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years [[#^note-19a|old]], neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: ^verse-19

**20**  He [[#^note-20a|staggered]] not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; ^verse-20

**21**  And being fully persuaded that, what he had [[#^note-21a|promised]], he was able also to perform. ^verse-21

**22**  And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. ^verse-22

**23**  Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; ^verse-23

**24**  But for [[#^note-24a|us]] also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; ^verse-24

**25**  Who was delivered for our [[#^note-25a|offences]], and was raised again for our [[#^note-25b|justification]]. ^verse-25
