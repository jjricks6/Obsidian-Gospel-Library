*Paul counsels the Saints to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, to use their own grace-given gifts, and to live as Saints should live.*

**1**  I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your [[#^note-1a|bodies]] a living [[#^note-1b|sacrifice]], holy, [[#^note-1c|acceptable]] unto God, which is your reasonable [[#^note-1d|service]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And be not conformed to this [[#^note-2a|world]]: but be ye [[#^note-2b|transformed]] by the [[#^note-2c|renewing]] of your [[#^note-2d|mind]], that ye may [[#^note-2e|prove]] what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, [[#^note-2f|will]] of God. ^verse-2

**3**  For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to [[#^note-3a|think]] of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think [[#^note-3b|soberly]], according as [[#^note-3c|God]] hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. ^verse-3

**4**  For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same [[#^note-4a|office]]: ^verse-4

**5**  So we, being many, are [[#^note-5a|one]] [[#^note-5b|body]] in Christ, and every one members one of another. ^verse-5

**6**  Having then gifts differing according to the [[#^note-6a|grace]] that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of [[#^note-6b|faith]]; ^verse-6

**7**  Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; ^verse-7

**8**  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with [[#^note-8a|cheerfulness]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Let love be [[#^note-9a|without dissimulation]]. Abhor that which is [[#^note-9b|evil]]; cleave to that which is good. ^verse-9

**10**  Be kindly [[#^note-10a|affectioned]] one to another with [[#^note-10b|brotherly]] [[#^note-10c|love]]; in honour preferring one another; ^verse-10

**11**  Not slothful in [[#^note-11a|business]]; [[#^note-11b|fervent]] in spirit; serving the Lord; ^verse-11

**12**  Rejoicing in hope; [[#^note-12a|patient]] in [[#^note-12b|tribulation]]; [[#^note-12c|continuing instant in]] prayer; ^verse-12

**13**  Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to [[#^note-13a|hospitality]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Bless them which [[#^note-14a|persecute]] you: bless, and [[#^note-14b|curse]] not. ^verse-14

**15**  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and [[#^note-15a|weep]] with them that weep. ^verse-15

**16**  Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but [[#^note-16a|condescend]] to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own [[#^note-16b|conceits]]. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Recompense]] to no man [[#^note-17b|evil]] for evil. Provide things [[#^note-17c|honest]] in the [[#^note-17d|sight]] of all men. ^verse-17

**18**  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live [[#^note-18a|peaceably]] with all men. ^verse-18

**19**  Dearly beloved, [[#^note-19a|avenge]] not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. ^verse-19

**20**  Therefore if thine [[#^note-20a|enemy]] hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. ^verse-20

**21**  Be not [[#^note-21a|overcome]] of evil, but overcome evil with good. ^verse-21
