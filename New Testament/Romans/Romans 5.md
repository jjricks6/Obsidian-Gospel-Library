### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 6|Next Entry]]

*Man is justified through the blood of Christâ€”Adam fell, and Christ atoned that man might be saved.*

**1**  Therefore being [[#^note-1a|justified]] by [[#^note-1b|faith]], we have [[#^note-1c|peace]] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-1

**2**  By whom also we have access by [[#^note-2a|faith]] into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. ^verse-2

**3**  And not only so, but we glory in [[#^note-3a|tribulations]] also: knowing that [[#^note-3b|tribulation]] worketh [[#^note-3c|patience]]; ^verse-3

**4**  And patience, experience; and experience, hope: ^verse-4

**5**  And [[#^note-5a|hope]] maketh not ashamed; because the [[#^note-5b|love]] of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ^verse-5

**6**  For when we were yet without [[#^note-6a|strength]], in due time Christ died for the ungodly. ^verse-6

**7**  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. ^verse-7

**8**  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet [[#^note-8a|sinners]], [[#^note-8b|Christ]] died for us. ^verse-8

**9**  Much more then, being now [[#^note-9a|justified]] by his [[#^note-9b|blood]], we shall be saved from wrath through him. ^verse-9

**10**  For if, when we were enemies, we were [[#^note-10a|reconciled]] to God by the [[#^note-10b|death]] of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. ^verse-10

**11**  And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the [[#^note-11a|atonement]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, as by one man [[#^note-12a|sin]] entered into the world, and [[#^note-12b|death]] by sin; and so [[#^note-12c|death]] passed upon all men, for that all have [[#^note-12d|sinned]]: ^verse-12

**13**  (For until the law [[#^note-13a|sin]] was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no [[#^note-13b|law]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's [[#^note-14a|transgression]], who is the [[#^note-14b|figure]] of him that was to come. ^verse-14

**15**  But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of [[#^note-15a|one]] many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. ^verse-15

**16**  And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. ^verse-16

**17**  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of [[#^note-17a|grace]] and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the [[#^note-18a|righteousness]] of one the free gift came upon all men unto [[#^note-18b|justification]] of life. ^verse-18

**19**  For as by one man's [[#^note-19a|disobedience]] many were made sinners, so by the [[#^note-19b|obedience]] of one shall many be made righteous. ^verse-19

**20**  Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: ^verse-20

**21**  That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through [[#^note-21a|righteousness]] unto [[#^note-21b|eternal life]] by Jesus Christ our Lord. ^verse-21
