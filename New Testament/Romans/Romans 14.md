*Avoid quarreling about opinions and making unrighteous judgment of each other—Every knee will bow to Christ—The kingdom of God embraces righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.*

**1**  Him that is [[#^note-1a|weak]] in the faith receive ye, but not to [[#^note-1b|doubtful]] [[#^note-1c|disputations]]. ^verse-1

**2**  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth [[#^note-2a|herbs]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not [[#^note-3a|judge]] him that eateth: for God hath received him. ^verse-3

**4**  Who art thou that [[#^note-4a|judgest]] another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. ^verse-4

**5**  One man esteemeth one [[#^note-5a|day]] above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. ^verse-5

**6**  He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. ^verse-6

**7**  For none of us [[#^note-7a|liveth]] to himself, and no man dieth to himself. ^verse-7

**8**  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we [[#^note-8a|die]], we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. ^verse-8

**9**  For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be [[#^note-9a|Lord]] both of the [[#^note-9b|dead]] and living. ^verse-9

**10**  But why dost thou [[#^note-10a|judge]] thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the [[#^note-10b|judgment]] seat of Christ. ^verse-10

**11**  For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every [[#^note-11a|knee]] shall bow to me, and every tongue shall [[#^note-11b|confess]] to God. ^verse-11

**12**  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. ^verse-12

**13**  Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a [[#^note-13a|stumblingblock]] or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. ^verse-13

**14**  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing [[#^note-14a|unclean]] of itself: but to him that [[#^note-14b|esteemeth]] any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. ^verse-14

**15**  But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, [[#^note-15a|now]] walkest thou not [[#^note-15b|charitably]]. Destroy not him [[#^note-15c|with thy meat]], for whom Christ died. ^verse-15

**16**  Let not then your good be evil spoken of: ^verse-16

**17**  For the kingdom of God is not [[#^note-17a|meat]] and drink; but [[#^note-17b|righteousness]], and [[#^note-17c|peace]], and [[#^note-17d|joy]] in the Holy Ghost. ^verse-17

**18**  For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. ^verse-18

**19**  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for [[#^note-19a|peace]], and things wherewith one may [[#^note-19b|edify]] another. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|For meat]] destroy not the [[#^note-20b|work]] of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. ^verse-20

**21**  It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is [[#^note-21a|offended]], or is made weak. ^verse-21

**22**  Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself [[#^note-22a|in]] that thing which he alloweth. ^verse-22

**23**  And he that [[#^note-23a|doubteth]] is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of [[#^note-23b|faith]]: for whatsoever is not of faith is [[#^note-23c|sin]]. ^verse-23
