### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Romans|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 2|Next Entry]]

*The gospel is the power of God unto salvation through Jesus Christâ€”The wrath of God rests on those guilty of murder, homosexual practices, fornication, and other sins if the guilty do not repent.*

**1**  Paul, a [[#^note-1a|servant]] of Jesus Christ, called to be an [[#^note-1b|apostle]], [[#^note-1c|separated]] unto the gospel of God, ^verse-1

**2**  (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) ^verse-2

**3**  Concerning his Son [[#^note-3a|Jesus Christ our Lord]], which was made of the [[#^note-3b|seed]] of [[#^note-3c|David]] according to the flesh; ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|declared]] to be the [[#^note-4b|Son of God]] with [[#^note-4c|power]], according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection [[#^note-4d|from the dead]]: ^verse-4

**5**  By whom we have received [[#^note-5a|grace]] and apostleship, [[#^note-5b|for]] [[#^note-5c|obedience]] to the faith among all nations, for his name: ^verse-5

**6**  Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: ^verse-6

**7**  To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be [[#^note-7a|saints]]: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-7

**8**  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your [[#^note-8a|faith]] is [[#^note-8b|spoken of]] throughout the whole world. ^verse-8

**9**  For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; ^verse-9

**10**  Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. ^verse-10

**11**  For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual [[#^note-11a|gift]], to the end ye may be established; ^verse-11

**12**  That is, that I may be [[#^note-12a|comforted]] together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. ^verse-12

**13**  Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was [[#^note-13a|let hitherto]],) that I might have some [[#^note-13b|fruit]] among you also, even as among other Gentiles. ^verse-13

**14**  I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the [[#^note-14a|Barbarians]]; both to the wise, and to the unwise. ^verse-14

**15**  So, as much as in me is, I am [[#^note-15a|ready]] to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. ^verse-15

**16**  For I am not [[#^note-16a|ashamed]] of the [[#^note-16b|gospel]] of Christ: for it is the [[#^note-16c|power]] of God unto [[#^note-16d|salvation]] to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. ^verse-16

**17**  For therein is the [[#^note-17a|righteousness]] of God revealed [[#^note-17b|from]] [[#^note-17c|faith]] to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. ^verse-17

**18**  For the [[#^note-18a|wrath]] of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, [[#^note-18b|who]] [[#^note-18c|hold]] the truth in [[#^note-18d|unrighteousness]]; ^verse-18

**19**  Because that which may be known of God is manifest [[#^note-19a|in]] them; for God hath shewed it unto them. ^verse-19

**20**  For the [[#^note-20a|invisible]] things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his [[#^note-20b|eternal]] [[#^note-20c|power]] and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: ^verse-20

**21**  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were [[#^note-21a|thankful]]; but became [[#^note-21b|vain in their imaginations]], and their [[#^note-21c|foolish]] heart was [[#^note-21d|darkened]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Professing themselves to be [[#^note-22a|wise]], they became fools, ^verse-22

**23**  And changed the glory of the [[#^note-23a|uncorruptible]] God into an [[#^note-23b|image]] made like to [[#^note-23c|corruptible]] man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore God also [[#^note-24a|gave]] them up to [[#^note-24b|uncleanness]] through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: ^verse-24

**25**  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. ^verse-25

**26**  For this cause God [[#^note-26a|gave]] them up unto [[#^note-26b|vile]] [[#^note-26c|affections]]: for even their [[#^note-26d|women]] did change the natural use into that which is against nature: ^verse-26

**27**  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their [[#^note-27a|lust]] one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. ^verse-27

**28**  And even as they did not like to [[#^note-28a|retain]] God in their knowledge, God [[#^note-28b|gave]] them over to a [[#^note-28c|reprobate]] mind, to do those things which are not convenient; ^verse-28

**29**  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, [[#^note-29a|wickedness]], covetousness, [[#^note-29b|maliciousness]]; full of envy, murder, [[#^note-29c|debate]], [[#^note-29d|deceit]], malignity; whisperers, ^verse-29

**30**  [[#^note-30a|Backbiters]], haters of God, [[#^note-30b|despiteful]], [[#^note-30c|proud]], [[#^note-30d|boasters]], inventors of evil things, [[#^note-30e|disobedient]] to parents, ^verse-30

**31**  Without [[#^note-31a|understanding]], covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: ^verse-31

**32**  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of [[#^note-32a|death]], not only do the same, but [[#^note-32b|have]] [[#^note-32c|pleasure]] in them that do them. ^verse-32
