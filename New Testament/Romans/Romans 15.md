### Chapter 15

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 16|Next Entry]]

*True Saints fellowship one another—Paul recounts his diligence in preaching the gospel—The gifts of the Spirit are poured out upon the Gentiles.*

**1**  We then that are strong ought to [[#^note-1a|bear]] the infirmities of the [[#^note-1b|weak]], and not to please ourselves. ^verse-1

**2**  Let every one of us please his [[#^note-2a|neighbour]] for his good to [[#^note-2b|edification]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The [[#^note-3a|reproaches]] of them that reproached thee fell on me. ^verse-3

**4**  For whatsoever things were [[#^note-4a|written]] aforetime were [[#^note-4b|written]] for our [[#^note-4c|learning]], that we through [[#^note-4d|patience]] and comfort of the [[#^note-4e|scriptures]] might have [[#^note-4f|hope]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Now the God of patience and [[#^note-5a|consolation]] grant you to be [[#^note-5b|likeminded]] one toward another according to Christ Jesus: ^verse-5

**6**  That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the [[#^note-6a|Father]] of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. ^verse-7

**8**  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the [[#^note-8a|circumcision]] for the truth of God, to [[#^note-8b|confirm]] the [[#^note-8c|promises]] made unto the fathers: ^verse-8

**9**  And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his [[#^note-9a|mercy]]; as it is written, For this cause I will [[#^note-9b|confess to]] thee among the [[#^note-9c|Gentiles]], and sing unto thy name. ^verse-9

**10**  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye [[#^note-10a|Gentiles]], with his people. ^verse-10

**11**  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. ^verse-11

**12**  And again, [[#^note-12a|Esaias]] saith, There shall be a root of [[#^note-12b|Jesse]], and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. ^verse-12

**13**  Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and [[#^note-13a|peace]] in believing, that ye may abound in [[#^note-13b|hope]], through the power of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-13

**14**  And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all [[#^note-14a|knowledge]], able also to [[#^note-14b|admonish]] one another. ^verse-14

**15**  Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in [[#^note-15a|some sort]], as putting you in mind, because of the [[#^note-15b|grace]] that is given to me of God, ^verse-15

**16**  That I should be the [[#^note-16a|minister]] of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the [[#^note-16b|offering up]] of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being [[#^note-16c|sanctified]] by the Holy Ghost. ^verse-16

**17**  I have therefore whereof I may [[#^note-17a|glory]] through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. ^verse-17

**18**  For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, ^verse-18

**19**  Through mighty [[#^note-19a|signs]] and wonders, by the power of the [[#^note-19b|Spirit]] of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. ^verse-19

**20**  Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's [[#^note-20a|foundation]]: ^verse-20

**21**  But as it is written, To whom he was not [[#^note-21a|spoken]] of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand. ^verse-21

**22**  For which cause also I have been much [[#^note-22a|hindered]] from coming to you. ^verse-22

**23**  But now having no more [[#^note-23a|place]] in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; ^verse-23

**24**  Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. ^verse-24

**25**  But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. ^verse-25

**26**  For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain [[#^note-26a|contribution]] for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. ^verse-26

**27**  It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their [[#^note-27a|spiritual]] things, their [[#^note-27b|duty]] is also to minister unto them in [[#^note-27c|carnal]] things. ^verse-27

**28**  When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this [[#^note-28a|fruit]], I will come by you into Spain. ^verse-28

**29**  And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the [[#^note-29a|fulness]] of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. ^verse-29

**30**  Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; ^verse-30

**31**  That I may be delivered from them that [[#^note-31a|do not believe]] in Judæa; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; ^verse-31

**32**  That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be [[#^note-32a|refreshed]]. ^verse-32

**33**  Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. ^verse-33
