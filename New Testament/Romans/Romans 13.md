*Paul counsels, Be subject unto God's ministers; keep the commandments; love one another; righteousness leads to salvation.*

**1**  Let every soul [[#^note-1a|be subject]] unto the higher [[#^note-1b|powers]]. For there is no [[#^note-1c|power]] [[#^note-1d|but of God]]: the [[#^note-1e|powers]] that be are ordained of God. ^verse-1

**2**  Whosoever therefore [[#^note-2a|resist]]eth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves [[#^note-2b|damnation]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the [[#^note-3a|power]]? do that which is [[#^note-3b|good]], and thou shalt have praise of the same: ^verse-3

**4**  For he is [[#^note-4a|the minister]] of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for [[#^note-5a|conscience]] sake. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|For]] for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. ^verse-6

**7**  Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; [[#^note-7a|honour]] to whom honour. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Owe]] no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that [[#^note-8b|loveth]] another hath fulfilled the law. ^verse-8

**9**  For this, Thou shalt not commit [[#^note-9a|adultery]], Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not [[#^note-9b|steal]], Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not [[#^note-9c|covet]]; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy [[#^note-9d|neighbour]] as thyself. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Love]] worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the [[#^note-10b|law]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And that, knowing the [[#^note-11a|time]], that now it is high time to awake out of [[#^note-11b|sleep]]: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. ^verse-11

**12**  The night is far spent, the [[#^note-12a|day]] is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of [[#^note-12b|darkness]], and let us put on the [[#^note-12c|armour]] of [[#^note-12d|light]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Let us walk [[#^note-13a|honestly]], as in the day; not in [[#^note-13b|rioting]] and [[#^note-13c|drunkenness]], not in [[#^note-13d|chambering]] and wantonness, not in strife and [[#^note-13e|envying]]. ^verse-13

**14**  But [[#^note-14a|put]] ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the [[#^note-14b|lusts]] thereof. ^verse-14
