*The law of Moses is fulfilled in Christâ€”Paul delights in the law of God after the inward man.*

**1**  Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the [[#^note-1a|law]],) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? ^verse-1

**2**  For the [[#^note-2a|woman]] which hath an [[#^note-2b|husband]] is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. ^verse-2

**3**  So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become [[#^note-4a|dead]] to the [[#^note-4b|law]] by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|For]] when we were in the flesh, the [[#^note-5b|motions of sins]], which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto [[#^note-5c|death]]. ^verse-5

**6**  But now we are [[#^note-6a|delivered from]] the law, that being [[#^note-6b|dead]] wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of [[#^note-6c|spirit]], and not in the oldness of the letter. ^verse-6

**7**  What shall we say then? Is the law sin? [[#^note-7a|God forbid]]. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the [[#^note-7b|law]]: for I had not known [[#^note-7c|lust]], except the law had said, Thou shalt not [[#^note-7d|covet]]. ^verse-7

**8**  But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the [[#^note-8a|law]] sin was dead. ^verse-8

**9**  For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. ^verse-9

**10**  And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto [[#^note-10a|death]]. ^verse-10

**11**  For sin, [[#^note-11a|taking occasion]] by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. ^verse-12

**13**  Was then that which is good made death unto me? [[#^note-13a|God forbid]]. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. ^verse-13

**14**  For we know that the [[#^note-14a|law]] is spiritual: but I am [[#^note-14b|carnal]], [[#^note-14c|sold under]] sin. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|For]] [[#^note-15b|that which I do]] I [[#^note-15c|allow]] not: for what I [[#^note-15d|would]], that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. ^verse-15

**16**  If then I do that which I [[#^note-16a|would]] not, I consent unto the law that it is good. ^verse-16

**17**  Now then it is no more I that [[#^note-17a|do]] it, but sin that dwelleth in me. ^verse-17

**18**  For I know that in me (that is, in my [[#^note-18a|flesh]],) [[#^note-18b|dwelleth]] no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to [[#^note-18c|perform]] that which is good I find not. ^verse-18

**19**  For the [[#^note-19a|good]] that I [[#^note-19b|would]] I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. ^verse-19

**20**  Now if I do [[#^note-20a|that I would not]], it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. ^verse-20

**21**  I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is [[#^note-21a|present]] with me. ^verse-21

**22**  For I [[#^note-22a|delight]] in the law of God after the inward man: ^verse-22

**23**  But I see another law in my members, [[#^note-23a|warring]] against the law of my mind, and bringing me into [[#^note-23b|captivity]] to the law of sin which is in my members. ^verse-23

**24**  O [[#^note-24a|wretched]] man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? ^verse-24

**25**  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. ^verse-25
