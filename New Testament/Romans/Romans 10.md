### Chapter 10

[[New Testament/Romans/Romans 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans/Romans 11|Next Entry]]

*Salvation comes through righteousness to those who believe in Christâ€”Faith comes by hearing the gospel taught by legal administrators sent of God.*

**1**  Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be [[#^note-1a|saved]]. ^verse-1

**2**  For I bear them record that they have a [[#^note-2a|zeal]] of God, but not according to knowledge. ^verse-2

**3**  For they being ignorant of God's [[#^note-3a|righteousness]], and [[#^note-3b|going about]] to establish their own righteousness, have not [[#^note-3c|submitted]] themselves unto the righteousness of God. ^verse-3

**4**  For Christ is the [[#^note-4a|end]] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. ^verse-4

**5**  For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. ^verse-5

**6**  But the [[#^note-6a|righteousness]] which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) ^verse-6

**7**  Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) ^verse-7

**8**  But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; ^verse-8

**9**  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. ^verse-9

**10**  For with the [[#^note-10a|heart]] man [[#^note-10b|believeth]] unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto [[#^note-10c|salvation]]. ^verse-10

**11**  For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. ^verse-11

**12**  For there is no [[#^note-12a|difference]] between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is [[#^note-12b|rich]] unto all that [[#^note-12c|call]] upon him. ^verse-12

**13**  For whosoever shall [[#^note-13a|call]] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ^verse-13

**14**  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not [[#^note-14a|believed]]? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a [[#^note-14b|preacher]]? ^verse-14

**15**  And how shall they [[#^note-15a|preach]], except they be [[#^note-15b|sent]]? as it is written, How beautiful are the [[#^note-15c|feet]] of them that preach the [[#^note-15d|gospel]] of [[#^note-15e|peace]], and bring glad tidings of good things! ^verse-15

**16**  But they have not all [[#^note-16a|obeyed]] the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath [[#^note-16b|believed]] our report? ^verse-16

**17**  So then [[#^note-17a|faith]] cometh by [[#^note-17b|hearing]], and hearing by the word of God. ^verse-17

**18**  But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their [[#^note-18a|words]] unto the ends of the [[#^note-18b|world]]. ^verse-18

**19**  But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to [[#^note-19a|jealousy]] by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. ^verse-19

**20**  But [[#^note-20a|Esaias]] is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that [[#^note-20b|sought]] me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. ^verse-20

**21**  But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a [[#^note-21a|disobedient]] and [[#^note-21b|gainsaying]] people. ^verse-21
