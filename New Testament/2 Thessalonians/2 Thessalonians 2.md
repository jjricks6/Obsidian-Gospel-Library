[[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 3|Next Entry]]

*Apostasy is to precede the Second Comingâ€”The gospel prepares men for eternal glory.*

**1**  Now we beseech you, brethren, [[#^note-1a|by]] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, ^verse-1

**2**  That ye be not soon shaken in mind, [[#^note-2a|or]] be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by [[#^note-2b|letter]] as from us, as that the [[#^note-2c|day]] of Christ is at hand. ^verse-2

**3**  Let no man deceive you by any means: [[#^note-3a|for]] that day shall not come, except there come a [[#^note-3b|falling away]] first, and that [[#^note-3c|man]] of [[#^note-3d|sin]] be revealed, the son of perdition; ^verse-3

**4**  Who [[#^note-4a|opposeth]] and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. ^verse-4

**5**  Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? ^verse-5

**6**  And now ye know [[#^note-6a|what withholdeth]] that he might be [[#^note-6b|revealed]] in his time. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|For]] the [[#^note-7b|mystery]] of [[#^note-7c|iniquity]] doth already work: only [[#^note-7d|he]] who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. ^verse-7

**8**  And then shall that [[#^note-8a|Wicked]] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his [[#^note-8b|coming]]: ^verse-8

**9**  Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all [[#^note-9a|power]] and [[#^note-9b|signs]] and lying wonders, ^verse-9

**10**  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. ^verse-10

**11**  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: ^verse-11

**12**  That they all might be [[#^note-12a|damned]] who [[#^note-12b|believed not]] the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. ^verse-12

**13**  But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning [[#^note-13a|chosen]] you to salvation through [[#^note-13b|sanctification]] of the Spirit and belief of the truth: ^verse-13

**14**  Whereunto he called you by our [[#^note-14a|gospel]], to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. ^verse-15

**16**  Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath [[#^note-16a|loved]] us, and hath given us everlasting [[#^note-16b|consolation]] and good hope through [[#^note-16c|grace]], ^verse-16

**17**  Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. ^verse-17
