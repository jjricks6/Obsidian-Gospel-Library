### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Timothy|Next Entry]]

*Pray for the triumph of the gospel cause—Paul preaches the gospel of work—Be not weary in well-doing.*

**1**  Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord [[#^note-1a|may have free course]], and be glorified, even as it is with you: ^verse-1

**2**  And that we may be delivered from [[#^note-2a|unreasonable]] and wicked men: for all men have not faith. ^verse-2

**3**  But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from [[#^note-3a|evil]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And we have [[#^note-4a|confidence]] in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord [[#^note-5a|direct]] your hearts into the [[#^note-5b|love]] of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye [[#^note-6a|withdraw]] yourselves from every brother that walketh [[#^note-6b|disorderly]], and not after the tradition which he received of us. ^verse-6

**7**  For yourselves know how ye ought to [[#^note-7a|follow]] us: for we [[#^note-7b|behaved]] not ourselves disorderly among you; ^verse-7

**8**  Neither did we eat any man's bread [[#^note-8a|for nought]]; but wrought with [[#^note-8b|labour]] and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: ^verse-8

**9**  Not because we have not [[#^note-9a|power]], but to make ourselves an [[#^note-9b|ensample]] unto you to follow us. ^verse-9

**10**  For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not [[#^note-10a|work]], neither should he eat. ^verse-10

**11**  For we hear that there are some which walk among you [[#^note-11a|disorderly]], working not at all, but are busybodies. ^verse-11

**12**  Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own [[#^note-12a|bread]]. ^verse-12

**13**  But ye, brethren, be not [[#^note-13a|weary]] in well doing. ^verse-13

**14**  And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. ^verse-14

**15**  Yet count him not as an [[#^note-15a|enemy]], but [[#^note-15b|admonish]] him as a [[#^note-15c|brother]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. ^verse-16

**17**  The salutation of Paul with mine own [[#^note-17a|hand]], which is the token in every epistle: so I write. ^verse-17

**18**  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. ^verse-18
