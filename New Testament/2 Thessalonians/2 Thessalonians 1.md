[[New Testament/2 Thessalonians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians/2 Thessalonians 2|Next Entry]]

*At His Second Coming, the Lord Jesus will take vengeance upon the ungodly.*

**1**  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, [[#^note-1a|unto]] the [[#^note-1b|church]] of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-1

**2**  Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; ^verse-3

**4**  So that we ourselves glory in you in the [[#^note-4a|churches]] of God for your [[#^note-4b|patience]] and faith in all your [[#^note-4c|persecutions]] and tribulations that ye endure: ^verse-4

**5**  Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also [[#^note-5a|suffer]]: ^verse-5

**6**  Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; ^verse-6

**7**  And to you who are troubled [[#^note-7a|rest]] with us, when the [[#^note-7b|Lord]] Jesus shall be [[#^note-7c|revealed]] from heaven with his mighty [[#^note-7d|angels]], ^verse-7

**8**  In flaming [[#^note-8a|fire]] taking [[#^note-8b|vengeance]] on them that know not God, and that [[#^note-8c|obey not]] the [[#^note-8d|gospel]] of our Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-8

**9**  Who shall be [[#^note-9a|punished]] with [[#^note-9b|everlasting]] [[#^note-9c|destruction]] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; ^verse-9

**10**  When he shall come to be [[#^note-10a|glorified]] in his [[#^note-10b|saints]], and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you [[#^note-11a|worthy]] of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: ^verse-11

**12**  That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the [[#^note-12a|grace]] of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-12
