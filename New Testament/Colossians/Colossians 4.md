[[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians|Next Entry]]

*The Saints are told to be wise in all thingsâ€”Luke and others greet the Colossians.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Masters]], give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a [[#^note-1b|Master]] in [[#^note-1c|heaven]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; ^verse-2

**3**  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a [[#^note-3a|door]] of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: ^verse-3

**4**  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Walk]] in [[#^note-5b|wisdom]] toward them that are without, redeeming the time. ^verse-5

**6**  Let your [[#^note-6a|speech]] be alway with grace, seasoned with [[#^note-6b|salt]], that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. ^verse-6

**7**  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: ^verse-7

**8**  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; ^verse-8

**9**  With [[#^note-9a|Onesimus]], a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Aristarchus]] my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and [[#^note-10b|Marcus]], [[#^note-10c|sister's son]] to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) ^verse-10

**11**  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the [[#^note-11a|circumcision]]. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Epaphras]], who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. ^verse-12

**13**  For I bear him record, that he hath a great [[#^note-13a|zeal]] for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. ^verse-13

**14**  Luke, the beloved physician, and [[#^note-14a|Demas]], greet you. ^verse-14

**15**  Salute the brethren which are in [[#^note-15a|Laodicea]], and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. ^verse-15

**16**  And when this [[#^note-16a|epistle]] is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. ^verse-16

**17**  And say to [[#^note-17a|Archippus]], Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. ^verse-17

**18**  The salutation by the [[#^note-18a|hand]] of me Paul. Remember my [[#^note-18b|bonds]]. Grace be with you. Amen. ^verse-18
