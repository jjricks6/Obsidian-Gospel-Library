### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Colossians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 2|Next Entry]]

*Redemption comes through Christâ€”He created all things, is in the image of God, and is the Firstborn of the Father.*

**1**  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, ^verse-1

**2**  To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, ^verse-3

**4**  Since we heard of your [[#^note-4a|faith]] in Christ Jesus, and of the [[#^note-4b|love]] which ye have to all the saints, ^verse-4

**5**  For the [[#^note-5a|hope]] which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the [[#^note-5b|gospel]]; ^verse-5

**6**  Which is come unto you, [[#^note-6a|as]] it is in all the world; and bringeth forth [[#^note-6b|fruit]], as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the [[#^note-6c|grace]] of God in truth: ^verse-6

**7**  As ye also learned of [[#^note-7a|Epaphras]] our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; ^verse-7

**8**  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. ^verse-8

**9**  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the [[#^note-9a|knowledge]] of his [[#^note-9b|will]] in all wisdom and spiritual [[#^note-9c|understanding]]; ^verse-9

**10**  That ye might [[#^note-10a|walk]] [[#^note-10b|worthy]] of the Lord unto all [[#^note-10c|pleasing]], being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the [[#^note-10d|knowledge]] of God; ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Strengthened]] with all might, according to his [[#^note-11b|glorious]] [[#^note-11c|power]], unto all patience and longsuffering with [[#^note-11d|joyfulness]]; ^verse-11

**12**  Giving [[#^note-12a|thanks]] unto the Father, which hath [[#^note-12b|made us meet]] to be partakers of the [[#^note-12c|inheritance]] of the saints in light: ^verse-12

**13**  Who hath delivered us from the power of [[#^note-13a|darkness]], and hath translated us into the [[#^note-13b|kingdom]] of his dear [[#^note-13c|Son]]: ^verse-13

**14**  In whom we have [[#^note-14a|redemption]] through his blood, even the [[#^note-14b|forgiveness]] of sins: ^verse-14

**15**  Who is the [[#^note-15a|image]] of the invisible [[#^note-15b|God]], the [[#^note-15c|firstborn]] of [[#^note-15d|every creature]]: ^verse-15

**16**  For by him were all [[#^note-16a|things]] [[#^note-16b|created]], that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or [[#^note-16c|principalities]], or powers: all things were [[#^note-16d|created]] by him, and for him: ^verse-16

**17**  And he is before all things, and by him all things [[#^note-17a|consist]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And he is the [[#^note-18a|head]] of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the [[#^note-18b|firstborn]] from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. ^verse-18

**19**  For it pleased the Father that in him should all [[#^note-19a|fulness]] dwell; ^verse-19

**20**  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to [[#^note-20a|reconcile]] all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. ^verse-20

**21**  And you, that were [[#^note-21a|sometime]] [[#^note-21b|alienated]] and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled ^verse-21

**22**  In the body of his flesh through [[#^note-22a|death]], to present you holy and [[#^note-22b|unblameable]] and unreproveable in his sight: ^verse-22

**23**  If ye [[#^note-23a|continue]] in the faith [[#^note-23b|grounded and settled]], and be not [[#^note-23c|moved]] away from the [[#^note-23d|hope]] of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; ^verse-23

**24**  Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the [[#^note-24a|afflictions]] of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: ^verse-24

**25**  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the [[#^note-25a|dispensation]] of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; ^verse-25

**26**  Even the [[#^note-26a|mystery]] which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made [[#^note-26b|manifest]] to his saints: ^verse-26

**27**  To whom God would make [[#^note-27a|known]] what is the [[#^note-27b|riches]] of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: ^verse-27

**28**  Whom we [[#^note-28a|preach]], [[#^note-28b|warning]] every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: ^verse-28

**29**  Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. ^verse-29
