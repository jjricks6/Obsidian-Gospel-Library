### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 3|Next Entry]]

*The fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ—Beware of being deceived by the traditions of men—The handwriting against us was nailed to the cross of Christ.*

**1**  For I would that ye knew what great [[#^note-1a|conflict]] I have for you, and for them at [[#^note-1b|Laodicea]], and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; ^verse-1

**2**  That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of [[#^note-2a|understanding]], to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, [[#^note-2b|and]] of the Father, and of Christ; ^verse-2

**3**  In whom are hid all the [[#^note-3a|treasures]] of [[#^note-3b|wisdom]] and [[#^note-3c|knowledge]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. ^verse-4

**5**  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your [[#^note-5a|order]], and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so [[#^note-6a|walk]] ye in him: ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Rooted]] and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with [[#^note-7b|thanksgiving]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Beware lest any man [[#^note-8a|spoil]] you through [[#^note-8b|philosophy]] and vain [[#^note-8c|deceit]], after the [[#^note-8d|tradition]] of men, after the rudiments of the [[#^note-8e|world]], and not after Christ. ^verse-8

**9**  For in him dwelleth all the [[#^note-9a|fulness]] of the Godhead bodily. ^verse-9

**10**  And ye are [[#^note-10a|complete]] in him, which is the head of all [[#^note-10b|principality]] and power: ^verse-10

**11**  In whom also ye are circumcised with the [[#^note-11a|circumcision]] made without hands, in putting off the [[#^note-11b|body]] of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Buried]] with him in [[#^note-12b|baptism]], wherein also ye are [[#^note-12c|risen]] with him through the faith of the [[#^note-12d|operation]] of God, who hath raised him from the dead. ^verse-12

**13**  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he [[#^note-13a|quickened together]] with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Blotting]] out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; ^verse-14

**15**  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. ^verse-15

**16**  Let no man therefore [[#^note-16a|judge]] you in [[#^note-16b|meat]], or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the [[#^note-16c|sabbath]] days: ^verse-16

**17**  Which are a [[#^note-17a|shadow]] of things to come; but the body is of Christ. ^verse-17

**18**  Let no man [[#^note-18a|beguile]] you of your reward in a voluntary [[#^note-18b|humility]] and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, ^verse-18

**19**  And not holding the [[#^note-19a|Head]], from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore if ye be [[#^note-20a|dead]] with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to [[#^note-20b|ordinances]], ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|(Touch]] not; taste not; handle not; ^verse-21

**22**  Which all are to perish with the using;) after the [[#^note-22a|commandments]] and [[#^note-22b|doctrines]] of men? ^verse-22

**23**  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh. ^verse-23
