[[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Colossians/Colossians 4|Next Entry]]

*Some lives are hidden with God in Christâ€”The Saints are told to be holy and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.*

**1**  If ye then be [[#^note-1a|risen]] with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. ^verse-1

**2**  Set your [[#^note-2a|affection]] on [[#^note-2b|things]] [[#^note-2c|above]], not on things on the [[#^note-2d|earth]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For ye are [[#^note-3a|dead]], and your life is hid with Christ in God. ^verse-3

**4**  When Christ, who is our [[#^note-4a|life]], shall [[#^note-4b|appear]], then shall ye also appear with him in [[#^note-4c|glory]]. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Mortify]] therefore your [[#^note-5b|members]] which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, [[#^note-5c|inordinate affection]], evil concupiscence, and [[#^note-5d|covetousness]], which is [[#^note-5e|idolatry]]: ^verse-5

**6**  For which things' sake the [[#^note-6a|wrath]] of God cometh on the children of [[#^note-6b|disobedience]]: ^verse-6

**7**  In the which ye also walked [[#^note-7a|some time]], when ye lived in them. ^verse-7

**8**  But now ye also [[#^note-8a|put]] off all these; [[#^note-8b|anger]], wrath, [[#^note-8c|malice]], [[#^note-8d|blasphemy]], filthy [[#^note-8e|communication]] out of your mouth. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Lie]] not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the [[#^note-9b|old]] man with his deeds; ^verse-9

**10**  And have put on the [[#^note-10a|new man]], which is renewed in knowledge after the [[#^note-10b|image]] of him that [[#^note-10c|created]] him: ^verse-10

**11**  Where there is neither [[#^note-11a|Greek]] nor Jew, [[#^note-11b|circumcision]] nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. ^verse-11

**12**  Put on therefore, as the [[#^note-12a|elect]] of God, holy and beloved, [[#^note-12b|bowels]] of [[#^note-12c|mercies]], [[#^note-12d|kindness]], [[#^note-12e|humbleness]] of mind, [[#^note-12f|meekness]], longsuffering; ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Forbearing]] one another, and [[#^note-13b|forgiving]] one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. ^verse-13

**14**  And above all these things put on [[#^note-14a|charity]], which is the bond of perfectness. ^verse-14

**15**  And let the [[#^note-15a|peace]] of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye [[#^note-15b|thankful]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Let the [[#^note-16a|word]] of Christ dwell in you richly in all [[#^note-16b|wisdom]]; [[#^note-16c|teaching]] and admonishing one another in psalms and [[#^note-16d|hymns]] and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  And whatsoever ye [[#^note-17a|do]] in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving [[#^note-17b|thanks]] to God and the Father by him. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Wives]], submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Husbands]], [[#^note-19b|love]] your wives, and be not bitter against them. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Children]], [[#^note-20b|obey]] your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Fathers]], [[#^note-21b|provoke]] not your children to [[#^note-21c|anger]], lest they be discouraged. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Servants]], obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in [[#^note-22b|singleness]] of heart, [[#^note-22c|fearing]] God: ^verse-22

**23**  And whatsoever ye do, do it [[#^note-23a|heartily]], as to the Lord, and not unto men; ^verse-23

**24**  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall [[#^note-24a|receive]] the [[#^note-24b|reward]] of the [[#^note-24c|inheritance]]: for ye [[#^note-24d|serve]] the Lord Christ. ^verse-24

**25**  But he that doeth [[#^note-25a|wrong]] shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no [[#^note-25b|respect]] of persons. ^verse-25
