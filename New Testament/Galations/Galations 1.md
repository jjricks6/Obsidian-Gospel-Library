# The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Galations|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2|Next Entry]]

*Preachers of false gospels are accursed—Paul received the gospel by revelation—He believed, was taught, and preached to the Gentiles.*

**1**  Paul, an [[#^note-1a|apostle]], (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) ^verse-1

**2**  And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: ^verse-2

**3**  Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, ^verse-3

**4**  Who [[#^note-4a|gave]] himself for our sins, that he might [[#^note-4b|deliver]] us from this present evil world, according to the [[#^note-4c|will]] of God and our Father: ^verse-4

**5**  To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-5

**6**  I marvel that ye are so soon [[#^note-6a|removed]] from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another [[#^note-6b|gospel]]: ^verse-6

**7**  Which is not another; but there be some that [[#^note-7a|trouble]] you, and would [[#^note-7b|pervert]] the [[#^note-7c|gospel]] of Christ. ^verse-7

**8**  But though we, or an [[#^note-8a|angel]] from heaven, preach any [[#^note-8b|other]] [[#^note-8c|gospel]] unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be [[#^note-8d|accursed]]. ^verse-8

**9**  As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other [[#^note-9a|gospel]] unto you than that ye have received, let him be [[#^note-9b|accursed]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For do I now [[#^note-10a|persuade]] men, or God? or do I seek to [[#^note-10b|please]] men? for if I yet [[#^note-10c|pleased]] men, I should not be the servant of Christ. ^verse-10

**11**  But I [[#^note-11a|certify]] you, brethren, that the gospel which was [[#^note-11b|preached]] of me is not after man. ^verse-11

**12**  For I neither received it [[#^note-12a|of man]], neither was I taught it, but [[#^note-12b|by]] the [[#^note-12c|revelation]] of Jesus Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  For ye have heard of my [[#^note-13a|conversation]] in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I [[#^note-13b|persecuted]] the church of God, and [[#^note-13c|wasted]] it: ^verse-13

**14**  And [[#^note-14a|profited]] in the Jews' religion above many [[#^note-14b|my equals]] in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[#^note-14c|zealous]] of the [[#^note-14d|traditions]] of my fathers. ^verse-14

**15**  But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his [[#^note-15a|grace]], ^verse-15

**16**  To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the [[#^note-16a|heathen]]; immediately I conferred not with [[#^note-16b|flesh and blood]]: ^verse-16

**17**  Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. ^verse-17

**18**  Then after three years I went up to [[#^note-18a|Jerusalem]] to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. ^verse-18

**19**  But other of the [[#^note-19a|apostles]] saw I none, save [[#^note-19b|James]] the Lord's [[#^note-19c|brother]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Now the things which I [[#^note-20a|write]] unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. ^verse-20

**21**  Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; ^verse-21

**22**  And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ: ^verse-22

**23**  But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. ^verse-23

**24**  And they glorified God in me. ^verse-24
