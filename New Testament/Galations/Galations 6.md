### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/Galations/Galations 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Ephesians|Next Entry]]

*Bear one another's burdens—As you sow, so shall you reap—Be not weary in well-doing.*

**1**  Brethren, if a man be [[#^note-1a|overtaken]] in a [[#^note-1b|fault]], ye which are spiritual, [[#^note-1c|restore]] such an one in the spirit of meekness; [[#^note-1d|considering]] thyself, lest thou also be tempted. ^verse-1

**2**  Bear ye one another's [[#^note-2a|burdens]], and so fulfil the law of Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. ^verse-3

**4**  But let every man [[#^note-4a|prove]] his own [[#^note-4b|work]], and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. ^verse-4

**5**  For every man shall [[#^note-5a|bear]] his own burden. ^verse-5

**6**  Let him that is taught in the word [[#^note-6a|communicate]] unto him that teacheth in all good things. ^verse-6

**7**  Be not [[#^note-7a|deceived]]; God is not [[#^note-7b|mocked]]: for whatsoever a man [[#^note-7c|soweth]], that shall he also [[#^note-7d|reap]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. ^verse-8

**9**  And let us not be [[#^note-9a|weary]] in well doing: for in due season we shall [[#^note-9b|reap]], if we faint not. ^verse-9

**10**  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do [[#^note-10a|good]] unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. ^verse-10

**11**  Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. ^verse-11

**12**  As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer [[#^note-12a|persecution]] for the cross of Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. ^verse-13

**14**  But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. ^verse-14

**15**  For in Christ Jesus neither [[#^note-15a|circumcision]] availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. ^verse-15

**16**  And as many as walk according to this rule, [[#^note-16a|peace]] be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. ^verse-16

**17**  From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-17

**18**  Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ^verse-18
