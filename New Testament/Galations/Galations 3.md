### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/Galations/Galations 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4|Next Entry]]

*God gave the gospel to Abraham—The Mosaic law was added because of transgressions—The law was a schoolmaster until Christ—The Saints are children of God by faith—All who are of the faith and baptized into Christ become Abraham's seed.*

**1**  O foolish Galatians, who hath [[#^note-1a|bewitched]] you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? ^verse-1

**2**  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the [[#^note-2a|law]], or by the [[#^note-2b|hearing]] of faith? ^verse-2

**3**  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? ^verse-3

**4**  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. ^verse-4

**5**  He therefore that [[#^note-5a|ministereth]] to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? ^verse-5

**6**  Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for [[#^note-6a|righteousness]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the [[#^note-7a|children of Abraham]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the [[#^note-8a|heathen]] through faith, preached before the [[#^note-8b|gospel]] unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all [[#^note-8c|nations]] be [[#^note-8d|blessed]]. ^verse-8

**9**  So then they which be of faith are [[#^note-9a|blessed]] with faithful Abraham. ^verse-9

**10**  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, [[#^note-10a|Cursed]] is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. ^verse-10

**11**  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by [[#^note-11a|faith]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. ^verse-12

**13**  Christ hath [[#^note-13a|redeemed]] us from the [[#^note-13b|curse]] of the [[#^note-13c|law]], being made a curse for us: for it is written, [[#^note-13d|Cursed]] is every one that hangeth on a tree: ^verse-13

**14**  That the [[#^note-14a|blessing]] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through [[#^note-14b|Jesus Christ]]; that we might receive the [[#^note-14c|promise]] of the Spirit through faith. ^verse-14

**15**  Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. ^verse-15

**16**  Now to [[#^note-16a|Abraham]] and his seed were the [[#^note-16b|promises]] made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. ^verse-16

**17**  And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was [[#^note-17a|four hundred and thirty]] years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. ^verse-17

**18**  For if the [[#^note-18a|inheritance]] be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Wherefore]] then serveth the law? It was [[#^note-19b|added]] because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. ^verse-19

**20**  Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. ^verse-20

**21**  Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. ^verse-21

**22**  But the scripture hath concluded all under [[#^note-22a|sin]], that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. ^verse-22

**23**  But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore the [[#^note-24a|law]] was our [[#^note-24b|schoolmaster]] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be [[#^note-24c|justified]] by faith. ^verse-24

**25**  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. ^verse-25

**26**  For ye are all the [[#^note-26a|children]] of God by [[#^note-26b|faith]] in Christ Jesus. ^verse-26

**27**  For as many of you as have been [[#^note-27a|baptized]] into Christ have put on Christ. ^verse-27

**28**  There is neither Jew nor [[#^note-28a|Greek]], there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all [[#^note-28b|one]] in Christ Jesus. ^verse-28

**29**  And if ye be Christ's, then are ye [[#^note-29a|Abraham's]] [[#^note-29b|seed]], and [[#^note-29c|heirs]] according to the promise. ^verse-29
