[[New Testament/Galations/Galations 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Galations/Galations 6|Next Entry]]

*Stand fast in gospel liberty—Seek faith, love, Christ, and the Spirit—The works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit are named.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Stand]] fast therefore in the [[#^note-1b|liberty]] wherewith Christ hath made us [[#^note-1c|free]], and be not [[#^note-1d|entangled]] again with the yoke of [[#^note-1e|bondage]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. ^verse-2

**3**  For I testify again to every man that is [[#^note-3a|circumcised]], that he is a debtor to do the whole law. ^verse-3

**4**  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the [[#^note-4a|law]]; ye are fallen from [[#^note-4b|grace]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by [[#^note-5a|faith]]. ^verse-5

**6**  For in Jesus Christ neither [[#^note-6a|circumcision]] [[#^note-6b|availeth any thing]], nor uncircumcision; but [[#^note-6c|faith]] which worketh by [[#^note-6d|love]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not [[#^note-7a|obey]] the truth? ^verse-7

**8**  This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. ^verse-8

**9**  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. ^verse-9

**10**  I have [[#^note-10a|confidence]] in you through the Lord, that ye [[#^note-10b|will be]] none otherwise minded: but he that [[#^note-10c|troubleth]] you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. ^verse-10

**11**  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the [[#^note-11a|offence]] of the cross ceased. ^verse-11

**12**  I would they were even [[#^note-12a|cut off]] which [[#^note-12b|trouble]] you. ^verse-12

**13**  For, brethren, ye have been called unto [[#^note-13a|liberty]]; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love [[#^note-13b|serve]] one another. ^verse-13

**14**  For all the [[#^note-14a|law]] is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt [[#^note-14b|love]] thy neighbour as thyself. ^verse-14

**15**  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. ^verse-15

**16**  This I say then, [[#^note-16a|Walk]] in the [[#^note-16b|Spirit]], and ye shall not fulfil the [[#^note-16c|lust]] of the flesh. ^verse-16

**17**  For the flesh lusteth against the [[#^note-17a|Spirit]], and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ^verse-17

**18**  But if ye be [[#^note-18a|led]] of the Spirit, ye are not under the [[#^note-18b|law]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Now the works of the [[#^note-19a|flesh]] are manifest, which are these; Adultery, [[#^note-19b|fornication]], [[#^note-19c|uncleanness]], lasciviousness, ^verse-19

**20**  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, [[#^note-20a|strife]], seditions, heresies, ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Envyings]], murders, [[#^note-21b|drunkenness]], [[#^note-21c|revellings]], and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. ^verse-21

**22**  But the [[#^note-22a|fruit]] of the [[#^note-22b|Spirit]] is [[#^note-22c|love]], [[#^note-22d|joy]], [[#^note-22e|peace]], [[#^note-22f|longsuffering]], [[#^note-22g|gentleness]], goodness, [[#^note-22h|faith]], ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|Meekness]], [[#^note-23b|temperance]]: against such there is no law. ^verse-23

**24**  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the [[#^note-24a|affections]] and lusts. ^verse-24

**25**  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. ^verse-25

**26**  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, [[#^note-26a|provoking]] one another, envying one another. ^verse-26
