*Paul goes to Jerusalem—He contends for the true gospel—Salvation comes through Christ.*

**1**  Then fourteen years after I went up again to [[#^note-1a|Jerusalem]] with [[#^note-1b|Barnabas]], and took Titus with me also. ^verse-1

**2**  And I went up by [[#^note-2a|revelation]], and [[#^note-2b|communicated]] unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. ^verse-2

**3**  But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be [[#^note-3a|circumcised]]: ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|And]] that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our [[#^note-4b|liberty]] which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into [[#^note-4c|bondage]]: ^verse-4

**5**  To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. ^verse-5

**6**  But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: ^verse-6

**7**  But contrariwise, when they saw that the [[#^note-7a|gospel]] of the un[[#^note-7b|circumcision]] was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto [[#^note-7c|Peter]]; ^verse-7

**8**  (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) ^verse-8

**9**  And when James, [[#^note-9a|Cephas]], and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the [[#^note-9b|grace]] that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of [[#^note-9c|fellowship]]; that we should go unto the [[#^note-9d|heathen]], and they unto the circumcision. ^verse-9

**10**  Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. ^verse-10

**11**  But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. ^verse-11

**12**  For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. ^verse-12

**13**  And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their [[#^note-13a|dissimulation]]. ^verse-13

**14**  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? ^verse-14

**15**  We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, ^verse-15

**16**  Knowing that a man is not [[#^note-16a|justified]] by the works of the [[#^note-16b|law]], but by the [[#^note-16c|faith]] of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the [[#^note-16d|works]] of the [[#^note-16e|law]]: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be [[#^note-16f|justified]]. ^verse-16

**17**  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. ^verse-17

**18**  For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. ^verse-18

**19**  For I through the law am [[#^note-19a|dead]] to the law, that I might [[#^note-19b|live]] unto God. ^verse-19

**20**  I am crucified with [[#^note-20a|Christ]]: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ [[#^note-20b|liveth]] in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the [[#^note-20c|faith]] of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. ^verse-20

**21**  I do not frustrate the [[#^note-21a|grace]] of God: for if righteousness come by the [[#^note-21b|law]], then Christ is dead in vain. ^verse-21
