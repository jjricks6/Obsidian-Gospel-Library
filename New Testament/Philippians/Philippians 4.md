### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Colossians|Next Entry]]

*Stand fast in the Lord—We believe in being honest, true, and chaste.*

**1**  Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so [[#^note-1a|stand fast]] in the Lord, my dearly beloved. ^verse-1

**2**  I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  And I entreat thee also, true [[#^note-3a|yokefellow]], help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the [[#^note-3b|book of life]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. ^verse-4

**5**  Let your [[#^note-5a|moderation]] be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Be]] [[#^note-6b|careful]] for nothing; but in every thing by [[#^note-6c|prayer]] and supplication with [[#^note-6d|thanksgiving]] let your requests be made known unto God. ^verse-6

**7**  And the [[#^note-7a|peace]] of God, which passeth all [[#^note-7b|understanding]], shall [[#^note-7c|keep]] your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. ^verse-7

**8**  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are [[#^note-8a|true]], whatsoever things are [[#^note-8b|honest]], whatsoever things are [[#^note-8c|just]], whatsoever things are [[#^note-8d|pure]], whatsoever things are [[#^note-8e|lovely]], [[#^note-8f|whatsoever]] things are of good report; if there be any [[#^note-8g|virtue]], and if there be any praise, [[#^note-8h|think]] on these things. ^verse-8

**9**  Those things, which ye have both learned, and [[#^note-9a|received]], and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. ^verse-9

**10**  But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your [[#^note-10a|care]] of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye [[#^note-10b|lacked]] opportunity. ^verse-10

**11**  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be [[#^note-11a|content]]. ^verse-11

**12**  I know both how to be [[#^note-12a|abased]], and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. ^verse-12

**13**  I can do all things through [[#^note-13a|Christ]] which [[#^note-13b|strengtheneth]] me. ^verse-13

**14**  Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did [[#^note-14a|communicate]] with my affliction. ^verse-14

**15**  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. ^verse-15

**16**  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. ^verse-16

**17**  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire [[#^note-17a|fruit]] that may abound to your account. ^verse-17

**18**  But I have all, and [[#^note-18a|abound]]: I am full, having received of [[#^note-18b|Epaphroditus]] the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. ^verse-18

**19**  But my God shall supply all your [[#^note-19a|need]] according to his [[#^note-19b|riches]] in glory by Christ Jesus. ^verse-19

**20**  Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-20

**21**  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. ^verse-21

**22**  All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of [[#^note-22a|Cæsar's]] household. ^verse-22

**23**  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. ^verse-23
