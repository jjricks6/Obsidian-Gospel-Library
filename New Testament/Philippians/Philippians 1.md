# The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Philippians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 2|Next Entry]]

*All that happened to Paul furthered the gospel causeâ€”Our conduct should be worthy of the gospel.*

**1**  Paul and Timotheus, the [[#^note-1a|servants]] of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the [[#^note-1b|bishops]] and [[#^note-1c|deacons]]: ^verse-1

**2**  Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, ^verse-3

**4**  Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, ^verse-4

**5**  For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; ^verse-5

**6**  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will [[#^note-6a|perform]] it until the day of Jesus Christ: ^verse-6

**7**  Even as it is [[#^note-7a|meet]] for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and [[#^note-7b|confirmation]] of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my [[#^note-7c|grace]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For God is my [[#^note-8a|record]], how greatly I long after you all in the [[#^note-8b|bowels]] of Jesus Christ. ^verse-8

**9**  And this I pray, that your [[#^note-9a|love]] may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; ^verse-9

**10**  That ye may [[#^note-10a|approve]] things that are excellent; that ye may be [[#^note-10b|sincere]] and without offence till the day of Christ; ^verse-10

**11**  Being filled with the fruits of [[#^note-11a|righteousness]], which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. ^verse-11

**12**  But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have [[#^note-12a|fallen out]] rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; ^verse-12

**13**  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the [[#^note-13a|palace]], and in all other places; ^verse-13

**14**  And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without [[#^note-14a|fear]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and [[#^note-15a|strife]]; and some also of good will: ^verse-15

**16**  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: ^verse-16

**17**  But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. ^verse-17

**18**  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. ^verse-18

**19**  For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your [[#^note-19a|prayer]], and the supply of the [[#^note-19b|Spirit]] of Jesus Christ, ^verse-19

**20**  According to my earnest expectation and my [[#^note-20a|hope]], that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be [[#^note-20b|magnified]] in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. ^verse-20

**21**  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. ^verse-21

**22**  But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I [[#^note-22a|wot]] not. ^verse-22

**23**  For I am [[#^note-23a|in a strait]] betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: ^verse-23

**24**  Nevertheless to [[#^note-24a|abide]] in the flesh is more needful for you. ^verse-24

**25**  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; ^verse-25

**26**  That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. ^verse-26

**27**  Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye [[#^note-27a|stand fast]] in [[#^note-27b|one]] spirit, with one [[#^note-27c|mind]] [[#^note-27d|striving]] together for the faith of the gospel; ^verse-27

**28**  And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: [[#^note-28a|which is]] to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. ^verse-28

**29**  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to [[#^note-29a|suffer]] for his sake; ^verse-29

**30**  Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. ^verse-30
