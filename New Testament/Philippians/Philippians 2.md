### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Philippians/Philippians 3|Next Entry]]

*Saints should be of one mind and one spirit—Every knee will bow to Christ—Saints must work out their salvation—Paul faces martyrdom with joy.*

**1**  If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any [[#^note-1a|bowels and mercies]], ^verse-1

**2**  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same [[#^note-2a|love]], being of [[#^note-2b|one]] [[#^note-2c|accord]], of one mind. ^verse-2

**3**  Let nothing be done through [[#^note-3a|strife]] or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each [[#^note-3b|esteem]] other better than themselves. ^verse-3

**4**  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. ^verse-4

**5**  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: ^verse-5

**6**  Who, being in the [[#^note-6a|form]] of God, thought it not robbery to be [[#^note-6b|equal]] with God: ^verse-6

**7**  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a [[#^note-7a|servant]], and was made in the likeness of men: ^verse-7

**8**  And being found in [[#^note-8a|fashion]] as a man, he [[#^note-8b|humbled]] himself, and became [[#^note-8c|obedient]] unto [[#^note-8d|death]], even the [[#^note-8e|death]] of the cross. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore God also hath highly [[#^note-9a|exalted]] him, and given him a [[#^note-9b|name]] which is above every name: ^verse-9

**10**  That at the [[#^note-10a|name]] of Jesus every [[#^note-10b|knee]] should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; ^verse-10

**11**  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is [[#^note-11a|Lord]], to the glory of God the Father. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, [[#^note-12a|work]] out your own [[#^note-12b|salvation]] with fear and trembling. ^verse-12

**13**  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. ^verse-13

**14**  Do all things without murmurings and [[#^note-14a|disputings]]: ^verse-14

**15**  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the [[#^note-15a|sons]] of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse [[#^note-15b|nation]], among whom ye [[#^note-15c|shine]] as lights in the world; ^verse-15

**16**  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. ^verse-16

**17**  Yea, and if I be [[#^note-17a|offered upon]] the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. ^verse-17

**18**  For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. ^verse-18

**19**  But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. ^verse-19

**20**  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. ^verse-20

**21**  For all [[#^note-21a|seek]] their [[#^note-21b|own]], not the things which are Jesus Christ's. ^verse-21

**22**  But ye know the [[#^note-22a|proof]] of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. ^verse-22

**23**  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. ^verse-23

**24**  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. ^verse-24

**25**  Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you [[#^note-25a|Epaphroditus]], my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. ^verse-25

**26**  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. ^verse-26

**27**  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. ^verse-27

**28**  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. ^verse-28

**29**  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all [[#^note-29a|gladness]]; and [[#^note-29b|hold]] such in [[#^note-29c|reputation]]: ^verse-29

**30**  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your [[#^note-30a|lack]] of service toward me. ^verse-30
