*Paul sacrifices all things for Christâ€”True ministers set examples of righteousness.*

**1**  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. ^verse-1

**2**  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. ^verse-2

**3**  For we are the [[#^note-3a|circumcision]], which [[#^note-3b|worship]] God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the [[#^note-3c|flesh]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: ^verse-4

**5**  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an [[#^note-5a|Hebrew]] of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a [[#^note-5b|Pharisee]]; ^verse-5

**6**  Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. ^verse-6

**7**  But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have [[#^note-8a|suffered]] the [[#^note-8b|loss]] of all things, and do count them but [[#^note-8c|dung]], that I may win Christ, ^verse-8

**9**  And be found in him, not having mine own [[#^note-9a|righteousness]], which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: ^verse-9

**10**  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the [[#^note-10a|fellowship]] of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; ^verse-10

**11**  If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the [[#^note-11a|dead]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Not as though I had already attained, either were already [[#^note-12a|perfect]]: but I [[#^note-12b|follow after]], if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. ^verse-12

**13**  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, ^verse-13

**14**  I [[#^note-14a|press]] toward the mark for the [[#^note-14b|prize]] of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. ^verse-14

**15**  Let us therefore, as many as be [[#^note-15a|perfect]], be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. ^verse-15

**16**  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. ^verse-16

**17**  Brethren, be [[#^note-17a|followers]] together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an [[#^note-17b|ensample]]. ^verse-17

**18**  (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: ^verse-18

**19**  Whose [[#^note-19a|end]] is destruction, whose God is their belly, [[#^note-19b|and]] whose glory is in their [[#^note-19c|shame]], who mind earthly things.) ^verse-19

**20**  For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the [[#^note-20a|Saviour]], the Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-20

**21**  Who shall [[#^note-21a|change]] our [[#^note-21b|vile]] body, [[#^note-21c|that]] it may be fashioned like unto his glorious [[#^note-21d|body]], according to the working whereby he is able even to [[#^note-21e|subdue]] all things unto himself. ^verse-21
