### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 5|Next Entry]]

*Peter explains why the gospel is preached to the dead—Saints should speak as the oracles of God—The righteous will be tried and tested in all things.*

**1**  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same [[#^note-1a|mind]]: [[#^note-1b|for]] he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from [[#^note-1c|sin]]; ^verse-1

**2**  That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the [[#^note-2a|lusts]] of men, but to the will of God. ^verse-2

**3**  For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, [[#^note-3a|excess]] of wine, [[#^note-3b|revellings]], banquetings, and [[#^note-3c|abominable]] [[#^note-3d|idolatries]]: ^verse-3

**4**  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: ^verse-4

**5**  Who shall give account to him that is ready to [[#^note-5a|judge]] the [[#^note-5b|quick]] and the dead. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|For]] for this cause was the [[#^note-6b|gospel]] [[#^note-6c|preached]] also to them that are [[#^note-6d|dead]], that they might be [[#^note-6e|judged]] according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|But]] the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and [[#^note-7b|watch]] unto prayer. ^verse-7

**8**  And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: [[#^note-8a|for]] [[#^note-8b|charity]] shall cover the multitude of sins. ^verse-8

**9**  Use [[#^note-9a|hospitality]] one to another without [[#^note-9b|grudging]]. ^verse-9

**10**  As every man hath received the gift, even so [[#^note-10a|minister]] the same one to another, as good [[#^note-10b|stewards]] of the manifold grace of God. ^verse-10

**11**  If any man [[#^note-11a|speak]], let him speak as the [[#^note-11b|oracles]] of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-11

**12**  Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery [[#^note-12a|trial]] which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: ^verse-12

**13**  But [[#^note-13a|rejoice]], inasmuch as ye are [[#^note-13b|partakers]] of Christ's [[#^note-13c|sufferings]]; that, when his glory shall be [[#^note-13d|revealed]], ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. ^verse-13

**14**  If ye be [[#^note-14a|reproached]] for the name of Christ, [[#^note-14b|happy]] are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. ^verse-14

**15**  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. ^verse-15

**16**  Yet if any man suffer as a [[#^note-16a|Christian]], let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. ^verse-16

**17**  For the time is come that [[#^note-17a|judgment]] must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that [[#^note-17b|obey not]] the gospel of God? ^verse-17

**18**  And if the [[#^note-18a|righteous]] scarcely be saved, where shall the [[#^note-18b|ungodly]] and the sinner appear? ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore let them that suffer according to the [[#^note-19a|will]] of God commit the [[#^note-19b|keeping]] of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator. ^verse-19
