### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Peter|Next Entry]]

*The elders are to feed the flock of Godâ€”Humility and godly graces lead to perfection.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|elders]] which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a [[#^note-1b|partaker]] of the glory that shall be revealed: ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Feed]] the [[#^note-2b|flock]] of God which is among you, taking the [[#^note-2c|oversight]] thereof, not by constraint, but [[#^note-2d|willingly]]; not for [[#^note-2e|filthy]] [[#^note-2f|lucre]], but of a ready mind; ^verse-2

**3**  Neither as being [[#^note-3a|lords]] over God's heritage, but being [[#^note-3b|ensamples]] to the flock. ^verse-3

**4**  And when the chief [[#^note-4a|Shepherd]] shall appear, ye shall receive a [[#^note-4b|crown]] of [[#^note-4c|glory]] that fadeth not away. ^verse-4

**5**  Likewise, ye younger, [[#^note-5a|submit]] yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with [[#^note-5b|humility]]: for God [[#^note-5c|resisteth]] the [[#^note-5d|proud]], and giveth grace to the [[#^note-5e|humble]]. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Humble]] yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: ^verse-6

**7**  Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. ^verse-7

**8**  Be [[#^note-8a|sober]], be [[#^note-8b|vigilant]]; because your adversary the [[#^note-8c|devil]], as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: ^verse-8

**9**  Whom resist [[#^note-9a|steadfast]] in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are [[#^note-9b|accomplished in]] your brethren that are in the world. ^verse-9

**10**  But the God of all [[#^note-10a|grace]], who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you [[#^note-10b|perfect]], stablish, strengthen, settle you. ^verse-10

**11**  To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-11

**12**  By [[#^note-12a|Silvanus]], a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. ^verse-12

**13**  The church that is at [[#^note-13a|Babylon]], elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. ^verse-13

**14**  Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. ^verse-14
