### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 4|Next Entry]]

*Husbands and wives should honor each other—Saints should live by gospel standards—Christ preached to the spirits in prison.*

**1**  Likewise, ye [[#^note-1a|wives]], be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any [[#^note-1b|obey not]] the word, they also may without the word be won by the [[#^note-1c|conversation]] of the wives; ^verse-1

**2**  While they behold your [[#^note-2a|chaste]] [[#^note-2b|conversation]] coupled with fear. ^verse-2

**3**  Whose [[#^note-3a|adorning]] let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; ^verse-3

**4**  But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the [[#^note-4a|ornament]] of a [[#^note-4b|meek]] and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. ^verse-4

**5**  For after this manner in the old time the holy [[#^note-5a|women]] also, who [[#^note-5b|trusted]] in God, adorned themselves, being [[#^note-5c|in subjection]] unto their own husbands: ^verse-5

**6**  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose [[#^note-6a|daughters]] ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any [[#^note-6b|amazement]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Likewise, ye [[#^note-7a|husbands]], dwell with them according to [[#^note-7b|knowledge]], giving [[#^note-7c|honour]] unto the [[#^note-7d|wife]], as unto the weaker vessel, and as being [[#^note-7e|heirs]] together of the grace of life; that your [[#^note-7f|prayers]] be not hindered. ^verse-7

**8**  Finally, be ye all of [[#^note-8a|one]] mind, having [[#^note-8b|compassion]] one of another, love as [[#^note-8c|brethren]], be [[#^note-8d|pitiful]], be [[#^note-8e|courteous]]: ^verse-8

**9**  Not [[#^note-9a|rendering]] [[#^note-9b|evil]] for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise [[#^note-9c|blessing]]; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. ^verse-9

**10**  For he that will love life, and see good days, let him [[#^note-10a|refrain]] his [[#^note-10b|tongue]] from evil, and his lips that they speak no [[#^note-10c|guile]]: ^verse-10

**11**  Let him [[#^note-11a|eschew]] evil, and do good; let him seek [[#^note-11b|peace]], and [[#^note-11c|ensue]] it. ^verse-11

**12**  For the [[#^note-12a|eyes]] of the Lord are over the [[#^note-12b|righteous]], and his ears are open unto their [[#^note-12c|prayers]]: but the face of the Lord is against them that do [[#^note-12d|evil]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And who is he that will harm you, if ye be [[#^note-13a|followers]] of that which is good? ^verse-13

**14**  But and if ye [[#^note-14a|suffer]] for [[#^note-14b|righteousness']] sake, [[#^note-14c|happy]] are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; ^verse-14

**15**  But [[#^note-15a|sanctify]] the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give [[#^note-15b|an answer]] to every man that asketh you a reason of the [[#^note-15c|hope]] that is in you with [[#^note-15d|meekness]] and [[#^note-15e|fear]]: ^verse-15

**16**  Having a good [[#^note-16a|conscience]]; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good [[#^note-16b|conversation]] in Christ. ^verse-16

**17**  For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye [[#^note-17a|suffer]] for well doing, than for evil doing. ^verse-17

**18**  For Christ also hath once [[#^note-18a|suffered]] for sins, the just for the [[#^note-18b|unjust]], that he might bring us to God, being put to [[#^note-18c|death]] in the flesh, but quickened by the [[#^note-18d|Spirit]]: ^verse-18

**19**  By which also he went and [[#^note-19a|preached]] unto the [[#^note-19b|spirits]] in [[#^note-19c|prison]]; ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Which]] sometime were [[#^note-20b|disobedient]], when once the [[#^note-20c|longsuffering]] of God waited in the days of [[#^note-20d|Noah]], while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were [[#^note-20e|saved]] by [[#^note-20f|water]]. ^verse-20

**21**  The like figure whereunto even [[#^note-21a|baptism]] doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: ^verse-21

**22**  Who is gone into [[#^note-22a|heaven]], and is on the right hand of God; [[#^note-22b|angels]] and [[#^note-22c|authorities]] and powers being made subject unto him. ^verse-22
