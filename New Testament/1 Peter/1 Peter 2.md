### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 3|Next Entry]]

*Converts are newborn babes in Christ—He is the chief cornerstone—Saints hold a royal priesthood and are a peculiar people—Saints are in subjection to the laws of man.*

**1**  Wherefore laying aside all [[#^note-1a|malice]], and all [[#^note-1b|guile]], and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil [[#^note-1c|speakings]], ^verse-1

**2**  As [[#^note-2a|newborn]] babes, desire the [[#^note-2b|sincere]] [[#^note-2c|milk]] of the word, that ye may grow thereby: ^verse-2

**3**  If so be ye have [[#^note-3a|tasted]] that the Lord is gracious. ^verse-3

**4**  To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but [[#^note-4a|chosen]] of God, and precious, ^verse-4

**5**  Ye also, as [[#^note-5a|lively]] stones, are built up a [[#^note-5b|spiritual]] [[#^note-5c|house]], an holy priesthood, to offer up [[#^note-5d|spiritual]] [[#^note-5e|sacrifices]], acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief [[#^note-6a|corner]] [[#^note-6b|stone]], elect, precious: and he that [[#^note-6c|believeth]] on him shall not be [[#^note-6d|confounded]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be [[#^note-7a|disobedient]], the stone which the builders [[#^note-7b|disallowed]], the same is made the head of the corner, ^verse-7

**8**  And a [[#^note-8a|stone]] of [[#^note-8b|stumbling]], and a [[#^note-8c|rock]] of [[#^note-8d|offence]], even to them which [[#^note-8e|stumble]] at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were [[#^note-8f|appointed]]. ^verse-8

**9**  But ye are a [[#^note-9a|chosen]] generation, a [[#^note-9b|royal]] [[#^note-9c|priesthood]], an [[#^note-9d|holy]] [[#^note-9e|nation]], a [[#^note-9f|peculiar]] people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of [[#^note-9g|darkness]] into his marvellous [[#^note-9h|light]]: ^verse-9

**10**  Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. ^verse-10

**11**  Dearly beloved, I beseech you as [[#^note-11a|strangers]] and [[#^note-11b|pilgrims]], [[#^note-11c|abstain]] from fleshly [[#^note-11d|lusts]], which [[#^note-11e|war]] against the soul; ^verse-11

**12**  Having your conversation [[#^note-12a|honest]] among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good [[#^note-12b|works]], which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Submit]] yourselves to every [[#^note-13b|ordinance]] of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as [[#^note-13c|supreme]]; ^verse-13

**14**  Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. ^verse-14

**15**  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to [[#^note-15a|silence]] the [[#^note-15b|ignorance]] of foolish men: ^verse-15

**16**  As free, and not using your [[#^note-16a|liberty]] for a cloak of [[#^note-16b|maliciousness]], but as the [[#^note-16c|servants]] of God. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Honour]] all men. Love the [[#^note-17b|brotherhood]]. [[#^note-17c|Fear]] God. Honour the [[#^note-17d|king]]. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Servants]], be subject to your [[#^note-18b|masters]] with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the [[#^note-18c|froward]]. ^verse-18

**19**  For this is [[#^note-19a|thankworthy]], if a man for conscience toward God endure [[#^note-19b|grief]], suffering wrongfully. ^verse-19

**20**  For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it [[#^note-20a|patiently]]? but if, when ye do well, and [[#^note-20b|suffer]] for it, ye take it [[#^note-20c|patiently]], this is [[#^note-20d|acceptable]] with God. ^verse-20

**21**  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also [[#^note-21a|suffered]] for us, leaving us an [[#^note-21b|example]], that ye should follow his steps: ^verse-21

**22**  Who did no [[#^note-22a|sin]], neither was [[#^note-22b|guile]] found in his mouth: ^verse-22

**23**  Who, when he was [[#^note-23a|reviled]], reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but [[#^note-23b|committed]] himself to him that judgeth righteously: ^verse-23

**24**  Who his own self [[#^note-24a|bare]] our [[#^note-24b|sins]] in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose [[#^note-24c|stripes]] ye were healed. ^verse-24

**25**  For ye were as [[#^note-25a|sheep]] going astray; but are now returned unto the [[#^note-25b|Shepherd]] and [[#^note-25c|Bishop]] of your souls. ^verse-25
