### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/1 Peter|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Peter/1 Peter 2|Next Entry]]

*The trial of our faith precedes salvationâ€”Christ was foreordained to be the Redeemer.*

**1**  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the [[#^note-1a|strangers]] scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Elect]] according to the [[#^note-2b|foreknowledge]] of God the Father, through [[#^note-2c|sanctification]] of the Spirit, unto [[#^note-2d|obedience]] and [[#^note-2e|sprinkling]] of the [[#^note-2f|blood]] of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. ^verse-2

**3**  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant [[#^note-3a|mercy]] hath [[#^note-3b|begotten]] us again unto a [[#^note-3c|lively]] [[#^note-3d|hope]] by the resurrection of [[#^note-3e|Jesus Christ]] from the dead, ^verse-3

**4**  To an [[#^note-4a|inheritance]] incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, ^verse-4

**5**  Who are kept by the [[#^note-5a|power]] of God through [[#^note-5b|faith]] unto salvation [[#^note-5c|ready]] to be revealed in the last time. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a [[#^note-6a|season]], if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold [[#^note-6b|temptations]]: ^verse-6

**7**  That the [[#^note-7a|trial]] of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the [[#^note-7b|appearing]] of Jesus Christ: ^verse-7

**8**  Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet [[#^note-8a|believing]], ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: ^verse-8

**9**  Receiving the [[#^note-9a|end]] of your [[#^note-9b|faith]], even the [[#^note-9c|salvation]] of your souls. ^verse-9

**10**  Of which [[#^note-10a|salvation]] the [[#^note-10b|prophets]] have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: ^verse-10

**11**  Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it [[#^note-11a|testified]] beforehand the [[#^note-11b|sufferings]] of Christ, and the [[#^note-11c|glory]] that should follow. ^verse-11

**12**  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have [[#^note-12a|preached]] the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the [[#^note-12b|angels]] desire to look into. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be [[#^note-13a|sober]], and hope [[#^note-13b|to the end]] for the [[#^note-13c|grace]] that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; ^verse-13

**14**  As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former [[#^note-14a|lusts]] in your [[#^note-14b|ignorance]]: ^verse-14

**15**  But as he which hath called you is [[#^note-15a|holy]], so be ye holy in all manner of [[#^note-15b|conversation]]; ^verse-15

**16**  Because it is written, Be ye [[#^note-16a|holy]]; for I am holy. ^verse-16

**17**  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's [[#^note-17a|work]], pass the time of your sojourning here in [[#^note-17b|fear]]: ^verse-17

**18**  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not [[#^note-18a|redeemed]] with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your [[#^note-18b|vain conversation]] received by [[#^note-18c|tradition]] from your fathers; ^verse-18

**19**  But with the precious [[#^note-19a|blood]] of Christ, as of a [[#^note-19b|lamb]] without [[#^note-19c|blemish]] and without spot: ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Who]] verily was [[#^note-20b|foreordained]] before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, ^verse-20

**21**  Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him [[#^note-21a|glory]]; that your [[#^note-21b|faith]] and [[#^note-21c|hope]] might be in God. ^verse-21

**22**  Seeing ye have [[#^note-22a|purified]] your [[#^note-22b|souls]] in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned [[#^note-22c|love]] of the brethren, see that ye [[#^note-22d|love]] one another with a pure heart fervently: ^verse-22

**23**  Being [[#^note-23a|born again]], not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and [[#^note-23b|abideth]] for ever. ^verse-23

**24**  For all [[#^note-24a|flesh]] is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: ^verse-24

**25**  But the [[#^note-25a|word]] of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. ^verse-25
