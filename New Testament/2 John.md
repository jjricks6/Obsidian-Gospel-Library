[[New Testament/1 John/1 John 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/3 John|Next Entry]]

*John rejoices because the children of the elect lady are true and faithful.*

**1**  The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; ^verse-1

**2**  For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. ^verse-2

**3**  Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. ^verse-3

**4**  I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. ^verse-4

**5**  And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. ^verse-5

**6**  And this is [[#^note-6a|love]], that we [[#^note-6b|walk]] after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the [[#^note-6c|beginning]], ye should walk in it. ^verse-6

**7**  For many [[#^note-7a|deceivers]] are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an [[#^note-7b|antichrist]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have [[#^note-8a|wrought]], but that we receive a full reward. ^verse-8

**9**  Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. ^verse-9

**10**  If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your [[#^note-10a|house]], neither bid him God speed: ^verse-10

**11**  For he that biddeth him God speed is [[#^note-11a|partaker]] of his evil deeds. ^verse-11

**12**  Having many things to [[#^note-12a|write]] unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. ^verse-12

**13**  The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen. ^verse-13
