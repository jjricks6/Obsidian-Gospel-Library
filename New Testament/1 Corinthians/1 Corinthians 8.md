[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 9|Next Entry]]

*There are many gods and many lordsâ€”To us there is one God (the Father) and one Lord, who is Christ.*

**1**  Now [[#^note-1a|as touching]] things offered unto [[#^note-1b|idols]], we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but [[#^note-1c|charity]] [[#^note-1d|edifieth]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And if any man think that he [[#^note-2a|know]]eth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. ^verse-2

**3**  But if any man love God, the same is [[#^note-3a|known]] of him. ^verse-3

**4**  As concerning therefore the eating of those things [[#^note-4a|that]] are offered in sacrifice unto [[#^note-4b|idols]], we know that an [[#^note-4c|idol]] is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. ^verse-4

**5**  For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) ^verse-5

**6**  But to us there is but one [[#^note-6a|God]], the [[#^note-6b|Father]], of whom are all things, and we in him; and one [[#^note-6c|Lord Jesus Christ]], by whom are [[#^note-6d|all]] things, and we by him. ^verse-6

**7**  Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with [[#^note-7a|conscience]] of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. ^verse-7

**8**  But [[#^note-8a|meat]] commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. ^verse-8

**9**  But take heed lest by any means this [[#^note-9a|liberty]] of yours become a [[#^note-9b|stumblingblock]] to them that are [[#^note-9c|weak]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; ^verse-10

**11**  And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? ^verse-11

**12**  But when ye sin so against the [[#^note-12a|brethren]], and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, if meat [[#^note-13a|make]] my brother to [[#^note-13b|offend]], I will [[#^note-13c|eat no]] flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend. ^verse-13
