# The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 2|Next Entry]]

*True Saints are perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment—Preach the gospel and save souls—The gospel is preached by the weak and the simple.*

**1**  Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, ^verse-1

**2**  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are [[#^note-2a|sanctified]] in Christ Jesus, called to be [[#^note-2b|saints]], with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: ^verse-2

**3**  Grace be unto you, and [[#^note-3a|peace]], from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-3

**4**  I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; ^verse-4

**5**  That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; ^verse-5

**6**  Even as the [[#^note-6a|testimony]] of Christ was [[#^note-6b|confirmed]] in you: ^verse-6

**7**  So that ye [[#^note-7a|come behind in]] no gift; waiting for the [[#^note-7b|coming]] of our Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-7

**8**  Who shall also [[#^note-8a|confirm]] you unto the end, that ye may be [[#^note-8b|blameless]] in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-8

**9**  God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the [[#^note-9a|fellowship]] of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no [[#^note-10a|divisions]] among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same [[#^note-10b|mind]] and in the same judgment. ^verse-10

**11**  For it hath been declared unto me [[#^note-11a|of]] you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are [[#^note-11b|contentions]] among you. ^verse-11

**12**  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of [[#^note-12a|Christ]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Is Christ [[#^note-13a|divided]]? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? ^verse-13

**14**  I thank God that I baptized none of you, [[#^note-14a|but]] [[#^note-14b|Crispus]] and Gaius; ^verse-14

**15**  Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. ^verse-15

**16**  And I baptized also the household of [[#^note-16a|Stephanas]]: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. ^verse-16

**17**  For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with [[#^note-17a|wisdom]] of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. ^verse-17

**18**  For the [[#^note-18a|preaching]] of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the [[#^note-18b|power]] of God. ^verse-18

**19**  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the [[#^note-19a|understanding]] of the [[#^note-19b|prudent]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Where is the wise? where is the [[#^note-20a|scribe]]? where is the [[#^note-20b|disputer]] of this [[#^note-20c|world]]? hath not God made foolish the [[#^note-20d|wisdom]] of this [[#^note-20e|world]]? ^verse-20

**21**  For after that in the wisdom of God the world [[#^note-21a|by]] wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of [[#^note-21b|preaching]] to save them that believe. ^verse-21

**22**  For the Jews require a [[#^note-22a|sign]], and the Greeks seek after wisdom: ^verse-22

**23**  But we [[#^note-23a|preach]] Christ [[#^note-23b|crucified]], unto the Jews a [[#^note-23c|stumblingblock]], and unto the Greeks foolishness; ^verse-23

**24**  But unto them [[#^note-24a|which are called]], both Jews and Greeks, Christ the [[#^note-24b|power]] of God, and the [[#^note-24c|wisdom]] of God. ^verse-24

**25**  Because the [[#^note-25a|foolishness]] of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. ^verse-25

**26**  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the [[#^note-26a|flesh]], not many mighty, not many noble, are [[#^note-26b|called]]: ^verse-26

**27**  But God hath chosen the [[#^note-27a|foolish]] things of the world to [[#^note-27b|confound]] the wise; and God hath chosen the [[#^note-27c|weak]] things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; ^verse-27

**28**  And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: ^verse-28

**29**  That no flesh should glory in his presence. ^verse-29

**30**  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and [[#^note-30a|sanctification]], and redemption: ^verse-30

**31**  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him [[#^note-31a|glory]] in the Lord. ^verse-31
