### Chapter 12

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 13|Next Entry]]

*The Holy Ghost reveals that Jesus is the Christ—Spiritual gifts are present among the Saints—Apostles, prophets, and miracles are found in the true Church.*

**1**  Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. ^verse-1

**2**  Ye know that ye were Gentiles, [[#^note-2a|carried away]] unto these dumb [[#^note-2b|idols]], even as ye were led. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can [[#^note-3a|say]] that Jesus is the [[#^note-3b|Lord]], but by the [[#^note-3c|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Now there are diversities of [[#^note-4a|gifts]], but the same Spirit. ^verse-4

**5**  And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. ^verse-6

**7**  But the manifestation of the [[#^note-7a|Spirit]] is given to every man to profit withal. ^verse-7

**8**  For to one is [[#^note-8a|given]] by the [[#^note-8b|Spirit]] the [[#^note-8c|word]] of [[#^note-8d|wisdom]]; to another the word of [[#^note-8e|knowledge]] by the same Spirit; ^verse-8

**9**  To another [[#^note-9a|faith]] by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of [[#^note-9b|healing]] by the same Spirit; ^verse-9

**10**  To another the working of [[#^note-10a|miracles]]; to another [[#^note-10b|prophecy]]; to another [[#^note-10c|discerning]] of spirits; to another divers kinds of [[#^note-10d|tongues]]; to another the interpretation of tongues: ^verse-10

**11**  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. ^verse-11

**12**  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one [[#^note-13a|body]], whether we be Jews or [[#^note-13b|Gentiles]], whether we be [[#^note-13c|bond]] or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. ^verse-13

**14**  For the body is not one member, but many. ^verse-14

**15**  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ^verse-15

**16**  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ^verse-16

**17**  If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? ^verse-17

**18**  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. ^verse-18

**19**  And if they were all one member, where were the body? ^verse-19

**20**  But now are they many members, yet but one body. ^verse-20

**21**  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the [[#^note-21a|head]] to the feet, I have no need of you. ^verse-21

**22**  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be [[#^note-22a|more feeble]], are necessary: ^verse-22

**23**  And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. ^verse-23

**24**  For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: ^verse-24

**25**  That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same [[#^note-25a|care]] one for another. ^verse-25

**26**  And whether one member [[#^note-26a|suffer]], all the members [[#^note-26b|suffer]] with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. ^verse-26

**27**  Now ye are the body of [[#^note-27a|Christ]], and [[#^note-27b|members]] in particular. ^verse-27

**28**  And God hath set some in the church, first [[#^note-28a|apostles]], secondarily [[#^note-28b|prophets]], thirdly [[#^note-28c|teachers]], after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, [[#^note-28d|governments]], diversities of tongues. ^verse-28

**29**  Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of [[#^note-29a|miracles]]? ^verse-29

**30**  Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? ^verse-30

**31**  But [[#^note-31a|covet earnestly]] the best [[#^note-31b|gifts]]: and yet shew I unto you a more [[#^note-31c|excellent]] way. ^verse-31
