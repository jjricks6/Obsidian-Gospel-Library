### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 7|Next Entry]]

*Church members should not fight one another in the courts—The unrighteous will not be saved—True Saints are the temple of the Holy Ghost.*

**1**  Dare any of you, having a [[#^note-1a|matter]] against another, go to [[#^note-1b|law]] before the unjust, and not before the saints? ^verse-1

**2**  Do ye not know that the saints shall [[#^note-2a|judge]] the [[#^note-2b|world]]? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? ^verse-2

**3**  Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? ^verse-3

**4**  If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. ^verse-4

**5**  I speak to your [[#^note-5a|shame]]. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? ^verse-5

**6**  But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. ^verse-6

**7**  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take [[#^note-7a|wrong]]? why do ye not rather [[#^note-7b|suffer]] yourselves to be [[#^note-7c|defrauded]]? ^verse-7

**8**  Nay, ye do wrong, and [[#^note-8a|defraud]], and that your brethren. ^verse-8

**9**  Know ye not that the [[#^note-9a|unrighteous]] shall not [[#^note-9b|inherit]] the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither [[#^note-9c|fornicators]], nor idolaters, nor [[#^note-9d|adulterers]], nor [[#^note-9e|effeminate]], nor [[#^note-9f|abusers]] of themselves with mankind, ^verse-9

**10**  Nor [[#^note-10a|thieves]], nor covetous, nor [[#^note-10b|drunkards]], nor [[#^note-10c|revilers]], nor [[#^note-10d|extortioners]], shall inherit the kingdom of God. ^verse-10

**11**  And such were some of you: but ye are [[#^note-11a|washed]], but ye are [[#^note-11b|sanctified]], but ye are justified in the [[#^note-11c|name]] of the Lord Jesus, and by the [[#^note-11d|Spirit]] of our God. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|All]] things are lawful unto me, but all things are not [[#^note-12b|expedient]]: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. ^verse-12

**13**  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for [[#^note-13a|fornication]], but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. ^verse-13

**14**  And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also [[#^note-14a|raise up]] us by his own power. ^verse-14

**15**  Know ye not that your bodies are the [[#^note-15a|members]] of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. ^verse-15

**16**  What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is [[#^note-16a|one]] body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. ^verse-16

**17**  But he that is joined unto the Lord is [[#^note-17a|one]] spirit. ^verse-17

**18**  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. ^verse-18

**19**  What? know ye not that your [[#^note-19a|body]] is the [[#^note-19b|temple]] of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your [[#^note-19c|own]]? ^verse-19

**20**  For ye are [[#^note-20a|bought]] with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. ^verse-20
