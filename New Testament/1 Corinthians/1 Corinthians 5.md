### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 6|Next Entry]]

*The Church cannot fellowship sinnersâ€”Christ, our passover, was sacrificed for us.*

**1**  It is reported commonly that there is [[#^note-1a|fornication]] among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. ^verse-1

**2**  And ye are [[#^note-2a|puffed up]], and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. ^verse-2

**3**  For I verily, [[#^note-3a|as]] absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, ^verse-3

**4**  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, [[#^note-4a|and my spirit, with]] the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, ^verse-4

**5**  To [[#^note-5a|deliver]] such an one unto Satan for the [[#^note-5b|destruction]] of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the [[#^note-5c|day]] of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-5

**6**  Your [[#^note-6a|glorying]] is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Purge]] out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are [[#^note-7b|unleavened]]. For even Christ our [[#^note-7c|passover]] is sacrificed for us: ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore let us keep the [[#^note-8a|feast]], not with old [[#^note-8b|leaven]], neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of [[#^note-8c|sincerity]] and truth. ^verse-8

**9**  I wrote unto you in an [[#^note-9a|epistle]] not to [[#^note-9b|company]] with [[#^note-9c|fornicators]]: ^verse-9

**10**  Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the [[#^note-10a|covetous]], or [[#^note-10b|extortioners]], or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. ^verse-10

**11**  But now I have written unto you not to keep [[#^note-11a|company]], if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a [[#^note-11b|drunkard]], or an extortioner; with such an one [[#^note-11c|no not]] to [[#^note-11d|eat]]. ^verse-11

**12**  For what have I to do to judge them also that are [[#^note-12a|without]]? do not ye [[#^note-12b|judge]] them that are within? ^verse-12

**13**  But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. ^verse-13
