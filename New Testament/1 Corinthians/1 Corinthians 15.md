### Chapter 15

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 16|Next Entry]]

*Christ died for our sins—He rose from the dead and was seen by many—All men will be resurrected—Paul speaks of baptism for the dead—The three degrees of glory are described—Victory over death comes through Christ.*

**1**  Moreover, brethren, I [[#^note-1a|declare]] unto you the [[#^note-1b|gospel]] which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; ^verse-1

**2**  By which also ye are [[#^note-2a|saved]], if ye [[#^note-2b|keep in memory]] what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. ^verse-2

**3**  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ [[#^note-3a|died]] for our [[#^note-3b|sins]] according to the scriptures; ^verse-3

**4**  And that he was buried, and that he [[#^note-4a|rose]] again the third day according to the scriptures: ^verse-4

**5**  And that he was [[#^note-5a|seen]] of [[#^note-5b|Cephas]], then of the twelve: ^verse-5

**6**  After that, he was [[#^note-6a|seen]] of [[#^note-6b|above]] five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. ^verse-6

**7**  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. ^verse-7

**8**  And last of all he was [[#^note-8a|seen]] of me also, as of one born out of due time. ^verse-8

**9**  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not [[#^note-9a|meet]] to be called an apostle, because I [[#^note-9b|persecuted]] the church of God. ^verse-9

**10**  But by the [[#^note-10a|grace]] of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I [[#^note-10b|laboured]] more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. ^verse-11

**12**  Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? ^verse-12

**13**  But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: ^verse-13

**14**  And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. ^verse-14

**15**  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have [[#^note-15a|testified]] of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. ^verse-15

**16**  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: ^verse-16

**17**  And if Christ be not raised, your faith is [[#^note-17a|vain]]; ye are yet in your sins. ^verse-17

**18**  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are [[#^note-18a|perished]]. ^verse-18

**19**  If in this [[#^note-19a|life]] only we have [[#^note-19b|hope]] in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. ^verse-19

**20**    But now is [[#^note-20a|Christ]] [[#^note-20b|risen]] from the dead, and become the [[#^note-20c|firstfruits]] of them that slept. ^verse-20

**21**  For since by man came [[#^note-21a|death]], by man came also the [[#^note-21b|resurrection]] of the dead. ^verse-21

**22**  For as in [[#^note-22a|Adam]] all [[#^note-22b|die]], even so in [[#^note-22c|Christ]] shall all be made [[#^note-22d|alive]]. ^verse-22

**23**  But every man in his own [[#^note-23a|order]]: Christ the [[#^note-23b|firstfruits]]; afterward they that are Christ's at his [[#^note-23c|coming]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have [[#^note-24a|put down]] all [[#^note-24b|rule]] and all [[#^note-24c|authority]] and [[#^note-24d|power]]. ^verse-24

**25**  For he must [[#^note-25a|reign]], till he hath put all [[#^note-25b|enemies]] under his [[#^note-25c|feet]]. ^verse-25

**26**  The last [[#^note-26a|enemy]] that shall be [[#^note-26b|destroyed]] is [[#^note-26c|death]]. ^verse-26

**27**  For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is [[#^note-27a|manifest]] that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. ^verse-27

**28**  And when all things shall be [[#^note-28a|subdued]] unto him, then shall the Son also himself be [[#^note-28b|subject]] unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. ^verse-28

**29**    Else what shall they do which are [[#^note-29a|baptized]] [[#^note-29b|for]] the dead, if the dead [[#^note-29c|rise]] not at all? why are they then baptized for the [[#^note-29d|dead]]? ^verse-29

**30**  And why stand we in [[#^note-30a|jeopardy]] every hour? ^verse-30

**31**  [[#^note-31a|I]] protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. ^verse-31

**32**  If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us [[#^note-32a|eat]] and drink; for [[#^note-32b|to morrow]] we die. ^verse-32

**33**  Be not deceived: evil [[#^note-33a|communications]] corrupt good manners. ^verse-33

**34**  Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your [[#^note-34a|shame]]. ^verse-34

**35**  But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? ^verse-35

**36**  Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it [[#^note-36a|die]]: ^verse-36

**37**  And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, [[#^note-37a|it may chance]] of wheat, or of some other grain: ^verse-37

**38**  But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. ^verse-38

**39**  All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. ^verse-39

**40**  [[#^note-40a|There]] are also [[#^note-40b|celestial]] bodies, and bodies [[#^note-40c|terrestrial]]: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. ^verse-40

**41**  There is one glory of the [[#^note-41a|sun]], and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the [[#^note-41b|stars]]: for one star [[#^note-41c|differeth]] from another star in [[#^note-41d|glory]]. ^verse-41

**42**  So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in [[#^note-42a|corruption]]; it is raised in incorruption: ^verse-42

**43**  It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in [[#^note-43a|glory]]: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: ^verse-43

**44**  It is sown a [[#^note-44a|natural]] body; it is raised a [[#^note-44b|spiritual body]]. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. ^verse-44

**45**  And so it is written, The [[#^note-45a|first]] man [[#^note-45b|Adam]] was made a living soul; the last [[#^note-45c|Adam]] was made a [[#^note-45d|quickening]] spirit. ^verse-45

**46**  Howbeit that was not [[#^note-46a|first]] which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. ^verse-46

**47**  The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. ^verse-47

**48**  As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. ^verse-48

**49**  And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. ^verse-49

**50**  Now this I say, brethren, that [[#^note-50a|flesh]] and [[#^note-50b|blood]] cannot [[#^note-50c|inherit]] the kingdom of God; neither doth [[#^note-50d|corruption]] inherit incorruption. ^verse-50

**51**  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all [[#^note-51a|sleep]], but we shall all be [[#^note-51b|changed]], ^verse-51

**52**  In a moment, in the [[#^note-52a|twinkling]] of an eye, at the last trump: for the [[#^note-52b|trumpet]] shall sound, and the [[#^note-52c|dead]] shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be [[#^note-52d|changed]]. ^verse-52

**53**  For this [[#^note-53a|corruptible]] must put on incorruption, and this [[#^note-53b|mortal]] must put on immortality. ^verse-53

**54**  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on [[#^note-54a|immortality]], then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, [[#^note-54b|Death]] is swallowed up in victory. ^verse-54

**55**  O [[#^note-55a|death]], where is thy sting? O [[#^note-55b|grave]], where is thy victory? ^verse-55

**56**  The sting of [[#^note-56a|death]] is sin; and the [[#^note-56b|strength]] of sin is the law. ^verse-56

**57**  But [[#^note-57a|thanks]] be to God, which giveth us the [[#^note-57b|victory]] through our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-57

**58**  Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye [[#^note-58a|steadfast]], unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. ^verse-58
