### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 4|Next Entry]]

*Milk comes before meat in the Church—Men's works will be tried by fire—The Saints are the temple of God, and if they are faithful, they will inherit all things.*

**1**  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. ^verse-1

**2**  I have fed you with [[#^note-2a|milk]], and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. ^verse-2

**3**  For ye are yet [[#^note-3a|carnal]]: for whereas there is among you [[#^note-3b|envying]], and [[#^note-3c|strife]], and [[#^note-3d|divisions]], are ye not carnal, and walk as men? ^verse-3

**4**  For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? ^verse-4

**5**  Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but [[#^note-5a|ministers]] by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? ^verse-5

**6**  I have [[#^note-6a|planted]], Apollos watered; but God [[#^note-6b|gave]] the [[#^note-6c|increase]]. ^verse-6

**7**  So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. ^verse-7

**8**  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own [[#^note-8a|reward]] according to his own labour. ^verse-8

**9**  For we are [[#^note-9a|labourers]] together with God: ye are God's [[#^note-9b|husbandry]], ye are God's building. ^verse-9

**10**  According to the [[#^note-10a|grace]] of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. ^verse-10

**11**  For other [[#^note-11a|foundation]] can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ^verse-11

**12**  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; ^verse-12

**13**  Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by [[#^note-13a|fire]]; and the fire shall [[#^note-13b|try]] every man's work of what sort it is. ^verse-13

**14**    If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. ^verse-14

**15**  If any man's work [[#^note-15a|shall]] be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. ^verse-15

**16**  Know ye not that ye are the [[#^note-16a|temple]] of God, and that the [[#^note-16b|Spirit]] of God dwelleth [[#^note-16c|in]] you? ^verse-16

**17**  If any man [[#^note-17a|defile]] the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is [[#^note-17b|holy]], which temple ye are. ^verse-17

**18**  Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you [[#^note-18a|seemeth]] to be wise in this world, let him become a [[#^note-18b|fool]], that he may be [[#^note-18c|wise]]. ^verse-18

**19**  For the [[#^note-19a|wisdom]] of this [[#^note-19b|world]] is [[#^note-19c|foolishness]] with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own [[#^note-19d|craftiness]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And again, The Lord [[#^note-20a|knoweth]] the thoughts of the wise, that they are [[#^note-20b|vain]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore let no man [[#^note-21a|glory]] in men. For all things are yours; ^verse-21

**22**  Whether [[#^note-22a|Paul]], or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; [[#^note-22b|all]] are yours; ^verse-22

**23**  And ye are [[#^note-23a|Christ's]]; and Christ is God's. ^verse-23
