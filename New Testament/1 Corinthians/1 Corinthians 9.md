[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 10|Next Entry]]

*Paul rejoices in his Christian liberty—He preaches the gospel to all without charge—He is all things to all men to gain converts.*

**1**  Am I not an [[#^note-1a|apostle]]? am I not free? have I not [[#^note-1b|seen]] Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my [[#^note-1c|work]] in the Lord? ^verse-1

**2**  If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the [[#^note-2a|seal]] of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  Mine [[#^note-3a|answer]] to them that do [[#^note-3b|examine]] me is this, ^verse-3

**4**  Have we not power to eat and to drink? ^verse-4

**5**  Have we not power to lead about a sister, a [[#^note-5a|wife]], as well as other apostles, and as the [[#^note-5b|brethren]] of the Lord, and Cephas? ^verse-5

**6**  Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? ^verse-6

**7**  Who goeth a [[#^note-7a|warfare]] any time at his own charges? who planteth a [[#^note-7b|vineyard]], and [[#^note-7c|eateth]] not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? ^verse-7

**8**  Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? ^verse-8

**9**  For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not [[#^note-9a|muzzle]] the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? ^verse-9

**10**  Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is [[#^note-10a|written]]: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be [[#^note-10b|partaker]] of his hope. ^verse-10

**11**  If we have sown unto you [[#^note-11a|spiritual]] things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? ^verse-11

**12**  If others be partakers of this [[#^note-12a|power]] over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. ^verse-12

**13**  Do ye not know that they which [[#^note-13a|minister]] about holy things [[#^note-13b|live]] of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? ^verse-13

**14**  Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which [[#^note-14a|preach]] the [[#^note-14b|gospel]] should [[#^note-14c|live]] of the gospel. ^verse-14

**15**  But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. ^verse-15

**16**  For though I preach the [[#^note-16a|gospel]], I have nothing to glory of: for [[#^note-16b|necessity]] is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I [[#^note-16c|preach]] not the gospel! ^verse-16

**17**  For if I do this thing [[#^note-17a|willingly]], I have a [[#^note-17b|reward]]: but if against my will, a [[#^note-17c|dispensation]] of the gospel is committed unto me. ^verse-17

**18**  What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without [[#^note-18a|charge]], that I abuse not my power in the gospel. ^verse-18

**19**  For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself [[#^note-19a|servant]] unto all, that I might gain the more. ^verse-19

**20**  And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; ^verse-20

**21**  To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. ^verse-21

**22**  To the [[#^note-22a|weak]] became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made [[#^note-22b|all]] things to all men, that I might by all means save some. ^verse-22

**23**  And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. ^verse-23

**24**  Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. ^verse-24

**25**  And every man that striveth for the [[#^note-25a|mastery]] is [[#^note-25b|temperate]] in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible [[#^note-25c|crown]]; but we an [[#^note-25d|incorruptible]]. ^verse-25

**26**  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: ^verse-26

**27**  But I [[#^note-27a|keep under]] my [[#^note-27b|body]], and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. ^verse-27
