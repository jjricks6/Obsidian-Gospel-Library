### Chapter 10

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 11|Next Entry]]

*Christ is the God of Israel and the spiritual Rock that guided them—Ancient Israel rebelled against Christ—Paul contrasts true and false sacraments.*

**1**  Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the [[#^note-1a|cloud]], and all passed through the [[#^note-1b|sea]]; ^verse-1

**2**  And were all [[#^note-2a|baptized]] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; ^verse-2

**3**  And did all eat the same spiritual [[#^note-3a|meat]]; ^verse-3

**4**  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual [[#^note-4a|Rock]] that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. ^verse-4

**5**  But with many of them [[#^note-5a|God]] was not well [[#^note-5b|pleased]]: for they were [[#^note-5c|overthrown]] in the [[#^note-5d|wilderness]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Now these things were our [[#^note-6a|examples]], to the intent we should not [[#^note-6b|lust after]] evil things, as they also lusted. ^verse-6

**7**  Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The [[#^note-7a|people]] sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. ^verse-7

**8**  Neither let us commit [[#^note-8a|fornication]], as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. ^verse-8

**9**  Neither let us [[#^note-9a|tempt]] Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. ^verse-9

**10**  Neither [[#^note-10a|murmur]] ye, as some of them also murmured, and were [[#^note-10b|destroyed]] of the destroyer. ^verse-10

**11**  Now all these things happened unto them for [[#^note-11a|ensamples]]: [[#^note-11b|and]] they are [[#^note-11c|written]] for our [[#^note-11d|admonition]], upon whom the ends of the world are come. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore let him that thinketh he [[#^note-12a|standeth]] take heed lest he [[#^note-12b|fall]]. ^verse-12

**13**  There hath no temptation [[#^note-13a|taken]] you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be [[#^note-13b|tempted]] above that ye are able; but will with the [[#^note-13c|temptation]] also make a way to [[#^note-13d|escape]], that ye may be able to [[#^note-13e|bear]] it. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from [[#^note-14a|idolatry]]. ^verse-14

**15**  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. ^verse-15

**16**  The [[#^note-16a|cup]] of [[#^note-16b|blessing]] which we bless, is it not the [[#^note-16c|communion]] of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? ^verse-16

**17**  For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices [[#^note-18a|partakers]] of the altar? ^verse-18

**19**  What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to [[#^note-19a|idols]] is any thing? ^verse-19

**20**  But I say, that the things which the Gentiles [[#^note-20a|sacrifice]], they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. ^verse-20

**21**  Ye cannot drink the [[#^note-21a|cup]] of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. ^verse-21

**22**  Do we provoke the Lord to [[#^note-22a|jealousy]]? are we stronger than he? ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|All]] things are lawful for me, but all things are not [[#^note-23b|expedient]]: all things are lawful for me, but all things [[#^note-23c|edify]] not. ^verse-23

**24**  Let no man seek his [[#^note-24a|own]], but every man another's [[#^note-24b|wealth]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Whatsoever is sold in the [[#^note-25a|shambles]], that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: ^verse-25

**26**  For the [[#^note-26a|earth]] is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. ^verse-26

**27**  If any of them that believe not bid you to a [[#^note-27a|feast]], and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. ^verse-27

**28**  But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: ^verse-28

**29**  Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's [[#^note-29a|conscience]]? ^verse-29

**30**  For if I [[#^note-30a|by grace]] be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? ^verse-30

**31**  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye [[#^note-31a|do]], do all to the glory of God. ^verse-31

**32**  Give none [[#^note-32a|offence]], neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: ^verse-32

**33**  Even as I please all men in all things, not [[#^note-33a|seeking]] mine own [[#^note-33b|profit]], but the profit of many, that they may be [[#^note-33c|saved]]. ^verse-33
