### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 3|Next Entry]]

*The gospel is preached by the power of the Spirit—The Spirit reveals all things to the Saints—The unrepentant natural man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God.*

**1**  And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the [[#^note-1a|testimony]] of God. ^verse-1

**2**  For I determined not to know any thing among you, [[#^note-2a|save]] Jesus Christ, and him [[#^note-2b|crucified]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And I was with you in [[#^note-3a|weakness]], and in fear, and in much trembling. ^verse-3

**4**  And my [[#^note-4a|speech]] and my preaching was not with [[#^note-4b|enticing]] words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the [[#^note-4c|Spirit]] and of [[#^note-4d|power]]: ^verse-4

**5**  That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the [[#^note-5a|power]] of God. ^verse-5

**6**  Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are [[#^note-6a|perfect]]: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: ^verse-6

**7**  But we speak the [[#^note-7a|wisdom]] of God in a [[#^note-7b|mystery]], even the hidden [[#^note-7c|wisdom]], which God [[#^note-7d|ordained]] before the world unto our glory: ^verse-7

**8**  Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have [[#^note-8a|crucified]] the Lord of glory. ^verse-8

**9**  But as it is written, [[#^note-9a|Eye]] hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath [[#^note-9b|prepared]] for them that love him. ^verse-9

**10**  But God hath [[#^note-10a|revealed]] them unto us by his [[#^note-10b|Spirit]]: for the [[#^note-10c|Spirit]] [[#^note-10d|searcheth]] all things, yea, the deep things of God. ^verse-10

**11**  For what man [[#^note-11a|knoweth]] the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God [[#^note-11b|knoweth]] no man, [[#^note-11c|but]] the [[#^note-11d|Spirit]] of God. ^verse-11

**12**  Now we have received, not the [[#^note-12a|spirit]] of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. ^verse-12

**13**  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's [[#^note-13a|wisdom]] [[#^note-13b|teacheth]], but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. ^verse-13

**14**  But the [[#^note-14a|natural man]] [[#^note-14b|receiveth]] not the things of the [[#^note-14c|Spirit]] of God: for they are [[#^note-14d|foolishness]] unto him: neither can he [[#^note-14e|know]] them, because they are [[#^note-14f|spiritually]] [[#^note-14g|discerned]]. ^verse-14

**15**  But he that is spiritual [[#^note-15a|judgeth]] all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. ^verse-15

**16**  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may [[#^note-16a|instruct]] him? But we have the [[#^note-16b|mind]] of Christ. ^verse-16
