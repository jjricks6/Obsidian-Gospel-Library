### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 5|Next Entry]]

*Christ's ministers must be faithful—The Apostles suffer, minister, and keep the faith—The kingdom of God is not in word but in power.*

**1**  Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the [[#^note-1a|mysteries]] of God. ^verse-1

**2**  Moreover it is required in [[#^note-2a|stewards]], that a man be found [[#^note-2b|faithful]]. ^verse-2

**3**  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. ^verse-3

**4**  For I know nothing [[#^note-4a|by myself]]; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that [[#^note-4b|judgeth]] me is the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the [[#^note-5a|hidden things]] of darkness, and will make [[#^note-5b|manifest]] the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. ^verse-5

**6**  And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be [[#^note-6a|puffed up for]] one against another. ^verse-6

**7**  For who maketh thee [[#^note-7a|to differ from]] another? and what hast thou that thou didst not [[#^note-7b|receive]]? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? ^verse-7

**8**  Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. ^verse-8

**9**  For I think that God hath set forth us the [[#^note-9a|apostles last]], as it were [[#^note-9b|appointed]] to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. ^verse-9

**10**  We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. ^verse-10

**11**  Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are [[#^note-11a|buffeted]], and have no certain dwellingplace; ^verse-11

**12**  And [[#^note-12a|labour]], working with our [[#^note-12b|own]] [[#^note-12c|hands]]: being [[#^note-12d|reviled]], we bless; being [[#^note-12e|persecuted]], we [[#^note-12f|suffer it]]: ^verse-12

**13**  Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. ^verse-13

**14**  I write not these things to [[#^note-14a|shame]] you, but as my beloved [[#^note-14b|sons]] I [[#^note-14c|warn]] you. ^verse-14

**15**  For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the [[#^note-15a|gospel]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Wherefore I beseech you, be ye [[#^note-16a|followers]] of me. ^verse-16

**17**  For this cause have I sent unto you [[#^note-17a|Timotheus]], who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. ^verse-17

**18**  Now some are [[#^note-18a|puffed up]], as though I would not come to you. ^verse-18

**19**  But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. ^verse-19

**20**  For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in [[#^note-20a|power]]. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|What will ye]]? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of [[#^note-21b|meekness]]? ^verse-21
