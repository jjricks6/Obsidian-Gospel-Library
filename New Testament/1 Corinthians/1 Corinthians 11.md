### Chapter 11

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 10|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 12|Next Entry]]

*Paul speaks of certain customs of hair and grooming—Heresies will arise that test and prove the faithful—The sacramental emblems are partaken in remembrance of the flesh and blood of Christ—Beware of partaking unworthily.*

**1**  Be ye [[#^note-1a|followers]] of me, even as I also am of Christ. ^verse-1

**2**  Now I praise you, brethren, [[#^note-2a|that]] ye remember me in all things, and keep the [[#^note-2b|ordinances]], as I delivered them to you. ^verse-2

**3**  But I would have you know, that the [[#^note-3a|head]] of every man is Christ; and the head of the [[#^note-3b|woman]] is the man; and the [[#^note-3c|head]] of Christ is God. ^verse-3

**4**  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. ^verse-4

**5**  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is [[#^note-5a|even all one as]] if she were shaven. ^verse-5

**6**  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a [[#^note-6a|shame]] for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. ^verse-6

**7**  For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. ^verse-7

**8**  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. ^verse-8

**9**  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. ^verse-9

**10**  For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. ^verse-10

**11**  Nevertheless neither is the [[#^note-11a|man]] without the [[#^note-11b|woman]], neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. ^verse-12

**13**  Judge in yourselves: is it [[#^note-13a|comely]] that a woman pray unto God uncovered? ^verse-13

**14**  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long [[#^note-14a|hair]], it is a shame unto him? ^verse-14

**15**  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. ^verse-15

**16**  But if any man seem to be [[#^note-16a|contentious]], we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. ^verse-16

**17**  Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. ^verse-17

**18**  For first of all, when ye come together in the [[#^note-18a|church]], I hear that there be [[#^note-18b|divisions]] among you; and I partly believe it. ^verse-18

**19**  For there must be also [[#^note-19a|heresies]] among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. ^verse-19

**20**  When ye come together therefore into one place, [[#^note-20a|this]] is not to eat the Lord's supper. ^verse-20

**21**  For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. ^verse-21

**22**  What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the [[#^note-22a|church]] of God, and [[#^note-22b|shame]] them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. ^verse-22

**23**  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took [[#^note-23a|bread]]: ^verse-23

**24**  And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in [[#^note-24a|remembrance]] of me. ^verse-24

**25**  After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. ^verse-25

**26**  For as often as ye eat this [[#^note-26a|bread]], and drink this cup, ye do [[#^note-26b|shew]] the Lord's [[#^note-26c|death]] till he come. ^verse-26

**27**  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this [[#^note-27a|bread]], and drink this cup of the Lord, [[#^note-27b|unworthily]], shall [[#^note-27c|be]] [[#^note-27d|guilty]] of the body and blood of the Lord. ^verse-27

**28**  But let a man [[#^note-28a|examine]] himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. ^verse-28

**29**  For he that eateth and drinketh [[#^note-29a|unworthily]], eateth and drinketh [[#^note-29b|damnation]] to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. ^verse-29

**30**  For this cause many are weak and [[#^note-30a|sickly]] among you, and many sleep. ^verse-30

**31**  For if we would [[#^note-31a|judge]] ourselves, we should not be judged. ^verse-31

**32**  But when we are judged, we are [[#^note-32a|chastened]] of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. ^verse-32

**33**  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. ^verse-33

**34**  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. ^verse-34
