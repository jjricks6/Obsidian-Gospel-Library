*Paul counsels, Stand fast in the faith; let all things be done with charity.*

**1**  Now concerning the [[#^note-1a|collection]] for the saints, as I have [[#^note-1b|given order to]] the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. ^verse-1

**2**  Upon the [[#^note-2a|first]] day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath [[#^note-2b|prospered]] him, that there be no gatherings when I come. ^verse-2

**3**  And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your [[#^note-3a|liberality]] unto Jerusalem. ^verse-3

**4**  And if it be [[#^note-4a|meet]] that I go also, they shall go with me. ^verse-4

**5**  Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. ^verse-5

**6**  And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. ^verse-6

**7**  For I will not see you now [[#^note-7a|by the way]]; but I [[#^note-7b|trust]] to [[#^note-7c|tarry]] a while with you, if the Lord permit. ^verse-7

**8**  But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. ^verse-8

**9**  For a great [[#^note-9a|door]] and [[#^note-9b|effectual]] is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. ^verse-9

**10**  Now if [[#^note-10a|Timotheus]] come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. ^verse-10

**11**  Let no man therefore [[#^note-11a|despise]] him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. ^verse-11

**12**  As touching our brother [[#^note-12a|Apollos]], I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Watch]] ye, [[#^note-13b|stand fast]] in the [[#^note-13c|faith]], [[#^note-13d|quit]] you like [[#^note-13e|men]], be strong. ^verse-13

**14**  Let all your things be done with [[#^note-14a|charity]]. ^verse-14

**15**  I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of [[#^note-15a|Stephanas]], that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have [[#^note-15b|addicted]] themselves to the ministry of the saints,) ^verse-15

**16**  That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. ^verse-16

**17**  I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was [[#^note-17a|lacking]] on your part they have supplied. ^verse-17

**18**  For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. ^verse-18

**19**  The churches of Asia salute you. [[#^note-19a|Aquila]] and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. ^verse-19

**20**  All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy [[#^note-20a|kiss]]. ^verse-20

**21**  The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. ^verse-21

**22**  If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema [[#^note-22a|Maran-atha]]. ^verse-22

**23**  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ^verse-23

**24**  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. ^verse-24
