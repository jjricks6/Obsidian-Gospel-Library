### Chapter 13

[[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 14|Next Entry]]

*Paul discusses the high status of charityâ€”Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost all else.*

**1**  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not [[#^note-1a|charity]], I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. ^verse-1

**2**  And though I have the gift of [[#^note-2a|prophecy]], and understand all [[#^note-2b|mysteries]], and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. ^verse-2

**3**  And though I bestow all my goods to feed the [[#^note-3a|poor]], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Charity]] [[#^note-4b|suffereth]] long, and is [[#^note-4c|kind]]; charity [[#^note-4d|envieth]] not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, ^verse-4

**5**  Doth not behave itself [[#^note-5a|unseemly]], [[#^note-5b|seeketh not]] her own, is not easily [[#^note-5c|provoked]], thinketh no evil; ^verse-5

**6**  Rejoiceth not in [[#^note-6a|iniquity]], but rejoiceth in the [[#^note-6b|truth]]; ^verse-6

**7**  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. ^verse-7

**8**  Charity never [[#^note-8a|faileth]]: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. ^verse-8

**9**  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. ^verse-9

**10**  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. ^verse-10

**11**  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. ^verse-11

**12**  For now we see through a [[#^note-12a|glass]], [[#^note-12b|darkly]]; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. ^verse-12

**13**  And now abideth [[#^note-13a|faith]], [[#^note-13b|hope]], [[#^note-13c|charity]], these three; but the greatest of these is charity. ^verse-13
