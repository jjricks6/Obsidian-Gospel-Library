### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Titus|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 2|Next Entry]]

*Eternal life was promised before the world began—The qualifications of bishops are given—Unto the pure, all things are pure.*

**1**  Paul, a [[#^note-1a|servant]] of God, and an [[#^note-1b|apostle]] of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's [[#^note-1c|elect]], and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; ^verse-1

**2**  In [[#^note-2a|hope]] of [[#^note-2b|eternal life]], which God, that cannot [[#^note-2c|lie]], [[#^note-2d|promised]] before the world began; ^verse-2

**3**  But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; ^verse-3

**4**  To Titus, [[#^note-4a|mine own son after]] the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. ^verse-4

**5**  For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in [[#^note-5a|order]] the things that are wanting, and [[#^note-5b|ordain]] [[#^note-5c|elders]] in every city, as I had [[#^note-5d|appointed]] thee: ^verse-5

**6**  If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of [[#^note-6a|riot or unruly]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For a [[#^note-7a|bishop]] must be blameless, as the [[#^note-7b|steward]] of God; not [[#^note-7c|selfwilled]], not soon [[#^note-7d|angry]], not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; ^verse-7

**8**  But a lover of [[#^note-8a|hospitality]], a lover of [[#^note-8b|good men]], sober, just, holy, [[#^note-8c|temperate]]; ^verse-8

**9**  Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to [[#^note-9a|convince]] the [[#^note-9b|gainsayers]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For there are many unruly and [[#^note-10a|vain talkers]] and [[#^note-10b|deceivers]], specially they of the [[#^note-10c|circumcision]]: ^verse-10

**11**  Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy [[#^note-11a|lucre's]] sake. ^verse-11

**12**  One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, [[#^note-12a|slow bellies]]. ^verse-12

**13**  This witness is true. Wherefore [[#^note-13a|rebuke]] them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; ^verse-13

**14**  Not giving heed to Jewish [[#^note-14a|fables]], and [[#^note-14b|commandments]] of men, [[#^note-14c|that]] turn from the truth. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Unto]] the [[#^note-15b|pure]] all things are pure: but unto them that are [[#^note-15c|defiled]] and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their [[#^note-15d|mind]] and [[#^note-15e|conscience]] is [[#^note-15f|defiled]]. ^verse-15

**16**  They [[#^note-16a|profess]] that they [[#^note-16b|know]] God; but in [[#^note-16c|works]] they [[#^note-16d|deny]] him, being abominable, and [[#^note-16e|disobedient]], and unto every good work [[#^note-16f|reprobate]]. ^verse-16
