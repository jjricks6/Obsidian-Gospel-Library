[[New Testament/Titus/Titus 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Titus/Titus 3|Next Entry]]

*Saints should live righteously, deny ungodliness, and seek the Lord.*

**1**  But [[#^note-1a|speak]] thou the things which become sound [[#^note-1b|doctrine]]: ^verse-1

**2**  That the [[#^note-2a|aged]] men be [[#^note-2b|sober]], grave, [[#^note-2c|temperate]], sound in faith, in charity, in patience. ^verse-2

**3**  The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not [[#^note-3a|false]] [[#^note-3b|accusers]], not given to much wine, teachers of good things; ^verse-3

**4**  That they may teach the young [[#^note-4a|women]] to be sober, to [[#^note-4b|love]] their husbands, to love their children, ^verse-4

**5**  To be discreet, [[#^note-5a|chaste]], [[#^note-5b|keepers]] at [[#^note-5c|home]], good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. ^verse-5

**6**  Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. ^verse-6

**7**  In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, [[#^note-7a|gravity]], [[#^note-7b|sincerity]], ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Sound]] speech, that cannot be [[#^note-8b|condemned]]; that he that is [[#^note-8c|of the contrary part]] may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. ^verse-8

**9**  Exhort [[#^note-9a|servants]] to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not [[#^note-9b|answering again]]; ^verse-9

**10**  Not [[#^note-10a|purloining]], but shewing all good fidelity; that they may [[#^note-10b|adorn]] the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. ^verse-10

**11**  For the [[#^note-11a|grace]] of God [[#^note-11b|that]] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, ^verse-11

**12**  Teaching us that, denying [[#^note-12a|ungodliness]] and [[#^note-12b|worldly]] [[#^note-12c|lusts]], we should live [[#^note-12d|soberly]], [[#^note-12e|righteously]], and godly, in this present world; ^verse-12

**13**  Looking for that blessed hope, and the [[#^note-13a|glorious]] appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; ^verse-13

**14**  Who gave [[#^note-14a|himself]] for us, that he might [[#^note-14b|redeem]] us from all iniquity, and [[#^note-14c|purify]] unto himself a [[#^note-14d|peculiar people]], [[#^note-14e|zealous]] of good works. ^verse-14

**15**  These things speak, and exhort, and [[#^note-15a|rebuke]] with all [[#^note-15b|authority]]. Let no man [[#^note-15c|despise]] thee. ^verse-15
