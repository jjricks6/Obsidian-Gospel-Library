### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/Titus/Titus 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Philemon|Next Entry]]

*Saints must live righteously after baptism.*

**1**  Put them in mind to be [[#^note-1a|subject]] to [[#^note-1b|principalities]] and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, ^verse-1

**2**  To [[#^note-2a|speak evil]] of no man, to be [[#^note-2b|no brawlers]], but gentle, shewing all [[#^note-2c|meekness]] unto all men. ^verse-2

**3**  For we ourselves also were [[#^note-3a|sometimes]] foolish, [[#^note-3b|disobedient]], deceived, serving divers [[#^note-3c|lusts]] and pleasures, living in [[#^note-3d|malice]] and envy, hateful, and hating one another. ^verse-3

**4**  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, ^verse-4

**5**  Not by works of [[#^note-5a|righteousness]] which we have done, but according to his [[#^note-5b|mercy]] he saved us, by the [[#^note-5c|washing]] of regeneration, and [[#^note-5d|renewing]] of the Holy Ghost; ^verse-5

**6**  Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; ^verse-6

**7**  That being [[#^note-7a|justified]] by his grace, we should be made [[#^note-7b|heirs]] according to the hope of eternal life. ^verse-7

**8**  This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good [[#^note-8a|works]]. These things are good and profitable unto men. ^verse-8

**9**  But avoid [[#^note-9a|foolish]] questions, and genealogies, and [[#^note-9b|contentions]], and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. ^verse-9

**10**  A man that is an [[#^note-10a|heretick]] after the first and second [[#^note-10b|admonition]] reject; ^verse-10

**11**  Knowing that he that is such is [[#^note-11a|subverted]], and sinneth, being condemned of himself. ^verse-11

**12**  When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. ^verse-12

**13**  Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. ^verse-13

**14**  And let [[#^note-14a|ours]] also learn to maintain [[#^note-14b|good works]] for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. ^verse-14

**15**  All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. ^verse-15
