# The Epistle of Paul to Philemon

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Titus/Titus 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews|Next Entry]]

*The gospel changes a servant into a brother.*

**1**  Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, ^verse-1

**2**  And to our beloved Apphia, and [[#^note-2a|Archippus]] our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: ^verse-2

**3**  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-3

**4**  I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, ^verse-4

**5**  Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; ^verse-5

**6**  That the [[#^note-6a|communication]] of thy faith may become [[#^note-6b|effectual]] by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. ^verse-6

**7**  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the [[#^note-7a|bowels]] of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, ^verse-8

**9**  Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. ^verse-9

**10**  I beseech thee for my son [[#^note-10a|Onesimus]], whom I have begotten in my bonds: ^verse-10

**11**  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: ^verse-11

**12**  Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: ^verse-12

**13**  Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: ^verse-13

**14**  But without thy [[#^note-14a|mind]] would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. ^verse-14

**15**  For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; ^verse-15

**16**  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a [[#^note-16a|brother]] beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? ^verse-16

**17**  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. ^verse-17

**18**  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee [[#^note-18a|ought]], put that on mine account; ^verse-18

**19**  I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. ^verse-19

**20**  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. ^verse-20

**21**  Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. ^verse-21

**22**  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your [[#^note-22a|prayers]] I shall be given unto you. ^verse-22

**23**  There salute thee [[#^note-23a|Epaphras]], my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; ^verse-23

**24**  Marcus, Aristarchus, [[#^note-24a|Demas]], Lucas, my fellowlabourers. ^verse-24

**25**  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ^verse-25
