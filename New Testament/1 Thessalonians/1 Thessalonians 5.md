### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Thessalonians|Next Entry]]

*The Saints will know the season of the Second Coming of Christ—Live the way Saints should live—Rejoice evermore—Do not despise prophesyings.*

**1**  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. ^verse-1

**2**  For yourselves know perfectly that the [[#^note-2a|day]] of the Lord so cometh as a [[#^note-2b|thief]] in the night. ^verse-2

**3**  For when they shall say, Peace and [[#^note-3a|safety]]; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not [[#^note-3b|escape]]. ^verse-3

**4**  But ye, brethren, are not in [[#^note-4a|darkness]], that that [[#^note-4b|day]] should overtake you as a thief. ^verse-4

**5**  Ye are all the [[#^note-5a|children]] of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore let us not [[#^note-6a|sleep]], as do others; but let us [[#^note-6b|watch]] and be [[#^note-6c|sober]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. ^verse-7

**8**  But let us, who are of the day, be [[#^note-8a|sober]], putting on the [[#^note-8b|breastplate]] of [[#^note-8c|faith]] and love; and for an helmet, the [[#^note-8d|hope]] of salvation. ^verse-8

**9**  For God hath not appointed us to [[#^note-9a|wrath]], but to obtain [[#^note-9b|salvation]] by our Lord Jesus Christ, ^verse-9

**10**  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should [[#^note-10a|live]] together with him. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore [[#^note-11a|comfort]] yourselves together, and [[#^note-11b|edify]] one another, even as also ye do. ^verse-11

**12**  And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which [[#^note-12a|labour]] among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; ^verse-12

**13**  And to [[#^note-13a|esteem]] them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at [[#^note-13b|peace]] among yourselves. ^verse-13

**14**  Now we exhort you, brethren, [[#^note-14a|warn]] them that are [[#^note-14b|unruly]], [[#^note-14c|comfort]] the [[#^note-14d|feebleminded]], [[#^note-14e|support]] the [[#^note-14f|weak]], be patient toward all men. ^verse-14

**15**  See that none [[#^note-15a|render]] [[#^note-15b|evil]] for evil unto any [[#^note-15c|man]]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Rejoice]] evermore. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Pray]] without ceasing. ^verse-17

**18**  In every thing give [[#^note-18a|thanks]]: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Quench]] not the [[#^note-19b|Spirit]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Despise not prophesyings. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Prove]] all things; hold fast that which is good. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Abstain]] from all [[#^note-22b|appearance]] of [[#^note-22c|evil]]. ^verse-22

**23**  And the very God of peace [[#^note-23a|sanctify]] you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-23

**24**  Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. ^verse-24

**25**  Brethren, pray for us. ^verse-25

**26**  Greet all the brethren with an holy [[#^note-26a|kiss]]. ^verse-26

**27**  I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. ^verse-27

**28**  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. ^verse-28
