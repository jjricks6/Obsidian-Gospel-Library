[[New Testament/1 Thessalonians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 2|Next Entry]]

*The gospel comes both in word and in power.*

**1**  Paul, and [[#^note-1a|Silvanus]], and [[#^note-1b|Timotheus]], [[#^note-1c|unto]] the [[#^note-1d|church]] of the [[#^note-1e|Thessalonians]] which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-1

**2**  We give [[#^note-2a|thanks]] to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; ^verse-2

**3**  Remembering without ceasing your work of [[#^note-3a|faith]], and [[#^note-3b|labour]] of love, and [[#^note-3c|patience]] of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; ^verse-3

**4**  Knowing, brethren [[#^note-4a|beloved]], your [[#^note-4b|election]] of God. ^verse-4

**5**  For our [[#^note-5a|gospel]] [[#^note-5b|came]] not unto you in [[#^note-5c|word]] only, but also in [[#^note-5d|power]], and in the [[#^note-5e|Holy Ghost]], and in much assurance; as ye know what [[#^note-5f|manner]] of men we were among you for your sake. ^verse-5

**6**  And ye became [[#^note-6a|followers]] of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much [[#^note-6b|affliction]], with [[#^note-6c|joy]] of the Holy Ghost: ^verse-6

**7**  So that ye were [[#^note-7a|ensamples]] to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. ^verse-7

**8**  For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every [[#^note-8a|place]] your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. ^verse-8

**9**  For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from [[#^note-9a|idols]] to serve the [[#^note-9b|living]] and true God; ^verse-9

**10**  And to wait for his Son from [[#^note-10a|heaven]], whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which [[#^note-10b|delivered]] us from the [[#^note-10c|wrath]] to come. ^verse-10
