### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Thessalonians/1 Thessalonians 5|Next Entry]]

*The Saints are told to be holy, sanctify themselves, and love one anotherâ€”The Lord will come, and the dead will rise.*

**1**  Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have [[#^note-1a|received]] of us how ye ought to [[#^note-1b|walk]] and to [[#^note-1c|please]] God, so ye would [[#^note-1d|abound]] more and more. ^verse-1

**2**  For ye know what commandments [[#^note-2a|we]] gave you by the Lord Jesus. ^verse-2

**3**  For this is the will of God, even your [[#^note-3a|sanctification]], that ye should [[#^note-3b|abstain]] from [[#^note-3c|fornication]]: ^verse-3

**4**  That every one of you should know how to possess his [[#^note-4a|vessel]] in [[#^note-4b|sanctification]] and honour; ^verse-4

**5**  Not in the [[#^note-5a|lust of concupiscence]], even as the [[#^note-5b|Gentiles]] which [[#^note-5c|know not]] God: ^verse-5

**6**  That no man [[#^note-6a|go beyond and defraud]] his brother in [[#^note-6b|any matter]]: because that the Lord is the [[#^note-6c|avenger]] of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. ^verse-6

**7**  For God hath not called us unto [[#^note-7a|uncleanness]], but unto holiness. ^verse-7

**8**  He therefore that [[#^note-8a|despiseth]], [[#^note-8b|despiseth]] not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his [[#^note-8c|holy Spirit]]. ^verse-8

**9**  But as touching [[#^note-9a|brotherly love]] ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are [[#^note-9b|taught]] of God to [[#^note-9c|love]] one another. ^verse-9

**10**  And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; ^verse-10

**11**  And that ye [[#^note-11a|study]] to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to [[#^note-11b|work]] with your own [[#^note-11c|hands]], as we commanded you; ^verse-11

**12**  That ye may walk [[#^note-12a|honestly]] toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing. ^verse-12

**13**  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye [[#^note-13a|sorrow]] not, even as others which have no [[#^note-13b|hope]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which [[#^note-14a|sleep]] in Jesus will God bring with him. ^verse-14

**15**  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, [[#^note-15a|that]] [[#^note-15b|we]] which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not [[#^note-15c|prevent]] them which are asleep. ^verse-15

**16**  For the Lord himself shall [[#^note-16a|descend]] from heaven with [[#^note-16b|a shout]], with the voice of the [[#^note-16c|archangel]], and with the [[#^note-16d|trump]] of God: and the dead in Christ shall [[#^note-16e|rise]] first: ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Then]] we which are alive and remain shall be [[#^note-17b|caught up]] together with them in the clouds, to meet the [[#^note-17c|Lord]] in the [[#^note-17d|air]]: and so shall we [[#^note-17e|ever]] be with the [[#^note-17f|Lord]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Wherefore comfort one another with these words. ^verse-18
