### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/1 John/1 John 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 John|Next Entry]]

*Saints are born of God through belief in Christ—Water, blood, and the Spirit testify of Christ—Belief in Christ is required in order to gain eternal life.*

**1**  Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. ^verse-1

**2**  By this we know that we [[#^note-2a|love]] the [[#^note-2b|children]] of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. ^verse-2

**3**  For this is the [[#^note-3a|love]] of God, that we [[#^note-3b|keep]] his commandments: and his commandments are not [[#^note-3c|grievous]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For whatsoever is [[#^note-4a|born of God]] [[#^note-4b|overcometh]] the world: and this is the [[#^note-4c|victory]] that overcometh the world, even our faith. ^verse-4

**5**  Who is he that [[#^note-5a|overcometh]] the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? ^verse-5

**6**  This is he that [[#^note-6a|came]] by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the [[#^note-6b|Spirit]] that beareth [[#^note-6c|witness]], because the Spirit is truth. ^verse-6

**7**  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the [[#^note-7a|Father]], the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are [[#^note-7b|one]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the [[#^note-8a|Spirit]], and the water, and the [[#^note-8b|blood]]: and these three agree in one. ^verse-8

**9**  If we receive the [[#^note-9a|witness]] of men, the [[#^note-9b|witness]] of God is greater: for this is the [[#^note-9c|witness]] of God which he hath testified of his Son. ^verse-9

**10**  He that [[#^note-10a|believeth]] on the Son of God hath the [[#^note-10b|witness]] in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the [[#^note-10c|record]] that God gave of his Son. ^verse-10

**11**  And this is the record, that God hath given to us [[#^note-11a|eternal life]], and this [[#^note-11b|life]] is in his Son. ^verse-11

**12**  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. ^verse-12

**13**  These things have I [[#^note-13a|written]] unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal [[#^note-13b|life]], and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. ^verse-13

**14**  And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his [[#^note-14a|will]], he [[#^note-14b|heareth]] us: ^verse-14

**15**  And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we [[#^note-15a|ask]], we know that we have the petitions that we [[#^note-15b|desired]] of him. ^verse-15

**16**  If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. ^verse-16

**17**  All unrighteousness is [[#^note-17a|sin]]: and there is a [[#^note-17b|sin]] not unto death. ^verse-17

**18**  We know that whosoever is [[#^note-18a|born of God]] [[#^note-18b|sinneth]] not; but he that is begotten of God [[#^note-18c|keepeth]] himself, and that [[#^note-18d|wicked one]] toucheth him not. ^verse-18

**19**  And we know that we are of [[#^note-19a|God]], and the whole [[#^note-19b|world]] lieth in [[#^note-19c|wickedness]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and [[#^note-20a|eternal life]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. ^verse-21
