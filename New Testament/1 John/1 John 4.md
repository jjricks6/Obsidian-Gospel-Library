[[New Testament/1 John/1 John 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 5|Next Entry]]

*Try the spirits—God is love and dwells in those who love Him.*

**1**  Beloved, believe not every [[#^note-1a|spirit]], but [[#^note-1b|try]] the [[#^note-1c|spirits]] whether they are of God: because many [[#^note-1d|false prophets]] are gone out into the world. ^verse-1

**2**  Hereby [[#^note-2a|know]] ye the [[#^note-2b|Spirit]] of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the [[#^note-2c|flesh]] is of God: ^verse-2

**3**  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is [[#^note-3a|not of God]]: and this is that spirit of [[#^note-3b|antichrist]], whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. ^verse-3

**4**  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. ^verse-4

**5**  They are of the [[#^note-5a|world]]: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. ^verse-5

**6**  We are of God: he that knoweth God [[#^note-6a|heareth]] us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby [[#^note-6b|know]] we the [[#^note-6c|spirit]] of truth, and the spirit of [[#^note-6d|error]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Be[[#^note-7a|love]]d, let us [[#^note-7b|love]] one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is [[#^note-7c|born of God]], and knoweth God. ^verse-7

**8**  He that loveth not [[#^note-8a|knoweth]] not God; for God is love. ^verse-8

**9**  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might [[#^note-9a|live]] through him. ^verse-9

**10**  Herein is love, not that we [[#^note-10a|loved]] God, but that he loved us, and [[#^note-10b|sent]] his Son to be the [[#^note-10c|propitiation]] for our sins. ^verse-10

**11**  Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|No]] man hath [[#^note-12b|seen]] [[#^note-12c|God]] at any time. If we love one another, God [[#^note-12d|dwelleth]] in us, and his love is perfected in us. ^verse-12

**13**  Hereby know we that we [[#^note-13a|dwell]] in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. ^verse-13

**14**  And we have seen and do [[#^note-14a|testify]] that the Father [[#^note-14b|sent]] the Son to be the [[#^note-14c|Saviour]] of the [[#^note-14d|world]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Whosoever shall [[#^note-15a|confess]] that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. ^verse-15

**16**  And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that [[#^note-16a|dwelleth]] in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. ^verse-16

**17**  Herein [[#^note-17a|is]] our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. ^verse-17

**18**  There is no [[#^note-18a|fear]] in [[#^note-18b|love]]; but perfect [[#^note-18c|love]] casteth out fear: because fear hath [[#^note-18d|torment]]. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. ^verse-18

**19**  We [[#^note-19a|love]] him, because he first loved us. ^verse-19

**20**  If a man say, I love God, and [[#^note-20a|hateth]] his [[#^note-20b|brother]], he is a [[#^note-20c|liar]]: for he that loveth not his [[#^note-20d|brother]] whom he hath [[#^note-20e|seen]], how can he love God whom he hath not seen? ^verse-20

**21**  And this commandment have we from him, That he who [[#^note-21a|loveth]] God love his brother also. ^verse-21
