### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/1 John/1 John 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 4|Next Entry]]

*The sons of God will become like Christ—Love for others is required to gain eternal life—Obedience ensures us an answer to our prayers.*

**1**  Behold, what manner of [[#^note-1a|love]] the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the [[#^note-1b|sons]] of God: therefore the [[#^note-1c|world]] knoweth us not, because it knew him not. ^verse-1

**2**  Beloved, now are we the [[#^note-2a|sons]] of God, and it doth not yet [[#^note-2b|appear]] what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be [[#^note-2c|like]] him; for we shall [[#^note-2d|see]] him as he is. ^verse-2

**3**  And every man that hath this [[#^note-3a|hope]] in him [[#^note-3b|purifieth]] himself, even as he is [[#^note-3c|pure]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Whosoever committeth sin [[#^note-4a|transgresseth]] also the law: for [[#^note-4b|sin]] is the transgression of the law. ^verse-4

**5**  And ye know that he was manifested to take away our [[#^note-5a|sins]]; and in him is no sin. ^verse-5

**6**  Whosoever abideth in him [[#^note-6a|sinneth]] not: [[#^note-6b|whosoever]] sinneth hath not seen him, neither [[#^note-6c|known]] him. ^verse-6

**7**  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. ^verse-7

**8**  He that [[#^note-8a|committeth]] [[#^note-8b|sin]] is of the devil; for the devil [[#^note-8c|sinneth]] from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the [[#^note-8d|devil]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Whosoever is [[#^note-9a|born of God]] [[#^note-9b|doth]] not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. ^verse-9

**10**  In this the children of God are [[#^note-10a|manifest]], and the [[#^note-10b|children]] of the devil: whosoever doeth not [[#^note-10c|righteousness]] is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. ^verse-10

**11**  For this is the [[#^note-11a|message]] that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. ^verse-11

**12**  Not as [[#^note-12a|Cain]], who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. ^verse-12

**13**  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. ^verse-13

**14**  We know that we have passed from death unto [[#^note-14a|life]], because we love the [[#^note-14b|brethren]]. He that [[#^note-14c|loveth]] not his brother abideth in [[#^note-14d|death]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Whosoever [[#^note-15a|hateth]] his brother is a [[#^note-15b|murderer]]: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. ^verse-15

**16**  Hereby perceive we the [[#^note-16a|love]] of [[#^note-16b|God]], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. ^verse-16

**17**  But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his [[#^note-17a|brother]] have [[#^note-17b|need]], and [[#^note-17c|shutteth]] up his bowels of [[#^note-17d|compassion]] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? ^verse-17

**18**  My little children, let us not love in word, [[#^note-18a|neither in tongue]]; but in [[#^note-18b|deed]] and in truth. ^verse-18

**19**  And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. ^verse-19

**20**  For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and [[#^note-20a|knoweth]] all things. ^verse-20

**21**  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we [[#^note-21a|confidence]] toward God. ^verse-21

**22**  And whatsoever we [[#^note-22a|ask]], we receive of him, because we [[#^note-22b|keep]] his [[#^note-22c|commandments]], and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. ^verse-22

**23**  And this is his [[#^note-23a|commandment]], That we should [[#^note-23b|believe]] on the [[#^note-23c|name]] of his Son Jesus Christ, and [[#^note-23d|love]] one another, as he gave us commandment. ^verse-23

**24**  And he that keepeth his commandments [[#^note-24a|dwelleth]] in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he [[#^note-24b|abideth]] in us, by the [[#^note-24c|Spirit]] which he hath given us. ^verse-24
