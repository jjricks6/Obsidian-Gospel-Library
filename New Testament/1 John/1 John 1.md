### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/1 John|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 John/1 John 2|Next Entry]]

*The Saints gain fellowship with God by obedienceâ€”We must confess our sins to gain forgiveness.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|That]] which was from the [[#^note-1b|beginning]], which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the [[#^note-1c|Word of life]]; ^verse-1

**2**  (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and [[#^note-2a|shew]] unto you that [[#^note-2b|eternal life]], which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) ^verse-2

**3**  That which we have [[#^note-3a|seen]] and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have [[#^note-3b|fellowship]] with us: and truly our fellowship is with the [[#^note-3c|Father]], and with his Son Jesus Christ. ^verse-3

**4**  And these things [[#^note-4a|write]] we unto you, that your joy may be full. ^verse-4

**5**  This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is [[#^note-5a|light]], and in him is no [[#^note-5b|darkness]] at all. ^verse-5

**6**  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and [[#^note-6a|walk]] in [[#^note-6b|darkness]], we lie, and do not the truth: ^verse-6

**7**  But if we [[#^note-7a|walk]] in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the [[#^note-7b|blood]] of Jesus Christ his Son [[#^note-7c|cleanseth]] us from all sin. ^verse-7

**8**  If we say that we have [[#^note-8a|no]] [[#^note-8b|sin]], we [[#^note-8c|deceive]] ourselves, and the truth is not in us. ^verse-8

**9**  If we [[#^note-9a|confess]] our sins, he is faithful and [[#^note-9b|just]] to [[#^note-9c|forgive]] us our sins, and to [[#^note-9d|cleanse]] us from all unrighteousness. ^verse-9

**10**  If we say that we have [[#^note-10a|not sinned]], we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. ^verse-10
