*Christ is our Advocate with the Father—We know God by obedience—Love not the world—Anti-Christs will come in the last days.*

**1**  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. [[#^note-1a|And]] if any man sin, we have an [[#^note-1b|advocate]] with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: ^verse-1

**2**  And he is the [[#^note-2a|propitiation]] for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole [[#^note-2b|world]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And hereby we do know that we know him, if we [[#^note-3a|keep]] his commandments. ^verse-3

**4**  He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his [[#^note-4a|commandments]], is a [[#^note-4b|liar]], and the truth is not in him. ^verse-4

**5**  But whoso [[#^note-5a|keepeth]] his word, [[#^note-5b|in him]] verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. ^verse-5

**6**  He that saith he [[#^note-6a|abideth]] in him ought himself also so to [[#^note-6b|walk]], even as he walked. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Brethren]], I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. ^verse-7

**8**  Again, a new commandment I write unto you, [[#^note-8a|which]] thing is true in him and in you: because the [[#^note-8b|darkness]] is [[#^note-8c|past]], and the true [[#^note-8d|light]] now shineth. ^verse-8

**9**  He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. ^verse-9

**10**  He that [[#^note-10a|loveth]] his [[#^note-10b|brother]] abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. ^verse-10

**11**  But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and [[#^note-11a|walketh]] in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. ^verse-11

**12**  I [[#^note-12a|write]] unto you, little [[#^note-12b|children]], because your sins are [[#^note-12c|for]]given you for his [[#^note-12d|name's]] sake. ^verse-12

**13**  I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. ^verse-13

**14**  I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. ^verse-14

**15**  Love not the [[#^note-15a|world]], neither the things that are in the [[#^note-15b|world]]. If any man [[#^note-15c|love]] the world, the love of the Father is not in him. ^verse-15

**16**  For all that is in the world, the [[#^note-16a|lust]] of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the [[#^note-16b|pride]] of life, is not of the Father, but is of the [[#^note-16c|world]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And the [[#^note-17a|world]] [[#^note-17b|passeth]] away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the [[#^note-17c|will]] of God [[#^note-17d|abideth]] for ever. ^verse-17

**18**  Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that [[#^note-18a|antichrist]] shall come, even now are there many [[#^note-18b|antichrists]]; whereby we know that it is the last time. ^verse-18

**19**  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. ^verse-19

**20**  But ye have an [[#^note-20a|unction]] from the [[#^note-20b|Holy One]], and ye know all things. ^verse-20

**21**  I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. ^verse-21

**22**  Who is a [[#^note-22a|liar]] but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is [[#^note-22b|antichrist]], that denieth the Father and the Son. ^verse-22

**23**  Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that [[#^note-23a|acknowledgeth]] the Son hath the Father also. ^verse-23

**24**  Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the [[#^note-24a|beginning]]. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. ^verse-24

**25**  And this is the [[#^note-25a|promise]] that he hath promised us, even [[#^note-25b|eternal life]]. ^verse-25

**26**  These things have I written unto you concerning them that [[#^note-26a|seduce]] you. ^verse-26

**27**  But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man [[#^note-27a|teach]] you: but as the same [[#^note-27b|anointing]] [[#^note-27c|teacheth]] you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. ^verse-27

**28**  And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. ^verse-28

**29**  If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth [[#^note-29a|righteousness]] is [[#^note-29b|born]] of him. ^verse-29
