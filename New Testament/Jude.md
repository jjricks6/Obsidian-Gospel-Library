# The General Epistle of Jude

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/3 John|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation|Next Entry]]

*Contend for the faith—Some angels kept not their first estate—Michael disputed about the body of Moses—Enoch prophesied of the Second Coming—Mockers will come in the last days.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Jude]], the [[#^note-1b|servant]] of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called: ^verse-1

**2**  Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. ^verse-2

**3**  Beloved, when I gave all diligence to [[#^note-3a|write]] unto you of the common [[#^note-3b|salvation]], it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should [[#^note-3c|earnestly]] [[#^note-3d|contend]] for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. ^verse-3

**4**  For there are certain [[#^note-4a|men]] crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, [[#^note-4b|ungodly]] men, turning the grace of our God into [[#^note-4c|lasciviousness]], and [[#^note-4d|denying]] the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-4

**5**  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having [[#^note-5a|saved]] the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward [[#^note-5b|destroyed]] them that [[#^note-5c|believed not]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And the [[#^note-6a|angels]] which kept not their [[#^note-6b|first]] [[#^note-6c|estate]], but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the [[#^note-6d|judgment]] of the great day. ^verse-6

**7**  Even as [[#^note-7a|Sodom]] and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to [[#^note-7b|fornication]], and going after [[#^note-7c|strange flesh]], are set forth for an [[#^note-7d|example]], suffering the [[#^note-7e|vengeance]] of eternal fire. ^verse-7

**8**  Likewise also these [[#^note-8a|filthy]] dreamers [[#^note-8b|defile]] the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. ^verse-8

**9**  Yet [[#^note-9a|Michael]] the [[#^note-9b|archangel]], when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of [[#^note-9c|Moses]], durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. ^verse-9

**10**  But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. ^verse-10

**11**  Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of [[#^note-11a|Cain]], and ran greedily after the error of [[#^note-11b|Balaam]] for reward, and [[#^note-11c|perished]] in the gainsaying of Core. ^verse-11

**12**  These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: [[#^note-12a|clouds]] they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; ^verse-12

**13**  Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering [[#^note-13a|stars]], to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. ^verse-13

**14**  And [[#^note-14a|Enoch]] also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord [[#^note-14b|cometh]] with ten thousands of his [[#^note-14c|saints]], ^verse-14

**15**  To [[#^note-15a|execute]] [[#^note-15b|judgment]] upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard [[#^note-15c|speeches]] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. ^verse-15

**16**  These are [[#^note-16a|murmurers]], complainers, walking after their own [[#^note-16b|lusts]]; and their mouth [[#^note-16c|speaketh]] great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of [[#^note-16d|advantage]]. ^verse-16

**17**  But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; ^verse-17

**18**  How that they told you there should be [[#^note-18a|mockers]] in the [[#^note-18b|last time]], who should [[#^note-18c|walk]] after their own ungodly lusts. ^verse-18

**19**  These be they who [[#^note-19a|separate]] themselves, sensual, having not the [[#^note-19b|Spirit]]. ^verse-19

**20**  But ye, beloved, [[#^note-20a|building]] up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, ^verse-20

**21**  Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. ^verse-21

**22**  And of some have [[#^note-22a|compassion]], making a difference: ^verse-22

**23**  And others save with fear, pulling them out of the [[#^note-23a|fire]]; hating even the [[#^note-23b|garment]] spotted by the flesh. ^verse-23

**24**  Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you [[#^note-24a|faultless]] before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, ^verse-24

**25**  To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. ^verse-25
