*God pours out plagues upon the wicked—The nations assemble for Armageddon—Christ comes, islands flee, and mountains cease.*

**1**  And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. ^verse-1

**2**  And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a [[#^note-2a|noisome]] and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. ^verse-2

**3**  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea. ^verse-3

**4**  And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. ^verse-4

**5**  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast [[#^note-5a|judged]] thus. ^verse-5

**6**  For they have [[#^note-6a|shed]] the [[#^note-6b|blood]] of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are [[#^note-6c|worthy]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. ^verse-7

**8**  And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. ^verse-8

**9**  And men were scorched with great heat, and [[#^note-9a|blasphemed]] the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. ^verse-9

**10**  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of [[#^note-10a|darkness]]; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, ^verse-10

**11**  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their [[#^note-11a|pains]] and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. ^verse-11

**12**  And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. ^verse-12

**13**  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the [[#^note-13a|false prophet]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For they are the [[#^note-14a|spirits]] of [[#^note-14b|devils]], working [[#^note-14c|miracles]], which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the [[#^note-14d|battle]] of that great day of God Almighty. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, I come as a [[#^note-15a|thief]]. Blessed is he that [[#^note-15b|watcheth]], and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. ^verse-15

**16**  And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue [[#^note-16a|Armageddon]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. ^verse-17

**18**  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great [[#^note-18a|earthquake]], such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. ^verse-18

**19**  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great [[#^note-19a|Babylon]] came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his [[#^note-19b|wrath]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And every island fled away, and the [[#^note-20a|mountains]] were not found. ^verse-20

**21**  And there fell upon men a great [[#^note-21a|hail]] out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. ^verse-21
