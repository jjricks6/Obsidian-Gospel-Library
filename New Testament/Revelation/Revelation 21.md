[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 22|Next Entry]]

*Those who overcome will be sons of Godâ€”The earth attains its celestial glory.*

**1**  And I saw a [[#^note-1a|new]] [[#^note-1b|heaven]] and a new [[#^note-1c|earth]]: for the first heaven and the first [[#^note-1d|earth]] were passed away; and there was no more sea. ^verse-1

**2**  And I John saw the holy city, [[#^note-2a|new]] [[#^note-2b|Jerusalem]], coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a [[#^note-2c|bride]] adorned for her husband. ^verse-2

**3**  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will [[#^note-3a|dwell]] with them, and they shall be his people, and [[#^note-3b|God]] himself shall be with them, and be their God. ^verse-3

**4**  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more [[#^note-4a|death]], neither [[#^note-4b|sorrow]], nor crying, neither shall there be any more [[#^note-4c|pain]]: for the former things are passed away. ^verse-4

**5**  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things [[#^note-5a|new]]. And he said unto me, [[#^note-5b|Write]]: for these [[#^note-5c|words]] are true and faithful. ^verse-5

**6**  And he said unto me, It is done. [[#^note-6a|I am]] [[#^note-6b|Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the [[#^note-6c|water of life]] freely. ^verse-6

**7**  He that [[#^note-7a|overcometh]] shall [[#^note-7b|inherit]] [[#^note-7c|all]] things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my [[#^note-7d|son]]. ^verse-7

**8**  But the fearful, and [[#^note-8a|unbelieving]], and the abominable, and [[#^note-8b|murderers]], and [[#^note-8c|whoremongers]], and [[#^note-8d|sorcerers]], and idolaters, and all [[#^note-8e|liars]], shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the [[#^note-8f|second]] [[#^note-8g|death]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last [[#^note-9a|plagues]], and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. ^verse-9

**10**  And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high [[#^note-10a|mountain]], and shewed me that great city, the holy [[#^note-10b|Jerusalem]], descending out of heaven from God, ^verse-10

**11**  Having the [[#^note-11a|glory]] of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; ^verse-11

**12**  And had a wall great and high, and had twelve [[#^note-12a|gates]], and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: ^verse-12

**13**  On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. ^verse-13

**14**  And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. ^verse-14

**15**  And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. ^verse-15

**16**  And the city lieth foursquare, and the [[#^note-16a|length]] is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand [[#^note-16b|furlongs]]. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. ^verse-16

**17**  And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. ^verse-17

**18**  And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. ^verse-18

**19**  And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; ^verse-19

**20**  The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. ^verse-20

**21**  And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure [[#^note-21a|gold]], as it were transparent [[#^note-21b|glass]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God [[#^note-22a|Almighty]] and the Lamb are the [[#^note-22b|temple]] of it. ^verse-22

**23**  And the city had no need of the [[#^note-23a|sun]], neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the [[#^note-23b|Lamb]] is the [[#^note-23c|light]] thereof. ^verse-23

**24**  And the nations of them which are saved shall [[#^note-24a|walk]] in the light of it: and the [[#^note-24b|kings]] of the [[#^note-24c|earth]] do bring their glory and honour into it. ^verse-24

**25**  And the [[#^note-25a|gates]] of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. ^verse-25

**26**  And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. ^verse-26

**27**  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that [[#^note-27a|defileth]], neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's [[#^note-27b|book of life]]. ^verse-27
