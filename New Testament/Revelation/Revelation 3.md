[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 4|Next Entry]]

*He who overcomes will retain his name in the book of life, reach godhood, and be with Jesus as He is with the Father.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] unto the [[#^note-1b|angel]] of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven [[#^note-1c|Spirits]] of God, and the seven [[#^note-1d|stars]]; I [[#^note-1e|know]] thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art [[#^note-1f|dead]]. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Be]] watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. ^verse-2

**3**  Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not [[#^note-3a|watch]], I will come on thee as a [[#^note-3b|thief]], and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not [[#^note-4a|defiled]] their garments; and they shall [[#^note-4b|walk]] with me in [[#^note-4c|white]]: for they are [[#^note-4d|worthy]]. ^verse-4

**5**  He that [[#^note-5a|overcometh]], the same shall be clothed in [[#^note-5b|white]] [[#^note-5c|raiment]]; and I will not [[#^note-5d|blot out]] his name out of the [[#^note-5e|book of life]], but I will [[#^note-5f|confess]] his name before my Father, and before his angels. ^verse-5

**6**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. ^verse-6

**7**  And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the [[#^note-7a|key]] of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; ^verse-7

**8**  I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and [[#^note-9a|worship]] before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. ^verse-9

**10**  Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will [[#^note-10a|keep]] thee from the hour of [[#^note-10b|temptation]], which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, I come [[#^note-11a|quickly]]: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. ^verse-11

**12**  Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the [[#^note-12a|name]] of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is [[#^note-12b|new Jerusalem]], which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. ^verse-12

**13**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. ^verse-13

**14**  And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the [[#^note-14a|faithful]] and true witness, the [[#^note-14b|beginning]] of the [[#^note-14c|creation]] of God; ^verse-14

**15**  I know thy [[#^note-15a|works]], that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. ^verse-15

**16**  So then because thou art [[#^note-16a|lukewarm]], and neither cold nor hot, I will [[#^note-16b|spue]] thee out of my mouth. ^verse-16

**17**  Because thou sayest, I am [[#^note-17a|rich]], and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: ^verse-17

**18**  I [[#^note-18a|counsel]] thee to buy of me [[#^note-18b|gold]] tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. ^verse-18

**19**  As many as I love, I rebuke and [[#^note-19a|chasten]]: be zealous therefore, and repent. ^verse-19

**20**    Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and [[#^note-20a|open]] the door, I will [[#^note-20b|come]] in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. ^verse-20

**21**  To him that [[#^note-21a|overcometh]] will I grant to [[#^note-21b|sit]] with me in my [[#^note-21c|throne]], even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. ^verse-21

**22**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. ^verse-22
