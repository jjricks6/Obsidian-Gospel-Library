### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Revelation|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 2|Next Entry]]

*Christ chooses some as kings and priests unto God—Christ will come again—John sees the risen Lord.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|The]] [[#^note-1b|Revelation]] of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his [[#^note-1c|servants]] things which must [[#^note-1d|shortly]] come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his [[#^note-1e|angel]] unto his servant John: ^verse-1

**2**  Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Blessed]] is he that [[#^note-3b|readeth]], and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the [[#^note-3c|time]] is at hand. ^verse-3

**4**  John to the [[#^note-4a|seven]] churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which [[#^note-4b|is]], and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven [[#^note-4c|Spirits]] which are before his throne; ^verse-4

**5**  And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the [[#^note-5a|first]] begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and [[#^note-5b|washed]] us from our sins in his own [[#^note-5c|blood]], ^verse-5

**6**  And hath made us [[#^note-6a|kings]] and [[#^note-6b|priests]] unto God and his Father; to him be [[#^note-6c|glory]] and [[#^note-6d|dominion]] for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, he [[#^note-7a|cometh]] with clouds; and every eye shall [[#^note-7b|see]] him, and they also which pierced him: and all [[#^note-7c|kindreds]] of the earth shall [[#^note-7d|wail]] because of him. Even so, Amen. ^verse-7

**8**  I am [[#^note-8a|Alpha and Omega]], the [[#^note-8b|beginning]] and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the [[#^note-8c|Almighty]]. ^verse-8

**9**  I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and [[#^note-9a|patience]] of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. ^verse-9

**10**  I was in the Spirit on the [[#^note-10a|Lord's]] [[#^note-10b|day]], and heard behind me a great [[#^note-10c|voice]], as of a trumpet, ^verse-10

**11**  Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the [[#^note-11a|first]] and the last: and, What thou seest, [[#^note-11b|write]] in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto [[#^note-11c|Thyatira]], and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto [[#^note-11d|Laodicea]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden [[#^note-12a|candlesticks]]; ^verse-12

**13**  And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the [[#^note-13a|Son of man]], [[#^note-13b|clothed]] with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. ^verse-13

**14**  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his [[#^note-14a|eyes]] were as a flame of [[#^note-14b|fire]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his [[#^note-15a|voice]] as the sound of many waters. ^verse-15

**16**  And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged [[#^note-16a|sword]]: and his [[#^note-16b|countenance]] was as the [[#^note-16c|sun]] shineth in his strength. ^verse-16

**17**  And when I [[#^note-17a|saw]] him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: ^verse-17

**18**  I am he that [[#^note-18a|liveth]], and was [[#^note-18b|dead]]; and, behold, I am alive for [[#^note-18c|evermore]], Amen; and have the [[#^note-18d|keys]] of [[#^note-18e|hell]] and of death. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Write]] the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; ^verse-19

**20**  The mystery of the seven [[#^note-20a|stars]] which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the [[#^note-20b|angels]] of the seven churches: and the seven [[#^note-20c|candlesticks]] which thou sawest are the seven churches. ^verse-20
