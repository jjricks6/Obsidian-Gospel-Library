### Chapter 22

[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 21|Previous Entry]]

*The Saints will reign in celestial splendor—Christ will come, and men will be judged—Blessed are they who keep His commandments.*

**1**  And he shewed me a pure river of [[#^note-1a|water of life]], clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. ^verse-1

**2**  In the midst of the s[[#^note-2a|tree]]t of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of [[#^note-2b|life]], which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the [[#^note-2c|leaves]] of the tree were for the healing of the nations. ^verse-2

**3**  And there shall be no more [[#^note-3a|curse]]: but the [[#^note-3b|throne]] of God and of the [[#^note-3c|Lamb]] shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall [[#^note-4a|see]] his [[#^note-4b|face]]; and his [[#^note-4c|name]] shall be in their foreheads. ^verse-4

**5**  And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the [[#^note-5a|sun]]; for the Lord God giveth them [[#^note-5b|light]]: and they shall [[#^note-5c|reign]] [[#^note-5d|for ever]] and ever. ^verse-5

**6**  And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and [[#^note-6a|true]]: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must [[#^note-6b|shortly]] be done. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, I [[#^note-7a|come]] quickly: [[#^note-7b|blessed]] is he that keepeth the [[#^note-7c|sayings]] of the prophecy of this book. ^verse-7

**8**  And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I [[#^note-8a|fell down]] to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. ^verse-8

**9**  Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God. ^verse-9

**10**  And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. ^verse-10

**11**  He that is [[#^note-11a|unjust]], let him be [[#^note-11b|unjust]] still: and he which is [[#^note-11c|filthy]], let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. ^verse-11

**12**  And, behold, I [[#^note-12a|come]] quickly; and my [[#^note-12b|reward]] is with me, to give every man according as his [[#^note-12c|work]] shall be. ^verse-12

**13**  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the [[#^note-13a|first]] and the last. ^verse-13

**14**  Blessed are they that [[#^note-14a|do]] his [[#^note-14b|commandments]], that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. ^verse-14

**15**  For without are dogs, and [[#^note-15a|sorcerers]], and [[#^note-15b|whoremongers]], and [[#^note-15c|murderers]], and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a [[#^note-15d|lie]]. ^verse-15

**16**  I Jesus have sent mine [[#^note-16a|angel]] to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the [[#^note-16b|root]] and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning [[#^note-16c|star]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And the Spirit and the bride say, [[#^note-17a|Come]]. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the [[#^note-17b|water of life]] freely. ^verse-17

**18**  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall [[#^note-18a|add]] unto these things, God shall add unto him the [[#^note-18b|plagues]] that are written in this book: ^verse-18

**19**  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the [[#^note-19a|book of life]], and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. ^verse-19

**20**  He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I [[#^note-20a|come]] quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. ^verse-20

**21**  The [[#^note-21a|grace]] of our [[#^note-21b|Lord Jesus Christ]] be with you all. Amen. ^verse-21
