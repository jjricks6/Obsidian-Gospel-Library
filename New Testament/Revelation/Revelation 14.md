*The Lamb will stand upon Mount Zion—The gospel will be restored in the last days by angelic ministry—The Son of Man will harvest the earth.*

**1**  And I looked, and, lo, a [[#^note-1a|Lamb]] stood on the mount [[#^note-1b|Sion]], and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's [[#^note-1c|name]] written in their foreheads. ^verse-1

**2**  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: ^verse-2

**3**  And they sung as it were a new [[#^note-3a|song]] before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. ^verse-3

**4**  These are they which were not defiled with [[#^note-4a|women]]; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were [[#^note-4b|redeemed]] from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. ^verse-4

**5**  And in their mouth was found no [[#^note-5a|guile]]: for they are without fault before the throne of God. ^verse-5

**6**  And I saw another [[#^note-6a|angel]] fly in the midst of heaven, having the [[#^note-6b|everlasting]] [[#^note-6c|gospel]] to [[#^note-6d|preach]] unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every [[#^note-6e|nation]], and kindred, and tongue, and people, ^verse-6

**7**  Saying with a loud voice, [[#^note-7a|Fear]] God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his [[#^note-7b|judgment]] is come: and [[#^note-7c|worship]] [[#^note-7d|him]] that made [[#^note-7e|heaven]], and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. ^verse-7

**8**  And there followed another angel, saying, [[#^note-8a|Babylon]] is [[#^note-8b|fallen]], is fallen, that great [[#^note-8c|city]], because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her [[#^note-8d|fornication]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, ^verse-9

**10**  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is [[#^note-10a|poured]] out without mixture into the cup of his [[#^note-10b|indignation]]; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: ^verse-10

**11**  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. ^verse-11

**12**  Here is the [[#^note-12a|patience]] of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. ^verse-12

**13**  And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, [[#^note-13a|Blessed]] are the [[#^note-13b|dead]] which [[#^note-13c|die]] in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may [[#^note-13d|rest]] from their labours; and their works do follow them. ^verse-13

**14**  And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the [[#^note-14a|Son of man]], having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. ^verse-14

**15**  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, [[#^note-15a|Thrust]] in thy sickle, and [[#^note-15b|reap]]: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the [[#^note-15c|harvest]] of the earth is [[#^note-15d|ripe]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. ^verse-16

**17**  And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. ^verse-17

**18**  And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the [[#^note-18a|vine]] of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. ^verse-18

**19**  And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great [[#^note-19a|winepress]] of the wrath of God. ^verse-19

**20**  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. ^verse-20
