*John also sees in the sixth seal the Restoration of the gospel, the sealing of the 144,000, and the hosts of the exalted from all nations.*

**1**  And after these things I saw four [[#^note-1a|angels]] standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four [[#^note-1b|winds]] of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. ^verse-1

**2**  And I saw another angel [[#^note-2a|ascending]] from the east, having the [[#^note-2b|seal]] of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, ^verse-2

**3**  Saying, [[#^note-3a|Hurt]] not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have [[#^note-3b|sealed]] the [[#^note-3c|servants]] of our God in their foreheads. ^verse-3

**4**  And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an [[#^note-4a|hundred]] and forty and four thousand of all the [[#^note-4b|tribes]] of the children of [[#^note-4c|Israel]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Of the tribe of [[#^note-5a|Juda]] were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of [[#^note-5b|Reuben]] were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. ^verse-5

**6**  Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. ^verse-6

**7**  Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. ^verse-7

**8**  Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of [[#^note-8a|Joseph]] were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. ^verse-8

**9**  After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and [[#^note-9a|kindreds]], and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and [[#^note-9b|palms]] in their hands; ^verse-9

**10**  And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. ^verse-10

**11**  And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four [[#^note-11a|beasts]], and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, ^verse-11

**12**  Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-12

**13**  And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? ^verse-13

**14**  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came [[#^note-14a|out]] of great [[#^note-14b|tribulation]], and have [[#^note-14c|washed]] their robes, and made them [[#^note-14d|white]] in the [[#^note-14e|blood]] of the [[#^note-14f|Lamb]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his [[#^note-15a|temple]]: and he that [[#^note-15b|sitteth]] on the throne shall [[#^note-15c|dwell]] among them. ^verse-15

**16**  They shall hunger no more, neither [[#^note-16a|thirst]] any more; neither shall the [[#^note-16b|sun]] light on them, nor any heat. ^verse-16

**17**  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of [[#^note-17a|waters]]: and God shall wipe away all [[#^note-17b|tears]] from their eyes. ^verse-17
