*John sees fire and desolation poured out during the seventh seal and preceding the Second Coming.*

**1**  And when he had [[#^note-1a|opened]] the [[#^note-1b|seventh seal]], there was [[#^note-1c|silence]] in heaven about the space of half an hour. ^verse-1

**2**  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven [[#^note-2a|trumpets]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much [[#^note-3a|incense]], that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. ^verse-3

**4**  And the smoke of the incense, which came with the [[#^note-4a|prayers]] of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. ^verse-4

**5**  And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and [[#^note-5a|cast]] it into the earth: and there were [[#^note-5b|voices]], and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. ^verse-5

**6**  And the seven angels which had the seven [[#^note-6a|trumpets]] prepared themselves to sound. ^verse-6

**7**  The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and [[#^note-7a|fire]] mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. ^verse-7

**8**  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became [[#^note-8a|blood]]; ^verse-8

**9**  And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. ^verse-9

**10**  And the third angel sounded, and there [[#^note-10a|fell]] a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; ^verse-10

**11**  And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. ^verse-11

**12**  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. ^verse-12

**13**  And I beheld, and heard an [[#^note-13a|angel]] flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, [[#^note-13b|Woe]], woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! ^verse-13
