[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 7|Next Entry]]

*Christ opens the six seals, and John sees the events thereinâ€”In the fifth seal, he sees the Christian martyrs; and in the sixth, he sees the signs of the times.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] I saw when the Lamb opened one of the [[#^note-1b|seals]], and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four [[#^note-1c|beasts]] saying, Come and see. ^verse-1

**2**  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. ^verse-2

**3**  And when he had opened the [[#^note-3a|second]] seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. ^verse-3

**4**  And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take [[#^note-4a|peace]] from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. ^verse-4

**5**  And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. ^verse-5

**6**  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. ^verse-6

**7**  And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. ^verse-7

**8**  And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with [[#^note-8a|sword]], and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. ^verse-8

**9**  And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the [[#^note-9a|altar]] the souls of them that were [[#^note-9b|slain]] for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: ^verse-9

**10**  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and [[#^note-10a|avenge]] our blood on them that dwell on the earth? ^verse-10

**11**  And [[#^note-11a|white]] [[#^note-11b|robes]] were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should [[#^note-11c|rest]] yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. ^verse-11

**12**  And I beheld when he had opened the [[#^note-12a|sixth seal]], and, lo, there was a great [[#^note-12b|earthquake]]; and the [[#^note-12c|sun]] became [[#^note-12d|black]] as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as [[#^note-12e|blood]]; ^verse-12

**13**  And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her [[#^note-13a|untimely figs]], when she is shaken of a mighty wind. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|And]] the heaven departed as a [[#^note-14b|scroll]] when it is rolled together; and every [[#^note-14c|mountain]] and island were moved out of their places. ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|kings]] of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the [[#^note-15b|dens]] and in the rocks of the mountains; ^verse-15

**16**  And said to the [[#^note-16a|mountains]] and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: ^verse-16

**17**  For the great [[#^note-17a|day]] of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to [[#^note-17b|stand]]? ^verse-17
