[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 18|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 20|Next Entry]]

*The marriage supper of the Lamb is made ready—The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy—Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.*

**1**  And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: ^verse-1

**2**  For true and righteous are his [[#^note-2a|judgments]]: for he hath [[#^note-2b|judged]] the great [[#^note-2c|whore]], which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. ^verse-2

**3**  And again they said, Alleluia. And her [[#^note-3a|smoke]] rose up for ever and ever. ^verse-3

**4**  And the four and twenty elders and the four [[#^note-4a|beasts]] fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. ^verse-4

**5**  And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. ^verse-5

**6**  And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord [[#^note-6a|God]] [[#^note-6b|omnipotent]] reigneth. ^verse-6

**7**  Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the [[#^note-7a|marriage]] of the [[#^note-7b|Lamb]] is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. ^verse-7

**8**  And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine [[#^note-8a|linen]], clean and white: for the fine linen is the [[#^note-8b|righteousness]] of saints. ^verse-8

**9**  And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the [[#^note-9a|marriage]] [[#^note-9b|supper]] of the [[#^note-9c|Lamb]]. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. ^verse-9

**10**  And I [[#^note-10a|fell]] at his feet to [[#^note-10b|worship]] him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy [[#^note-10c|fellowservant]], and of thy brethren that have the [[#^note-10d|testimony]] of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of [[#^note-10e|prophecy]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth [[#^note-11a|judge]] and make [[#^note-11b|war]]. ^verse-11

**12**  His [[#^note-12a|eyes]] were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a [[#^note-12b|name]] written, that no man knew, but he himself. ^verse-12

**13**  And he was [[#^note-13a|clothed]] with a vesture dipped in blood: and his [[#^note-13b|name]] is called The [[#^note-13c|Word of God]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, [[#^note-14a|clothed]] in fine linen, white and clean. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|And]] out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall [[#^note-15b|rule]] them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the [[#^note-15c|winepress]] of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. ^verse-15

**16**  And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, [[#^note-16a|King of Kings]], and [[#^note-16b|Lord]] of Lords. ^verse-16

**17**  And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; ^verse-17

**18**  That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty [[#^note-18a|men]], and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. ^verse-18

**19**  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. ^verse-19

**20**  And the beast was taken, and with him the [[#^note-20a|false prophet]] that wrought [[#^note-20b|miracles]] before him, with which he [[#^note-20c|deceived]] them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a [[#^note-20d|lake]] of [[#^note-20e|fire]] burning with brimstone. ^verse-20

**21**  And the remnant were slain [[#^note-21a|with]] the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. ^verse-21
