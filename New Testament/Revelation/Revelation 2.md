[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 3|Next Entry]]

*He who overcomes will gain eternal life, avoid the second death, inherit the celestial kingdom, and rule many kingdoms.*

**1**  Unto the [[#^note-1a|angel]] of the church of Ephesus [[#^note-1b|write]]; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; ^verse-1

**2**  I [[#^note-2a|know]] thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are [[#^note-2b|apostles]], and are not, and hast found them liars: ^verse-2

**3**  And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. ^verse-3

**4**  Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first [[#^note-4a|love]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy [[#^note-5a|candlestick]] out of his place, except thou [[#^note-5b|repent]]. ^verse-5

**6**  But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the [[#^note-6a|Nicolaitans]], which I also hate. ^verse-6

**7**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the [[#^note-7a|Spirit]] saith unto the churches; To him that [[#^note-7b|overcometh]] will I give to eat of the [[#^note-7c|tree of life]], which is in the midst of the [[#^note-7d|paradise]] of God. ^verse-7

**8**  And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; ^verse-8

**9**  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the [[#^note-9a|blasphemy]] of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. ^verse-9

**10**  Fear none of those things which thou shalt [[#^note-10a|suffer]]: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be [[#^note-10b|tried]]; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto [[#^note-10c|death]], and I will [[#^note-10d|give]] thee a [[#^note-10e|crown]] of life. ^verse-10

**11**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second [[#^note-11a|death]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp [[#^note-12a|sword]] with two edges; ^verse-12

**13**  I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful [[#^note-13a|martyr]], who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. ^verse-13

**14**  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of [[#^note-14a|Balaam]], who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit [[#^note-14b|fornication]]. ^verse-14

**15**  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. ^verse-15

**16**  Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. ^verse-16

**17**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that [[#^note-17a|overcometh]] will I give to eat of the hidden [[#^note-17b|manna]], and will give him a [[#^note-17c|white]] [[#^note-17d|stone]], and in the stone a new [[#^note-17e|name]] written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. ^verse-17

**18**  And unto the [[#^note-18a|angel]] of the church in [[#^note-18b|Thyatira]] write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his [[#^note-18c|eyes]] like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; ^verse-18

**19**  I know thy works, and charity, and [[#^note-19a|service]], and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. ^verse-19

**20**  Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. ^verse-20

**21**  And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, I will cast her [[#^note-22a|into]] a bed, and them that commit [[#^note-22b|adultery]] with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. ^verse-22

**23**  And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which [[#^note-23a|searcheth]] the [[#^note-23b|reins and hearts]]: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. ^verse-23

**24**  But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. ^verse-24

**25**  But that which ye have already [[#^note-25a|hold]] fast till I come. ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|And]] he that [[#^note-26b|overcometh]], and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give [[#^note-26c|power]] over the nations: ^verse-26

**27**  And he shall rule them with a [[#^note-27a|rod of iron]]; as the [[#^note-27b|vessels]] of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. ^verse-27

**28**  And I will give him the morning [[#^note-28a|star]]. ^verse-28

**29**  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. ^verse-29
