[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 6|Next Entry]]

*John sees the book sealed with seven seals, and he sees those people redeemed out of every nationâ€”He hears every creature praising God and the Lamb.*

**1**  And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book [[#^note-1a|written]] within and on the backside, [[#^note-1b|sealed]] with seven [[#^note-1c|seals]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is [[#^note-2a|worthy]] to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? ^verse-2

**3**  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. ^verse-3

**4**  And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. ^verse-4

**5**  And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the [[#^note-5a|Lion]] of the tribe of [[#^note-5b|Juda]], the [[#^note-5c|Root]] of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. ^verse-5

**6**  And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a [[#^note-6a|Lamb]] as it had been slain, [[#^note-6b|having]] seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. ^verse-7

**8**  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of [[#^note-8a|odours]], which are the [[#^note-8b|prayers]] of saints. ^verse-8

**9**  And they [[#^note-9a|sung]] a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast [[#^note-9b|redeemed]] us to God by thy blood out of every [[#^note-9c|kindred]], and tongue, and people, and nation; ^verse-9

**10**  And hast made us unto our God kings and [[#^note-10a|priests]]: and we shall reign on the earth. ^verse-10

**11**  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and [[#^note-11a|thousands]] of thousands; ^verse-11

**12**  Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the [[#^note-12a|Lamb]] that was slain to receive [[#^note-12b|power]], and riches, and [[#^note-12c|wisdom]], and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. ^verse-12

**13**  And every [[#^note-13a|creature]] which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and [[#^note-13b|power]], be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. ^verse-13

**14**  And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever. ^verse-14
