*John is shown that Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations, has become established throughout the earth.*

**1**  And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the [[#^note-1a|judgment]] of the great [[#^note-1b|whore]] that sitteth upon many [[#^note-1c|waters]]: ^verse-1

**2**  With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the [[#^note-2a|inhabitants]] of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her [[#^note-2b|fornication]]. ^verse-2

**3**  So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of [[#^note-3a|names]] of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. ^verse-3

**4**  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand [[#^note-4a|full]] of abominations and [[#^note-4b|filthiness]] of her fornication: ^verse-4

**5**  And upon her forehead was a name written, [[#^note-5a|Mystery]], [[#^note-5b|Babylon]] the Great, the [[#^note-5c|Mother]] of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth. ^verse-5

**6**  And I saw the woman drunken with the [[#^note-6a|blood]] of the saints, and with the blood of the [[#^note-6b|martyrs]] of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great [[#^note-6c|admiration]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. ^verse-7

**8**  The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into [[#^note-8a|perdition]]: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the [[#^note-8b|book of life]] from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. ^verse-8

**9**  And here is the [[#^note-9a|mind]] which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. ^verse-9

**10**  And there are seven [[#^note-10a|kings]]: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. ^verse-10

**11**  And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. ^verse-11

**12**  And the ten [[#^note-12a|horns]] which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. ^verse-12

**13**  These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. ^verse-13

**14**  These shall make [[#^note-14a|war]] with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is [[#^note-14b|Lord of lords]], and [[#^note-14c|King]] of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. ^verse-14

**15**  And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. ^verse-15

**16**  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the [[#^note-16a|whore]], and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and [[#^note-16b|burn]] her with fire. ^verse-16

**17**  For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and [[#^note-17a|give]] their kingdom unto the beast, until the [[#^note-17b|words]] of God shall be fulfilled. ^verse-17

**18**  And the woman which thou sawest is that great [[#^note-18a|city]], which reigneth over the kings of the earth. ^verse-18
