[[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 19|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Revelation/Revelation 21|Next Entry]]

*Satan is bound during the Millennium—The Saints will then live and reign with Christ—The dead stand before God and are judged out of the books according to their works.*

**1**  And I saw an [[#^note-1a|angel]] come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless [[#^note-1b|pit]] and a great chain in his hand. ^verse-1

**2**  And he laid hold on the dragon, that old [[#^note-2a|serpent]], which is the [[#^note-2b|Devil]], and Satan, and [[#^note-2c|bound]] him a thousand years, ^verse-2

**3**  And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the [[#^note-3a|nations]] no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be [[#^note-3b|loosed]] a little season. ^verse-3

**4**  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and [[#^note-4a|judgment]] was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and [[#^note-4b|reigned]] with Christ a [[#^note-4c|thousand]] years. ^verse-4

**5**  But the rest of the [[#^note-5a|dead]] lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Blessed]] and holy is he that hath part in the [[#^note-6b|first]] [[#^note-6c|resurrection]]: on such the [[#^note-6d|second death]] hath no power, but they shall be [[#^note-6e|priests]] of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. ^verse-6

**7**  And when the [[#^note-7a|thousand]] years are expired, [[#^note-7b|Satan]] shall be loosed out of his prison, ^verse-7

**8**  And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, [[#^note-8a|Gog]] and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. ^verse-8

**9**  And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. ^verse-9

**10**  And the [[#^note-10a|devil]] that deceived them was [[#^note-10b|cast]] into the lake of [[#^note-10c|fire]] and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. ^verse-10

**11**  And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the [[#^note-11a|earth]] and the heaven fled away; and there was found no [[#^note-11b|place]] for them. ^verse-11

**12**  And I saw the [[#^note-12a|dead]], small and great, [[#^note-12b|stand]] before God; and the [[#^note-12c|books]] were opened: and another book was opened, which is the [[#^note-12d|book of life]]: and the dead were [[#^note-12e|judged]] out of those things which were written in the books, according to their [[#^note-12f|works]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and [[#^note-13a|death]] and [[#^note-13b|hell]] delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. ^verse-13

**14**  And [[#^note-14a|death]] and [[#^note-14b|hell]] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the [[#^note-14c|second death]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. ^verse-15
