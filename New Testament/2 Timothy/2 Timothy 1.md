### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/2 Timothy|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 2|Next Entry]]

*Christ brings immortality and eternal life through the gospelâ€”Be strong in the faith.*

**1**  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the [[#^note-1a|promise]] of life which is in Christ Jesus, ^verse-1

**2**  To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure [[#^note-3a|conscience]], that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; ^verse-3

**4**  Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; ^verse-4

**5**  When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother [[#^note-5a|Eunice]]; and I am persuaded that in thee also. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou [[#^note-6a|stir up]] the [[#^note-6b|gift]] of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my [[#^note-6c|hands]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For God hath not given us the spirit of [[#^note-7a|fear]]; but of [[#^note-7b|power]], and of [[#^note-7c|love]], and of a sound mind. ^verse-7

**8**  Be not thou therefore [[#^note-8a|ashamed]] of the [[#^note-8b|testimony]] of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; ^verse-8

**9**  Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy [[#^note-9a|calling]], not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and [[#^note-9b|grace]], which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, ^verse-9

**10**  But is now made [[#^note-10a|manifest]] by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished [[#^note-10b|death]], and hath brought [[#^note-10c|life]] and [[#^note-10d|immortality]] to light through the gospel: ^verse-10

**11**  Whereunto I am [[#^note-11a|appointed]] a preacher, and an [[#^note-11b|apostle]], and a teacher of the Gentiles. ^verse-11

**12**  For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not [[#^note-12a|ashamed]]: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. ^verse-12

**13**  Hold fast the [[#^note-13a|form]] of [[#^note-13b|sound]] words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. ^verse-13

**14**  That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which [[#^note-14a|dwelleth]] in us. ^verse-14

**15**  This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be [[#^note-15a|turned away]] from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. ^verse-15

**16**  The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft [[#^note-16a|refreshed]] me, and was not ashamed of my chain: ^verse-16

**17**  But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. ^verse-17

**18**  The Lord grant unto him that he may find [[#^note-18a|mercy]] of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. ^verse-18
