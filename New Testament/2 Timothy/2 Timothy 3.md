*Paul describes the apostasy and perilous times of the last days—The scriptures guide man to salvation.*

**1**  This know also, that in the [[#^note-1a|last days]] perilous [[#^note-1b|times]] shall come. ^verse-1

**2**  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, [[#^note-2a|covetous]], boasters, [[#^note-2b|proud]], blasphemers, [[#^note-2c|disobedient]] to parents, [[#^note-2d|unthankful]], unholy, ^verse-2

**3**  Without [[#^note-3a|natural]] [[#^note-3b|affection]], [[#^note-3c|trucebreakers]], [[#^note-3d|false accusers]], [[#^note-3e|incontinent]], fierce, despisers of those that are good, ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Traitors]], [[#^note-4b|heady]], [[#^note-4c|highminded]], lovers of [[#^note-4d|pleasures]] more than lovers of God; ^verse-4

**5**  Having a [[#^note-5a|form]] of godliness, but [[#^note-5b|denying]] the power thereof: from such turn away. ^verse-5

**6**  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly [[#^note-6a|women]] laden with sins, led away with divers [[#^note-6b|lusts]], ^verse-6

**7**  Ever [[#^note-7a|learning]], and never able to come to the [[#^note-7b|knowledge]] of the [[#^note-7c|truth]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also [[#^note-8a|resist]] the truth: men of [[#^note-8b|corrupt]] minds, reprobate concerning the faith. ^verse-8

**9**  But they shall proceed no further: for their [[#^note-9a|folly]] shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. ^verse-9

**10**  But thou hast [[#^note-10a|fully known]] my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, ^verse-10

**11**  Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what [[#^note-11a|persecutions]] I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, and all that will live [[#^note-12a|godly]] in Christ Jesus shall [[#^note-12b|suffer]] [[#^note-12c|persecution]]. ^verse-12

**13**  But evil men and [[#^note-13a|seducers]] shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. ^verse-13

**14**  But [[#^note-14a|continue]] thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; ^verse-14

**15**  And that from a [[#^note-15a|child]] thou hast known the holy [[#^note-15b|scriptures]], which are able to make thee [[#^note-15c|wise]] unto [[#^note-15d|salvation]] through faith which is in Christ Jesus. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|All]] [[#^note-16b|scripture]] is given by [[#^note-16c|inspiration]] of God, and is [[#^note-16d|profitable]] for [[#^note-16e|doctrine]], for [[#^note-16f|reproof]], for correction, for [[#^note-16g|instruction]] in [[#^note-16h|righteousness]]: ^verse-16

**17**  That the man of God may be [[#^note-17a|perfect]], throughly furnished unto all [[#^note-17b|good works]]. ^verse-17
