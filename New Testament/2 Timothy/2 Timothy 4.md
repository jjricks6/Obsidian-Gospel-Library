### Chapter 4

[[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Titus|Next Entry]]

*Paul gives a solemn charge to preach the gospel in a day of apostasyâ€”Paul and all Saints are assured of exaltation.*

**1**    I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall [[#^note-1a|judge]] the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Preach]] the word; [[#^note-2b|be]] [[#^note-2c|instant]] in season, out of season; [[#^note-2d|reprove]], rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. ^verse-2

**3**  For the time will come when they will not [[#^note-3a|endure]] sound [[#^note-3b|doctrine]]; but after their own [[#^note-3c|lusts]] shall they heap to themselves [[#^note-3d|teachers]], having itching ears; ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall turn away their ears from the [[#^note-4a|truth]], and shall be turned unto [[#^note-4b|fables]]. ^verse-4

**5**  But [[#^note-5a|watch]] thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an [[#^note-5b|evangelist]], [[#^note-5c|make]] full proof of thy ministry. ^verse-5

**6**  For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. ^verse-6

**7**  I have fought a good [[#^note-7a|fight]], I have [[#^note-7b|finished]] my course, I have kept the faith: ^verse-7

**8**  Henceforth there is laid up for me a [[#^note-8a|crown]] of [[#^note-8b|righteousness]], which the Lord, the righteous [[#^note-8c|judge]], shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. ^verse-8

**9**  Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: ^verse-9

**10**  For [[#^note-10a|Demas]] hath [[#^note-10b|forsaken]] me, having loved this present [[#^note-10c|world]], and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. ^verse-10

**11**  Only [[#^note-11a|Luke]] is with me. Take [[#^note-11b|Mark]], and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. ^verse-11

**12**  And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. ^verse-12

**13**  The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the [[#^note-13a|books]], but especially the parchments. ^verse-13

**14**  Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his [[#^note-14a|works]]: ^verse-14

**15**  Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly [[#^note-15a|withstood]] our words. ^verse-15

**16**  At my first [[#^note-16a|answer]] no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their [[#^note-16b|charge]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Notwithstanding the [[#^note-17a|Lord]] stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. ^verse-17

**18**  And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will [[#^note-18a|preserve]] me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-18

**19**  Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. ^verse-19

**20**  Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. ^verse-20

**21**  Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. ^verse-21

**22**  The [[#^note-22a|Lord Jesus Christ]] be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. ^verse-22
