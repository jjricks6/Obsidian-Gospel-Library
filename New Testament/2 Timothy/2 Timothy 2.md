### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Timothy/2 Timothy 3|Next Entry]]

*Christ gives eternal glory to the elect—Shun contention and seek godliness.*

**1**  Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ^verse-1

**2**  And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to [[#^note-2a|teach]] others also. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou therefore endure [[#^note-3a|hardness]], as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. ^verse-3

**4**  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. ^verse-4

**5**  And if a man also [[#^note-5a|strive]] for [[#^note-5b|masteries]], yet is he not [[#^note-5c|crowned]], except he strive lawfully. ^verse-5

**6**  The husbandman that laboureth must be first [[#^note-6a|partaker]] of the fruits. ^verse-6

**7**  Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. ^verse-7

**8**  Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was [[#^note-8a|raised]] from the dead according to my [[#^note-8b|gospel]]: ^verse-8

**9**  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. ^verse-10

**11**  It is a faithful saying: For if we be [[#^note-11a|dead]] with him, we shall also live with him: ^verse-11

**12**  If we [[#^note-12a|suffer]], we shall also [[#^note-12b|reign]] with him: if we [[#^note-12c|deny]] him, he also will deny us: ^verse-12

**13**  If we [[#^note-13a|believe not]], yet he abideth faithful: he cannot [[#^note-13b|deny]] himself. ^verse-13

**14**  Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they [[#^note-14a|strive not about words]] to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Study]] to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, [[#^note-15b|rightly dividing]] the word of truth. ^verse-15

**16**  But shun profane and [[#^note-16a|vain babblings]]: for they will increase unto more [[#^note-16b|ungodliness]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And their [[#^note-17a|word]] will eat as doth a canker: of whom is [[#^note-17b|Hymenæus]] and Philetus; ^verse-17

**18**  Who concerning the truth have [[#^note-18a|erred]], saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. ^verse-18

**19**  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. ^verse-19

**20**  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of [[#^note-20a|earth]]; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. ^verse-20

**21**  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a [[#^note-21a|vessel]] unto honour, [[#^note-21b|sanctified]], and [[#^note-21c|meet]] for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. ^verse-21

**22**  Flee also youthful [[#^note-22a|lusts]]: but follow [[#^note-22b|righteousness]], faith, charity, [[#^note-22c|peace]], with them that call on the Lord out of a [[#^note-22d|pure]] heart. ^verse-22

**23**  But [[#^note-23a|foolish]] and unlearned [[#^note-23b|questions]] avoid, knowing that they do gender [[#^note-23c|strifes]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And the servant of the Lord must not [[#^note-24a|strive]]; but be gentle unto all men, apt to [[#^note-24b|teach]], patient, ^verse-24

**25**  In [[#^note-25a|meekness]] [[#^note-25b|instructing]] those that oppose themselves; if God [[#^note-25c|peradventure]] will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; ^verse-25

**26**  And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken [[#^note-26a|captive]] by him at his will. ^verse-26
