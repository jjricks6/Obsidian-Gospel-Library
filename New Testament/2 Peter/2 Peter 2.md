### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 3|Next Entry]]

*False teachers among the Saints are damnedâ€”Lustful Saints will perish in their own corruption.*

**1**  But there were [[#^note-1a|false prophets]] also among the people, even as there shall be [[#^note-1b|false]] [[#^note-1c|teachers]] among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that [[#^note-1d|bought]] them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. ^verse-1

**2**  And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of [[#^note-2a|truth]] shall be evil spoken of. ^verse-2

**3**  And through covetousness shall they with [[#^note-3a|feigned]] words make merchandise of you: whose [[#^note-3b|judgment]] now of a long time lingereth not, and their [[#^note-3c|damnation]] slumbereth not. ^verse-3

**4**  For if God spared not the [[#^note-4a|angels]] that sinned, but cast them down to [[#^note-4b|hell]], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto [[#^note-4c|judgment]]; ^verse-4

**5**  And spared not the old world, but saved [[#^note-5a|Noah]] the eighth person, a preacher of [[#^note-5b|righteousness]], bringing in the [[#^note-5c|flood]] upon the world of the ungodly; ^verse-5

**6**  And turning the cities of [[#^note-6a|Sodom]] and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an [[#^note-6b|ensample]] unto those that after should live ungodly; ^verse-6

**7**  And delivered just [[#^note-7a|Lot]], [[#^note-7b|vexed]] with the [[#^note-7c|filthy]] conversation of the wicked: ^verse-7

**8**  (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, [[#^note-8a|vexed]] his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord knoweth how to [[#^note-9a|deliver]] the [[#^note-9b|godly]] out of [[#^note-9c|temptations]], and to [[#^note-9d|reserve]] the unjust unto the day of [[#^note-9e|judgment]] to be punished: ^verse-9

**10**  But chiefly them that [[#^note-10a|walk]] after the flesh in the [[#^note-10b|lust]] of [[#^note-10c|uncleanness]], and despise [[#^note-10d|government]]. [[#^note-10e|Presumptuous]] are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. ^verse-10

**11**  Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. ^verse-11

**12**  But these, as [[#^note-12a|natural]] brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly [[#^note-12b|perish]] in their own corruption; ^verse-12

**13**  And shall receive the [[#^note-13a|reward]] of unrighteousness, as they that count it [[#^note-13b|pleasure]] to [[#^note-13c|riot]] in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; ^verse-13

**14**  Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: ^verse-14

**15**  Which have [[#^note-15a|forsaken]] the right [[#^note-15b|way]], and are gone [[#^note-15c|astray]], following the way of [[#^note-15d|Balaam]] the son of Bosor, who loved the [[#^note-15e|wages]] of unrighteousness; ^verse-15

**16**  But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb [[#^note-16a|ass]] speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. ^verse-16

**17**  These are [[#^note-17a|wells]] without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the [[#^note-17b|mist]] of [[#^note-17c|darkness]] is reserved for ever. ^verse-17

**18**  For when they [[#^note-18a|speak]] great swelling words of [[#^note-18b|vanity]], they [[#^note-18c|allure]] through the [[#^note-18d|lusts]] of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean [[#^note-18e|escaped]] from them who live in error. ^verse-18

**19**  While they promise them [[#^note-19a|liberty]], they themselves are the [[#^note-19b|servants]] of [[#^note-19c|corruption]]: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in [[#^note-19d|bondage]]. ^verse-19

**20**  For if after they have [[#^note-20a|escaped]] the [[#^note-20b|pollutions]] of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are [[#^note-20c|again]] [[#^note-20d|entangled]] therein, and [[#^note-20e|overcome]], the latter end is [[#^note-20f|worse]] with them than the beginning. ^verse-20

**21**  For it had been better for them not to have [[#^note-21a|known]] the way of [[#^note-21b|righteousness]], than, after they have known it, to [[#^note-21c|turn]] from the holy commandment delivered unto them. ^verse-21

**22**  But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own [[#^note-22a|vomit]] again; and the sow that was [[#^note-22b|washed]] to her wallowing in the mire. ^verse-22
