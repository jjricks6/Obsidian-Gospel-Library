### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/2 Peter|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 2|Next Entry]]

*Peter urges the Saints to make their calling and election sureâ€”Prophecy comes by the power of the Holy Ghost.*

**1**  Simon Peter, a [[#^note-1a|servant]] and an [[#^note-1b|apostle]] of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained [[#^note-1c|like precious]] faith with us through the [[#^note-1d|righteousness]] [[#^note-1e|of]] God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: ^verse-1

**2**  Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the [[#^note-2a|knowledge]] of God, and of Jesus our Lord, ^verse-2

**3**  According as his divine power hath given unto us [[#^note-3a|all]] things that pertain unto [[#^note-3b|life]] and [[#^note-3c|godliness]], through the knowledge of him that hath called us [[#^note-3d|to]] glory and [[#^note-3e|virtue]]: ^verse-3

**4**  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious [[#^note-4a|promises]]: that by these ye might be [[#^note-4b|partakers]] of the [[#^note-4c|divine]] [[#^note-4d|nature]], having [[#^note-4e|escaped]] the [[#^note-4f|corruption]] that is in the world through [[#^note-4g|lust]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And beside this, giving all [[#^note-5a|diligence]], add to your faith [[#^note-5b|virtue]]; and to virtue [[#^note-5c|knowledge]]; ^verse-5

**6**  And to knowledge [[#^note-6a|temperance]]; and to temperance [[#^note-6b|patience]]; and to patience [[#^note-6c|godliness]]; ^verse-6

**7**  And to godliness [[#^note-7a|brotherly]] [[#^note-7b|kindness]]; and to brotherly kindness [[#^note-7c|charity]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For if these things be in you, and [[#^note-8a|abound]], they make you that ye shall neither be [[#^note-8b|barren]] nor [[#^note-8c|unfruitful]] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-8

**9**  But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and [[#^note-10a|election]] sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never [[#^note-10b|fall]]: ^verse-10

**11**  For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the [[#^note-11a|everlasting]] [[#^note-11b|kingdom]] of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. ^verse-12

**13**  Yea, I think it [[#^note-13a|meet]], as long as I am in this [[#^note-13b|tabernacle]], to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; ^verse-13

**14**  Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath [[#^note-14a|shewed]] me. ^verse-14

**15**  Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. ^verse-15

**16**  For we have not followed cunningly devised [[#^note-16a|fables]], when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were [[#^note-16b|eyewitnesses]] of his majesty. ^verse-16

**17**  For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my [[#^note-17a|beloved Son]], in whom I am well pleased. ^verse-17

**18**  And this [[#^note-18a|voice]] which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy [[#^note-18b|mount]]. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|We]] have also a more [[#^note-19b|sure]] word of [[#^note-19c|prophecy]]; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day [[#^note-19d|star]] arise in your hearts: ^verse-19

**20**  K[[#^note-20a|no]]wing this first, that no [[#^note-20b|prophecy]] of the [[#^note-20c|scripture]] is of any private [[#^note-20d|interpretation]]. ^verse-20

**21**  For the [[#^note-21a|prophecy]] came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God [[#^note-21b|spake]] as they were [[#^note-21c|moved]] by the [[#^note-21d|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-21
