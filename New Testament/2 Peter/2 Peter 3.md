### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/2 Peter/2 Peter 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 John|Next Entry]]

*Some in the latter days will doubt the Second Comingâ€”The elements will melt at the coming of the Lord.*

**1**  This second epistle, beloved, I now [[#^note-1a|write]] unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of [[#^note-1b|remembrance]]: ^verse-1

**2**  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy [[#^note-2a|prophets]], and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Knowing]] this first, that there shall come in the [[#^note-3b|last days]] scoffers, walking after their own [[#^note-3c|lusts]], ^verse-3

**4**  And saying, [[#^note-4a|Where]] is the [[#^note-4b|promise]] of his [[#^note-4c|coming]]? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. ^verse-4

**5**  For this they willingly are [[#^note-5a|ignorant]] of, that by the [[#^note-5b|word]] of God the heavens were of old, and the [[#^note-5c|earth]] standing out of the water and in the water: ^verse-5

**6**  Whereby the world that then was, being [[#^note-6a|overflowed]] with [[#^note-6b|water]], perished: ^verse-6

**7**  But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto [[#^note-7a|fire]] against the day of judgment and [[#^note-7b|perdition]] of ungodly men. ^verse-7

**8**  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand [[#^note-8a|years]], and a thousand years as one day. ^verse-8

**9**  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is [[#^note-9a|longsuffering]] to us-ward, not willing that any should [[#^note-9b|perish]], but that all should come to [[#^note-9c|repentance]]. ^verse-9

**10**  But the [[#^note-10a|day]] of the Lord will [[#^note-10b|come]] as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall [[#^note-10c|pass away]] with a great noise, and the [[#^note-10d|elements]] shall melt with fervent heat, the [[#^note-10e|earth]] also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. ^verse-10

**11**  Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what [[#^note-11a|manner]] of persons ought ye to be in all holy [[#^note-11b|conversation]] and godliness, ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Looking]] for and [[#^note-12b|hasting]] unto the [[#^note-12c|coming]] of the [[#^note-12d|day]] of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? ^verse-12

**13**  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new [[#^note-13a|heavens]] and a [[#^note-13b|new]] [[#^note-13c|earth]], wherein dwelleth [[#^note-13d|righteousness]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be [[#^note-14a|diligent]] that ye may be found of him in peace, without [[#^note-14b|spot]], and blameless. ^verse-14

**15**  And [[#^note-15a|account]] that the [[#^note-15b|longsuffering]] of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; ^verse-15

**16**  As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable [[#^note-16a|wrest]], as they do also the other [[#^note-16b|scriptures]], unto their own destruction. ^verse-16

**17**  Ye therefore, beloved, [[#^note-17a|seeing]] ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being [[#^note-17b|led]] [[#^note-17c|away]] with the error of the wicked, fall from your own [[#^note-17d|steadfastness]]. ^verse-17

**18**  But grow in [[#^note-18a|grace]], and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. ^verse-18
