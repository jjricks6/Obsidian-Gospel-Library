*John the Baptist is beheaded—Jesus feeds the five thousand and walks on the sea—Those who touch the hem of His garment are made whole.*

**1**  At that time [[#^note-1a|Herod]] the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, ^verse-1

**2**  And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. ^verse-3

**4**  For John said unto him, It is not [[#^note-4a|lawful]] for thee to have her. ^verse-4

**5**  And [[#^note-5a|when]] he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a [[#^note-5b|prophet]]. ^verse-5

**6**  But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. ^verse-6

**7**  Whereupon he [[#^note-7a|promised]] with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. ^verse-7

**8**  And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a [[#^note-8a|charger]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. ^verse-9

**10**  And he sent, and [[#^note-10a|beheaded]] John in the prison. ^verse-10

**11**  And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. ^verse-11

**12**  And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. ^verse-13

**14**  And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with [[#^note-14a|compassion]] toward them, and he healed their [[#^note-14b|sick]]. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves [[#^note-15a|victuals]]. ^verse-15

**16**  But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. ^verse-16

**17**  And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. ^verse-17

**18**  He said, Bring them hither to me. ^verse-18

**19**  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and [[#^note-19a|brake]], and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. ^verse-19

**20**  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they [[#^note-20a|took]] up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. ^verse-20

**21**  And they that had eaten were about [[#^note-21a|five]] thousand men, beside women and children. ^verse-21

**22**    ¶ And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. ^verse-22

**23**  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to [[#^note-23a|pray]]: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. ^verse-23

**24**  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. ^verse-24

**25**    And [[#^note-25a|in]] the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. ^verse-25

**26**  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. ^verse-26

**27**  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good [[#^note-27a|cheer]]; it is I; be not afraid. ^verse-27

**28**  And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. ^verse-28

**29**  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. ^verse-29

**30**  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was [[#^note-30a|afraid]]; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. ^verse-30

**31**  And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little [[#^note-31a|faith]], wherefore didst thou [[#^note-31b|doubt]]? ^verse-31

**32**  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. ^verse-32

**33**  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. ^verse-33

**34**  ¶ And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. ^verse-34

**35**  And when the men of that place [[#^note-35a|had knowledge of him]], they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; ^verse-35

**36**  And besought him that they might only touch the [[#^note-36a|hem]] of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly [[#^note-36b|whole]]. ^verse-36
