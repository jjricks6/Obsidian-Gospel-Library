[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11|Next Entry]]

*Jesus instructs and empowers the Twelve Apostles and sends them forth to preach, minister, and heal the sick—Those who receive the Twelve receive the Lord.*

**1**    And when he had [[#^note-1a|called]] unto him his [[#^note-1b|twelve disciples]], he gave them [[#^note-1c|power against]] [[#^note-1d|unclean spirits]], to cast them out, and to [[#^note-1e|heal]] all manner of [[#^note-1f|sickness]] and all manner of disease. ^verse-1

**2**  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; ^verse-2

**3**  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the [[#^note-3a|publican]]; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus; ^verse-3

**4**  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also [[#^note-4a|betrayed]] him. ^verse-4

**5**  These twelve Jesus [[#^note-5a|sent]] forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the [[#^note-5b|Samaritans]] enter ye not: ^verse-5

**6**  But go rather to the [[#^note-6a|lost]] [[#^note-6b|sheep]] of the house of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven [[#^note-7a|is at hand]]. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Heal]] the sick, cleanse the [[#^note-8b|lepers]], raise the dead, [[#^note-8c|cast out]] devils: [[#^note-8d|freely]] ye have received, freely [[#^note-8e|give]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your [[#^note-9a|purses]], ^verse-9

**10**  Nor [[#^note-10a|scrip]] for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is [[#^note-10b|worthy]] of his [[#^note-10c|meat]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And into whatsoever city or town ye shall [[#^note-11a|enter]], inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. ^verse-11

**12**  And when ye come into an house, salute it. ^verse-12

**13**  And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. ^verse-13

**14**  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the [[#^note-14a|dust]] of your [[#^note-14b|feet]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of [[#^note-15a|Sodom]] and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Behold, I send you forth as [[#^note-16a|sheep]] in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore [[#^note-16b|wise]] as serpents, and [[#^note-16c|harmless]] as doves. ^verse-16

**17**  But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; ^verse-17

**18**  And ye shall be brought before governors and [[#^note-18a|kings]] [[#^note-18b|for my sake]], for a [[#^note-18c|testimony against]] them and the Gentiles. ^verse-18

**19**  But when they deliver you up, [[#^note-19a|take no thought]] how or what ye shall [[#^note-19b|speak]]: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. ^verse-19

**20**  For it is not ye that speak, but the [[#^note-20a|Spirit]] of your Father which speaketh in you. ^verse-20

**21**  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. ^verse-21

**22**  And ye shall be [[#^note-22a|hated]] of all men [[#^note-22b|for]] my [[#^note-22c|name's]] sake: but he that [[#^note-22d|endureth]] to the end shall be saved. ^verse-22

**23**  But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. ^verse-23

**24**  The [[#^note-24a|disciple]] is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. ^verse-24

**25**  It is enough for the disciple [[#^note-25a|that he be]] as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? ^verse-25

**26**  Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing [[#^note-26a|covered]], that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. ^verse-26

**27**  What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. ^verse-27

**28**  And [[#^note-28a|fear not]] them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather [[#^note-28b|fear]] him which is able to [[#^note-28c|destroy]] both [[#^note-28d|soul]] and body in [[#^note-28e|hell]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Are not two [[#^note-29a|sparrows]] sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. ^verse-29

**30**  But the very [[#^note-30a|hairs]] of your head are all numbered. ^verse-30

**31**  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more [[#^note-31a|value]] than many [[#^note-31b|sparrows]]. ^verse-31

**32**  Whosoever therefore shall [[#^note-32a|confess me]] before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. ^verse-32

**33**  But whosoever shall [[#^note-33a|deny]] me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. ^verse-33

**34**  Think not that I am come to send [[#^note-34a|peace]] on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. ^verse-34

**35**  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. ^verse-35

**36**  And a man's [[#^note-36a|foes]] shall be they of his own [[#^note-36b|household]]. ^verse-36

**37**  He that [[#^note-37a|loveth]] father or mother [[#^note-37b|more]] than me is not worthy of me: and he that [[#^note-37c|loveth]] son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. ^verse-37

**38**  And he that taketh not his [[#^note-38a|cross]], and followeth after me, is not [[#^note-38b|worthy]] of me. ^verse-38

**39**  [[#^note-39a|He]] that findeth his life shall [[#^note-39b|lose]] it: and he that [[#^note-39c|loseth]] his [[#^note-39d|life]] for my sake shall find it. ^verse-39

**40**  ¶ He that [[#^note-40a|receiveth]] you [[#^note-40b|receiveth]] me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. ^verse-40

**41**  He that [[#^note-41a|receiveth]] a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's [[#^note-41b|reward]]; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. ^verse-41

**42**  And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the [[#^note-42a|name]] of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise [[#^note-42b|lose]] his reward. ^verse-42
