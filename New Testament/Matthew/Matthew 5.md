[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6|Next Entry]]

*Jesus preaches the Sermon on the Mount—Its teachings replace and transcend some aspects of the law of Moses—All are commanded to be perfect like their Father in Heaven.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: ^verse-1

**2**  And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, ^verse-2

**3**    [[#^note-3a|Blessed]] are the [[#^note-3b|poor in spirit]]: for theirs is the [[#^note-3c|kingdom]] of heaven. ^verse-3

**4**  Blessed are they that [[#^note-4a|mourn]]: for they shall be [[#^note-4b|comforted]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Blessed are the [[#^note-5a|meek]]: for they shall inherit the [[#^note-5b|earth]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Blessed are they which do [[#^note-6a|hunger]] and thirst after [[#^note-6b|righteousness]]: for they shall be filled. ^verse-6

**7**  Blessed are the [[#^note-7a|merciful]]: for they shall obtain mercy. ^verse-7

**8**  Blessed are the [[#^note-8a|pure]] in [[#^note-8b|heart]]: for they shall [[#^note-8c|see]] God. ^verse-8

**9**  Blessed are the [[#^note-9a|peacemakers]]: for they shall be called the [[#^note-9b|children]] of God. ^verse-9

**10**  Blessed are they which are [[#^note-10a|persecuted]] for [[#^note-10b|righteousness']] sake: for [[#^note-10c|theirs]] is the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-10

**11**  Blessed are ye, when men shall [[#^note-11a|revile]] you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of [[#^note-11b|evil]] against you falsely, [[#^note-11c|for my sake]]. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Rejoice]], and be exceeding glad: for great is your [[#^note-12b|reward]] in heaven: for so [[#^note-12c|persecuted]] they the prophets which were before you. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Ye are the [[#^note-13a|salt]] of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. ^verse-13

**14**  Ye are the [[#^note-14a|light]] of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. ^verse-14

**15**  Neither do men light a [[#^note-15a|candle]], and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. ^verse-15

**16**  Let your [[#^note-16a|light]] so shine before men, that they may see your good [[#^note-16b|works]], and [[#^note-16c|glorify]] your Father which is in heaven. ^verse-16

**17**    ¶ Think not that I am come to [[#^note-17a|destroy]] the [[#^note-17b|law]], or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. ^verse-17

**18**  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the [[#^note-18a|law]], till all be [[#^note-18b|fulfilled]]. ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Whosoever]] therefore shall [[#^note-19b|break]] one of these least commandments, and shall [[#^note-19c|teach]] men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and [[#^note-19d|teach]] them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-19

**20**  For I say unto you, That except your [[#^note-20a|righteousness]] shall exceed the righteousness of the [[#^note-20b|scribes]] and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou [[#^note-21a|shalt]] not [[#^note-21b|kill]]; and whosoever shall kill shall be [[#^note-21c|in]] danger of the judgment: ^verse-21

**22**  But I say unto you, That whosoever is [[#^note-22a|angry]] with his brother [[#^note-22b|without a cause]] shall be [[#^note-22c|in]] danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, [[#^note-22d|Raca]], shall be [[#^note-22e|in]] danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. ^verse-22

**23**  Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; ^verse-23

**24**  Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be [[#^note-24a|reconciled]] to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Agree]] with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. ^verse-25

**26**  Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid [[#^note-26a|the uttermost farthing]]. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit [[#^note-27a|adultery]]: ^verse-27

**28**  But I say unto you, That whosoever [[#^note-28a|looketh]] on a [[#^note-28b|woman]] to [[#^note-28c|lust after]] her hath committed [[#^note-28d|adultery]] with her already in his heart. ^verse-28

**29**  And if thy right eye [[#^note-29a|offend thee]], pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into [[#^note-29b|hell]]. ^verse-29

**30**  And if thy right [[#^note-30a|hand]] offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into [[#^note-30b|hell]]. ^verse-30

**31**  It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of [[#^note-31a|divorcement]]: ^verse-31

**32**  But I say unto you, That whosoever shall [[#^note-32a|put away]] his [[#^note-32b|wife]], saving for the cause of [[#^note-32c|fornication]], causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not [[#^note-33a|forswear thyself]], but shalt [[#^note-33b|perform]] unto the Lord thine [[#^note-33c|oaths]]: ^verse-33

**34**  But I say unto you, [[#^note-34a|Swear]] not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's [[#^note-34b|throne]]: ^verse-34

**35**  Nor by the earth; for it is his [[#^note-35a|footstool]]: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the [[#^note-35b|city]] of the great King. ^verse-35

**36**  Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. ^verse-36

**37**  But let your [[#^note-37a|communication]] be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh [[#^note-37b|of evil]]. ^verse-37

**38**  ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, An [[#^note-38a|eye]] for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: ^verse-38

**39**  But I say unto you, That ye resist not [[#^note-39a|evil]]: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right [[#^note-39b|cheek]], [[#^note-39c|turn]] to him the other also. ^verse-39

**40**  And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. ^verse-40

**41**  And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. ^verse-41

**42**  [[#^note-42a|Give]] to him that asketh thee, and from him that would [[#^note-42b|borrow]] of thee turn not thou away. ^verse-42

**43**  ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt [[#^note-43a|love]] thy [[#^note-43b|neighbour]], and hate thine enemy. ^verse-43

**44**  But I say unto you, [[#^note-44a|Love]] your [[#^note-44b|enemies]], [[#^note-44c|bless]] them that [[#^note-44d|curse]] you, do [[#^note-44e|good]] to them that [[#^note-44f|hate]] you, and [[#^note-44g|pray]] for them which despitefully use you, and [[#^note-44h|persecute]] you; ^verse-44

**45**  That ye [[#^note-45a|may be]] the [[#^note-45b|children]] of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth [[#^note-45c|rain]] on the just and on the unjust. ^verse-45

**46**  For if ye [[#^note-46a|love]] them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? ^verse-46

**47**  And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? ^verse-47

**48**  [[#^note-48a|Be]] ye therefore [[#^note-48b|perfect]], even as your [[#^note-48c|Father]] which is in heaven is [[#^note-48d|perfect]]. ^verse-48
