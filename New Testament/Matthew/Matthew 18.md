### Chapter 18

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 19|Next Entry]]

*Jesus explains how we are to treat our offending brethren—The Son of Man came to save that which was lost—All of the Twelve receive the keys of the kingdom—Jesus explains why we should forgive.*

**1**    At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the [[#^note-1a|greatest]] in the kingdom of heaven? ^verse-1

**2**  And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, ^verse-2

**3**  And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little [[#^note-3a|children]], ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-3

**4**  Whosoever therefore shall [[#^note-4a|humble]] himself as this little [[#^note-4b|child]], the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-4

**5**  And whoso shall receive one such little child in my [[#^note-5a|name]] receiveth me. ^verse-5

**6**  But whoso shall [[#^note-6a|offend]] one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ Woe unto the world because of [[#^note-7a|offences]]! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. ^verse-8

**9**  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into [[#^note-9a|hell fire]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Take heed that ye despise not one of these [[#^note-10a|little ones]]; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. ^verse-10

**11**  For the [[#^note-11a|Son of man]] is come to [[#^note-11b|save]] that which was [[#^note-11c|lost]]. ^verse-11

**12**  How think ye? if a man have an hundred [[#^note-12a|sheep]], and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? ^verse-12

**13**  And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. ^verse-13

**14**  Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these [[#^note-14a|little ones]] should [[#^note-14b|perish]]. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Moreover if thy brother shall [[#^note-15a|trespass]] against thee, go and [[#^note-15b|tell]] him his [[#^note-15c|fault]] between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. ^verse-15

**16**  But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three [[#^note-16a|witnesses]] every word may be established. ^verse-16

**17**  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the [[#^note-17a|church]]: but if he [[#^note-17b|neglect]] to hear the [[#^note-17c|church]], let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. ^verse-17

**18**  Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall [[#^note-18a|bind]] on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ^verse-18

**19**  Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall [[#^note-19a|agree]] on earth as [[#^note-19b|touching]] any thing that they shall [[#^note-19c|ask]], it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. ^verse-19

**20**  For where two or three are [[#^note-20a|gathered]] [[#^note-20b|together]] in my [[#^note-20c|name]], there am I in the [[#^note-20d|midst]] of them. ^verse-20

**21**    ¶ Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I [[#^note-21a|forgive]] him? till seven times? ^verse-21

**22**  Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until [[#^note-22a|seventy]] times seven. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would [[#^note-23a|take account of]] his [[#^note-23b|servants]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. ^verse-24

**25**  But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be [[#^note-25a|sold]], and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. ^verse-25

**26**  The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. ^verse-26

**27**  Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. ^verse-27

**28**  But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him [[#^note-28a|an hundred pence]]: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. ^verse-28

**29**  And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. ^verse-29

**30**  And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. ^verse-30

**31**  So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very [[#^note-31a|sorry]], and came and told unto their lord all that was done. ^verse-31

**32**  Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that [[#^note-32a|debt]], because thou desiredst me: ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|Shouldest]] not thou also have had [[#^note-33b|compassion]] on thy fellowservant, even as I had [[#^note-33c|pity]] on thee? ^verse-33

**34**  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. ^verse-34

**35**  So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts [[#^note-35a|forgive]] not every one his brother their trespasses. ^verse-35
