### Chapter 26

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27|Next Entry]]

*Jesus is anointed—He keeps the Passover and institutes the sacrament—He suffers in Gethsemane, is betrayed by Judas, and is taken before Caiaphas—Peter denies that he knows Jesus.*

**1**  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, ^verse-1

**2**  Ye know that after two days is the feast of the [[#^note-2a|passover]], and the Son of man is [[#^note-2b|betrayed]] to be [[#^note-2c|crucified]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called [[#^note-3a|Caiaphas]], ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|consulted]] that they might take Jesus by [[#^note-4b|subtilty]], and [[#^note-4c|kill]] him. ^verse-4

**5**  But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an [[#^note-5a|uproar]] among the people. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, ^verse-6

**7**  There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious [[#^note-7a|ointment]], and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. ^verse-7

**8**  But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this [[#^note-8a|waste]]? ^verse-8

**9**  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. ^verse-9

**10**  When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath [[#^note-10a|wrought]] a good work upon me. ^verse-10

**11**  For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. ^verse-11

**12**  For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it [[#^note-12a|for my burial]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. ^verse-13

**14**    ¶ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, ^verse-14

**15**  And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for [[#^note-15a|thirty]] pieces of silver. ^verse-15

**16**  And from that time he sought opportunity to [[#^note-16a|betray]] him. ^verse-16

**17**    ¶ Now the first day of the feast of [[#^note-17a|unleavened]] bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the [[#^note-17b|passover]]? ^verse-17

**18**  And he said, Go into the city [[#^note-18a|to such a man]], and say unto him, The Master saith, My [[#^note-18b|time]] is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. ^verse-18

**19**  And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the [[#^note-19a|passover]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. ^verse-20

**21**  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. ^verse-21

**22**  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? ^verse-22

**23**  And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. ^verse-23

**24**  The Son of man goeth as it is [[#^note-24a|written]] of him: but woe unto that man by whom the [[#^note-24b|Son of man]] is betrayed! [[#^note-24c|it had been good]] for that man if he had not been [[#^note-24d|born]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. ^verse-25

**26**  ¶ [[#^note-26a|And]] as they were eating, Jesus took [[#^note-26b|bread]], [[#^note-26c|and]] blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my [[#^note-26d|body]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And he took the [[#^note-27a|cup]], and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, [[#^note-27b|Drink]] ye all of it; ^verse-27

**28**  For this is my [[#^note-28a|blood]] of the new [[#^note-28b|testament]], which is shed for many for the [[#^note-28c|remission]] of sins. ^verse-28

**29**  But I say unto you, I will not [[#^note-29a|drink]] henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I [[#^note-29b|drink it]] new with you in my Father's kingdom. ^verse-29

**30**  And when they had sung an [[#^note-30a|hymn]], they went out into the mount of Olives. ^verse-30

**31**  Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be [[#^note-31a|offended]] because of me this night: for it is written, I will [[#^note-31b|smite]] the [[#^note-31c|shepherd]], and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. ^verse-31

**32**  But after I am [[#^note-32a|risen]] again, I will go before you into Galilee. ^verse-32

**33**  Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be [[#^note-33a|offended]] because of thee, yet will I never be offended. ^verse-33

**34**  Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. ^verse-34

**35**  Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. ^verse-35

**36**    ¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called [[#^note-36a|Gethsemane]], and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and [[#^note-36b|pray]] yonder. ^verse-36

**37**  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and [[#^note-37a|began]] to be sorrowful and very heavy. ^verse-37

**38**  Then saith he unto them, My soul is [[#^note-38a|exceeding sorrowful]], even unto death: tarry ye here, and [[#^note-38b|watch]] with me. ^verse-38

**39**  And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and [[#^note-39a|prayed]], saying, O my [[#^note-39b|Father]], if it be possible, let this [[#^note-39c|cup]] pass from me: nevertheless not as I [[#^note-39d|will]], but as [[#^note-39e|thou]] [[#^note-39f|wilt]]. ^verse-39

**40**  And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them [[#^note-40a|asleep]], and saith unto Peter, What, [[#^note-40b|could]] ye not watch with me one hour? ^verse-40

**41**  [[#^note-41a|Watch]] and [[#^note-41b|pray]], that ye enter not into [[#^note-41c|temptation]]: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. ^verse-41

**42**  He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy [[#^note-42a|will be]] done. ^verse-42

**43**  And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. ^verse-43

**44**  And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. ^verse-44

**45**  Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is [[#^note-45a|betrayed]] into the hands of sinners. ^verse-45

**46**  Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. ^verse-46

**47**  ¶ And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. ^verse-47

**48**  Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. ^verse-48

**49**  And [[#^note-49a|forthwith]] he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. ^verse-49

**50**  And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. ^verse-50

**51**  And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a [[#^note-51a|servant]] of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. ^verse-51

**52**  Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall [[#^note-52a|perish]] with the sword. ^verse-52

**53**  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? ^verse-53

**54**  But how then shall the [[#^note-54a|scriptures]] be fulfilled, that thus it must be? ^verse-54

**55**  In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you [[#^note-55a|teaching]] in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. ^verse-55

**56**  But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. ^verse-56

**57**    ¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to [[#^note-57a|Caiaphas]] the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. ^verse-57

**58**  But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. ^verse-58

**59**  Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false [[#^note-59a|witness]] against Jesus, [[#^note-59b|to]] put him to death; ^verse-59

**60**  But found none: yea, though many false [[#^note-60a|witnesses]] came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, ^verse-60

**61**  And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the [[#^note-61a|temple]] of God, and to build it in three days. ^verse-61

**62**  And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? ^verse-62

**63**  But Jesus [[#^note-63a|held]] his [[#^note-63b|peace]]. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I [[#^note-63c|adjure thee]] by the [[#^note-63d|living God]], that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. ^verse-63

**64**  Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the [[#^note-64a|Son of man]] sitting on the right hand of [[#^note-64b|power]], and [[#^note-64c|coming]] in the clouds of heaven. ^verse-64

**65**  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken [[#^note-65a|blasphemy]]; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. ^verse-65

**66**  What think ye? They answered and said, He is [[#^note-66a|guilty]] [[#^note-66b|of]] [[#^note-66c|death]]. ^verse-66

**67**  Then did they [[#^note-67a|spit]] in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, ^verse-67

**68**  Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that [[#^note-68a|smote]] thee? ^verse-68

**69**  ¶ Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a [[#^note-69a|damsel]] came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. ^verse-69

**70**  But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. ^verse-70

**71**  And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. ^verse-71

**72**  And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. ^verse-72

**73**  And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech [[#^note-73a|bewrayeth thee]]. ^verse-73

**74**  Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the [[#^note-74a|cock crew]]. ^verse-74

**75**  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt [[#^note-75a|deny]] me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. ^verse-75
