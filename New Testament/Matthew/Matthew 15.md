### Chapter 15

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 16|Next Entry]]

*The scribes and Pharisees contend against Jesus—He heals the daughter of a gentile woman—He feeds the four thousand.*

**1**  Then came to Jesus [[#^note-1a|scribes]] and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, ^verse-1

**2**  Why do thy disciples transgress the [[#^note-2a|tradition]] of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. ^verse-2

**3**  But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your [[#^note-3a|tradition]]? ^verse-3

**4**  For God commanded, saying, [[#^note-4a|Honour]] thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, [[#^note-4b|let him die]] the death. ^verse-4

**5**  But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a [[#^note-5a|gift]], by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; ^verse-5

**6**  And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. ^verse-6

**7**  Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, ^verse-7

**8**  This people draweth nigh unto me with their [[#^note-8a|mouth]], and [[#^note-8b|honoureth]] me with their lips; but their [[#^note-8c|heart]] is far from me. ^verse-8

**9**  But in vain they do [[#^note-9a|worship]] me, teaching for [[#^note-9b|doctrines]] the [[#^note-9c|commandments]] of men. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: ^verse-10

**11**  Not that which goeth into the mouth [[#^note-11a|defileth]] a man; but that which cometh out of the [[#^note-11b|mouth]], this defileth a man. ^verse-11

**12**  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? ^verse-12

**13**  But he answered and said, Every [[#^note-13a|plant]], which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. ^verse-13

**14**  Let them alone: they be [[#^note-14a|blind]] [[#^note-14b|leaders]] of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. ^verse-14

**15**  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. ^verse-15

**16**  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? ^verse-16

**17**  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? ^verse-17

**18**  But those things which proceed out of the [[#^note-18a|mouth]] come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. ^verse-18

**19**  For out of the [[#^note-19a|heart]] proceed evil thoughts, [[#^note-19b|murders]], [[#^note-19c|adulteries]], [[#^note-19d|fornications]], thefts, [[#^note-19e|false witness]], [[#^note-19f|blasphemies]]: ^verse-19

**20**  These are the things which [[#^note-20a|defile]] a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the [[#^note-21a|coasts]] of Tyre and Sidon. ^verse-21

**22**  And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. ^verse-22

**23**  But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. ^verse-23

**24**  But he answered and said, I am not [[#^note-24a|sent]] but unto the lost sheep of the house of [[#^note-24b|Israel]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. ^verse-25

**26**  But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to [[#^note-26a|dogs]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. ^verse-27

**28**  Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy [[#^note-28a|faith]]: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. ^verse-28

**29**  And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. ^verse-29

**30**  And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: ^verse-30

**31**  Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. ^verse-31

**32**  ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. ^verse-32

**33**  And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? ^verse-33

**34**  And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. ^verse-34

**35**  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. ^verse-35

**36**  And he took the seven [[#^note-36a|loaves]] and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. ^verse-36

**37**  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they [[#^note-37a|took]] up of the [[#^note-37b|broken meat]] that was left seven baskets full. ^verse-37

**38**  And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. ^verse-38

**39**  And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. ^verse-39
