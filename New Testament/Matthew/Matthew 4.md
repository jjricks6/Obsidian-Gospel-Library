[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5|Next Entry]]

*Jesus fasts forty days and is tempted—He begins His ministry, calls disciples, and heals the sick.*

**1**  Then was Jesus [[#^note-1a|led]] up of the Spirit into the wilderness [[#^note-1b|to be]] [[#^note-1c|tempted]] of the devil. ^verse-1

**2**  And when he had [[#^note-2a|fasted]] [[#^note-2b|forty]] days and forty nights, [[#^note-2c|he]] was afterward an hungred. ^verse-2

**3**  And when the [[#^note-3a|tempter]] came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made [[#^note-3b|bread]]. ^verse-3

**4**  But he answered and said, It is written, [[#^note-4a|Man]] shall not [[#^note-4b|live]] by [[#^note-4c|bread]] alone, but by every [[#^note-4d|word]] that proceedeth out of the [[#^note-4e|mouth]] of God. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Then]] the devil taketh him up into the [[#^note-5b|holy city]], and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|And saith]] unto him, [[#^note-6b|If]] thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. ^verse-6

**7**  Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not [[#^note-7a|tempt]] the Lord thy God. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Again]], the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the [[#^note-8b|kingdoms]] of the world, and the glory of them; ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|And saith unto him]], All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. ^verse-9

**10**  Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, [[#^note-10a|Satan]]: for it is written, Thou shalt [[#^note-10b|worship]] the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. ^verse-10

**11**  Then the devil leaveth him, [[#^note-11a|and]], behold, [[#^note-11b|angels]] came and ministered unto him. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into [[#^note-12a|Galilee]]; ^verse-12

**13**  And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: ^verse-13

**14**  That it might be [[#^note-14a|fulfilled]] which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, ^verse-14

**15**  The land of [[#^note-15a|Zabulon]], and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; ^verse-15

**16**  The people which sat in [[#^note-16a|darkness]] saw great [[#^note-16b|light]]; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ From that time Jesus began to [[#^note-17a|preach]], and to say, [[#^note-17b|Repent]]: for the [[#^note-17c|kingdom]] of heaven [[#^note-17d|is at hand]]. ^verse-17

**18**    ¶ And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were [[#^note-18a|fishers]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And he saith unto them, [[#^note-19a|Follow me]], and I will make you [[#^note-19b|fishers of men]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And they straightway left their nets, and [[#^note-20a|followed]] him. ^verse-20

**21**  And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of [[#^note-21a|Zebedee]], and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he [[#^note-21b|called]] them. ^verse-21

**22**  And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And Jesus went about all [[#^note-23a|Galilee]], [[#^note-23b|teaching]] in their synagogues, and [[#^note-23c|preaching]] the gospel of the kingdom, and [[#^note-23d|healing]] all manner of [[#^note-23e|sickness]] and all manner of disease among the [[#^note-23f|people]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with [[#^note-24a|devils]], and those which were lunatic, and those that had the [[#^note-24b|palsy]]; and he [[#^note-24c|healed]] them. ^verse-24

**25**  And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan. ^verse-25
