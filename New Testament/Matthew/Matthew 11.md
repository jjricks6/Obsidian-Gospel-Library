### Chapter 11

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 10|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 12|Next Entry]]

*Jesus acclaims John as more than a prophet—The cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum are rebuked for unbelief—The Son reveals the Father—The yoke of Christ is easy, and His burden is light.*

**1**    And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to [[#^note-1a|preach]] in their cities. ^verse-1

**2**  Now when [[#^note-2a|John]] had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, ^verse-2

**3**  And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? ^verse-3

**4**  Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those [[#^note-4a|things]] which ye do hear and see: ^verse-4

**5**  The [[#^note-5a|blind]] receive their [[#^note-5b|sight]], and the lame walk, the [[#^note-5c|lepers]] are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the [[#^note-5d|poor]] have the gospel preached to them. ^verse-5

**6**  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be [[#^note-6a|offended]] in me. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? ^verse-7

**8**  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in [[#^note-8a|kings']] houses. ^verse-8

**9**  But what went ye out for to see? A [[#^note-9a|prophet]]? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. ^verse-9

**10**  For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my [[#^note-10a|messenger]] before thy face, which shall [[#^note-10b|prepare]] thy way before thee. ^verse-10

**11**  Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of [[#^note-11a|women]] there hath not risen a greater than [[#^note-11b|John the Baptist]]: [[#^note-11c|notwithstanding]] he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ^verse-11

**12**  And from [[#^note-12a|the]] days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|For]] all the [[#^note-13b|prophets]] and the law [[#^note-13c|prophesied]] until John. ^verse-13

**14**  And if ye will receive it, this is [[#^note-14a|Elias]], which was for to come. ^verse-14

**15**  He that hath ears to [[#^note-15a|hear]], let him hear. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, ^verse-16

**17**  And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. ^verse-17

**18**  For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. ^verse-18

**19**  The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and [[#^note-19a|a winebibber]], a friend of [[#^note-19b|publicans]] and sinners. But wisdom is justified [[#^note-19c|of her children]]. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ Then began he to upbraid the [[#^note-20a|cities]] wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: ^verse-20

**21**  Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have [[#^note-21a|repented]] long ago in sackcloth and [[#^note-21b|ashes]]. ^verse-21

**22**  But I say unto you, It shall be more [[#^note-22a|tolerable]] for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. ^verse-22

**23**  And thou, Capernaum, which art [[#^note-23a|exalted]] unto heaven, shalt be brought down to [[#^note-23b|hell]]: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. ^verse-23

**24**  But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of [[#^note-24a|Sodom]] in the day of judgment, than for thee. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ At that time Jesus answered and said, I [[#^note-25a|thank]] thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast [[#^note-25b|hid]] these things from the wise and [[#^note-25c|prudent]], and hast [[#^note-25d|revealed]] them unto [[#^note-25e|babes]]. ^verse-25

**26**  Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. ^verse-26

**27**  All [[#^note-27a|things]] are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man [[#^note-27b|knoweth]] the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, [[#^note-27c|and]] he to whomsoever the Son will [[#^note-27d|reveal]] him. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ [[#^note-28a|Come]] unto me, all ye that [[#^note-28b|labour]] and are heavy laden, and I will give you [[#^note-28c|rest]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Take my [[#^note-29a|yoke]] upon you, and [[#^note-29b|learn]] of me; for I am [[#^note-29c|meek]] and [[#^note-29d|lowly]] in [[#^note-29e|heart]]: and ye shall find [[#^note-29f|rest]] unto your souls. ^verse-29

**30**  For my yoke is [[#^note-30a|easy]], and my burden is light. ^verse-30
