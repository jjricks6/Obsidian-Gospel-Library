*Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John on the mount—Jesus heals a lunatic, tells of His coming death, and pays taxes in a miraculous manner.*

**1**  And after six days Jesus taketh [[#^note-1a|Peter]], James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, ^verse-1

**2**  And was [[#^note-2a|transfigured]] before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. ^verse-2

**3**  And, behold, there appeared unto them [[#^note-3a|Moses]] and [[#^note-3b|Elias]] talking with him. ^verse-3

**4**  Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. ^verse-4

**5**  While he yet spake, behold, a bright [[#^note-5a|cloud]] overshadowed them: and behold a [[#^note-5b|voice]] out of the cloud, which said, This is my [[#^note-5c|beloved]] [[#^note-5d|Son]], in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. ^verse-5

**6**  And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore [[#^note-6a|afraid]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. ^verse-7

**8**  And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. ^verse-8

**9**  And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the [[#^note-9a|vision]] to no [[#^note-9b|man]], until the Son of man be risen again from the [[#^note-9c|dead]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|And]] Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and [[#^note-11b|restore]] all things. ^verse-11

**12**  But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they [[#^note-12a|listed]]. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. ^verse-12

**13**  Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, ^verse-14

**15**  Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he [[#^note-15a|falleth]] into the fire, and oft into the water. ^verse-15

**16**  And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. ^verse-16

**17**  Then Jesus answered and said, O [[#^note-17a|faithless]] and [[#^note-17b|perverse]] generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. ^verse-17

**18**  And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. ^verse-18

**19**  Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? ^verse-19

**20**  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your [[#^note-20a|unbelief]]: for verily I say unto you, If ye have [[#^note-20b|faith]] as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this [[#^note-20c|mountain]], Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be [[#^note-20d|impossible]] unto you. ^verse-20

**21**  Howbeit this [[#^note-21a|kind]] goeth not out but by prayer and [[#^note-21b|fasting]]. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be [[#^note-22a|betrayed]] into the hands of men: ^verse-22

**23**  And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be [[#^note-23a|raised]] again. And they were exceeding sorry. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received [[#^note-24a|tribute]] money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? ^verse-24

**25**  He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus [[#^note-25a|prevented him]], saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the [[#^note-25b|kings]] of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? ^verse-25

**26**  Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. ^verse-26

**27**  Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of [[#^note-27a|money]]: that take, and [[#^note-27b|give]] unto them for me and thee. ^verse-27
