### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 7|Next Entry]]

*Jesus continues the Sermon on the Mount—He teaches the disciples the Lord's Prayer—They are commanded to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.*

**1**    [[#^note-1a|Take heed]] that ye do not your [[#^note-1b|alms]] before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the [[#^note-2a|hypocrites]] do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have [[#^note-2b|glory]] of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. ^verse-2

**3**  But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: ^verse-3

**4**  That thine [[#^note-4a|alms]] may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall [[#^note-4b|reward]] thee openly. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the [[#^note-5a|hypocrites]] are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. ^verse-5

**6**  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy [[#^note-6a|closet]], and when thou hast [[#^note-6b|shut]] thy door, [[#^note-6c|pray]] to thy Father which is in [[#^note-6d|secret]]; and thy Father which [[#^note-6e|seeth]] in secret shall [[#^note-6f|reward]] thee openly. ^verse-6

**7**  But when ye pray, use not vain [[#^note-7a|repetitions]], as the [[#^note-7b|heathen]] do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. ^verse-7

**8**  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father [[#^note-8a|knoweth]] what things ye have [[#^note-8b|need]] of, before ye ask him. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|After]] this manner therefore [[#^note-9b|pray]] ye: Our [[#^note-9c|Father]] which art in heaven, [[#^note-9d|Hallowed]] be thy [[#^note-9e|name]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Thy [[#^note-10a|kingdom]] come. Thy [[#^note-10b|will be]] done [[#^note-10c|in earth]], as it is in heaven. ^verse-10

**11**  Give us this day our daily [[#^note-11a|bread]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And forgive us our [[#^note-12a|debts]], as we [[#^note-12b|forgive]] our debtors. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|And]] [[#^note-13b|lead]] us not into [[#^note-13c|temptation]], [[#^note-13d|but]] deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the [[#^note-13e|glory]], for ever. Amen. ^verse-13

**14**  For if ye [[#^note-14a|forgive]] men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: ^verse-14

**15**  But if ye [[#^note-15a|forgive]] not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Moreover when ye [[#^note-16a|fast]], be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They [[#^note-16b|have]] their reward. ^verse-16

**17**  But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; ^verse-17

**18**  That thou appear not unto men to [[#^note-18a|fast]], but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall [[#^note-18b|reward]] thee openly. ^verse-18

**19**    ¶ Lay not up for yourselves [[#^note-19a|treasures]] upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves [[#^note-19b|break through]] and steal: ^verse-19

**20**  But lay up for yourselves [[#^note-20a|treasures]] in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor [[#^note-20b|steal]]: ^verse-20

**21**  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. ^verse-21

**22**  The light of the body is the [[#^note-22a|eye]]: if therefore thine eye be [[#^note-22b|single]], thy whole body shall be full of [[#^note-22c|light]]. ^verse-22

**23**  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of [[#^note-23a|darkness]]. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ [[#^note-24a|No]] man can [[#^note-24b|serve]] two [[#^note-24c|masters]]: for either he will [[#^note-24d|hate]] the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and [[#^note-24e|mammon]]. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Therefore]] I say unto you, Take no [[#^note-25b|thought]] for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? ^verse-25

**26**  Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? ^verse-26

**27**  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? ^verse-27

**28**  And why take ye thought for raiment? [[#^note-28a|Consider]] the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: ^verse-28

**29**  And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ^verse-29

**30**  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [[#^note-30a|shall]] he not much more clothe you, O ye of little [[#^note-30b|faith]]? ^verse-30

**31**  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? ^verse-31

**32**  (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father [[#^note-32a|knoweth]] that ye have need of all these things. ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|But]] [[#^note-33b|seek]] ye first the [[#^note-33c|kingdom]] of God, and his [[#^note-33d|righteousness]]; and all these [[#^note-33e|things]] shall be [[#^note-33f|added]] unto you. ^verse-33

**34**  Take therefore no [[#^note-34a|thought]] for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. ^verse-34
