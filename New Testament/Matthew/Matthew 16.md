### Chapter 16

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 17|Next Entry]]

*Jesus warns against the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees—Peter testifies that Jesus is the Christ and is promised the keys of the kingdom—Jesus foretells His death and resurrection.*

**1**  The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from [[#^note-1a|heaven]]. ^verse-1

**2**  He [[#^note-2a|answered]] and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. ^verse-2

**3**  And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and [[#^note-3a|lowring]]. O ye [[#^note-3b|hypocrites]], ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the [[#^note-3c|signs]] of the [[#^note-3d|times]]? ^verse-3

**4**  A wicked and [[#^note-4a|adulterous]] generation seeketh after a [[#^note-4b|sign]]; and there shall no [[#^note-4c|sign]] be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet [[#^note-4d|Jonas]]. And he left them, and departed. ^verse-4

**5**  And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the [[#^note-6a|leaven]] of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. ^verse-6

**7**  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Which when Jesus perceived]], he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? ^verse-8

**9**  Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? ^verse-9

**10**  Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? ^verse-10

**11**  How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? ^verse-11

**12**  Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the [[#^note-12a|doctrine]] of the Pharisees and of the [[#^note-12b|Sadducees]]. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? ^verse-13

**14**  And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, [[#^note-14a|Elias]]; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. ^verse-14

**15**  He saith unto them, But whom say [[#^note-15a|ye]] that I am? ^verse-15

**16**  And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the [[#^note-16a|Christ]], the [[#^note-16b|Son]] of the [[#^note-16c|living God]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon [[#^note-17a|Bar-jona]]: for flesh and blood hath not [[#^note-17b|revealed]] it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. ^verse-17

**18**  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this [[#^note-18a|rock]] I will build my [[#^note-18b|church]]; and the gates of [[#^note-18c|hell]] shall not [[#^note-18d|prevail]] against it. ^verse-18

**19**  And I will [[#^note-19a|give]] unto thee the [[#^note-19b|keys]] of the [[#^note-19c|kingdom]] of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt [[#^note-19d|bind]] on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ^verse-19

**20**  Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the [[#^note-20a|Christ]]. ^verse-20

**21**    ¶ From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be [[#^note-21a|raised]] again the third day. ^verse-21

**22**  Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. ^verse-22

**23**  But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou [[#^note-23a|savourest]] not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ [[#^note-24a|Then]] said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him [[#^note-24b|deny]] himself, and take up his [[#^note-24c|cross]], and [[#^note-24d|follow]] [[#^note-24e|me]]. ^verse-24

**25**  For whosoever will save his life shall [[#^note-25a|lose]] it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall [[#^note-25b|find]] it. ^verse-25

**26**  For what is a man [[#^note-26a|profited]], if he shall [[#^note-26b|gain]] the whole [[#^note-26c|world]], and [[#^note-26d|lose]] his own [[#^note-26e|soul]]? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? ^verse-26

**27**    For the [[#^note-27a|Son of man]] shall come in the [[#^note-27b|glory]] of his Father with his angels; and then he shall [[#^note-27c|reward]] every man according to his [[#^note-27d|works]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of [[#^note-28a|death]], till they see the Son of man coming in his [[#^note-28b|kingdom]]. ^verse-28
