*The wise men are directed by a star to Jesus—Joseph takes the child to Egypt—Herod slays the children in Bethlehem—Jesus is taken to Nazareth to dwell.*

**1**    Now when Jesus was [[#^note-1a|born]] in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, ^verse-1

**2**  Saying, [[#^note-2a|Where]] is he that is born [[#^note-2b|King of the Jews]]? for we have seen his [[#^note-2c|star]] in the east, and are come to [[#^note-2d|worship]] him. ^verse-2

**3**  When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|And]] when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he [[#^note-4b|demanded]] of them where Christ should be born. ^verse-4

**5**  And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet, ^verse-5

**6**  And thou [[#^note-6a|Bethlehem]], in the land of [[#^note-6b|Juda]], art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a [[#^note-6c|Governor]], that shall [[#^note-6d|rule]] my people Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. ^verse-7

**8**  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. ^verse-8

**9**  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. ^verse-9

**10**  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and [[#^note-11a|frankincense]], and myrrh. ^verse-11

**12**  And being warned of God in a [[#^note-12a|dream]] that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. ^verse-12

**13**    And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. ^verse-13

**14**  When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: ^verse-14

**15**  And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of [[#^note-15a|Egypt]] have I called my son. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ Then Herod, when he saw that he was [[#^note-16a|mocked of]] the wise men, [[#^note-16b|was exceeding wroth]], and sent forth, and [[#^note-16c|slew]] all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the [[#^note-16d|coasts]] thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. ^verse-16

**17**  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by [[#^note-17a|Jeremy]] the prophet, saying, ^verse-17

**18**  In [[#^note-18a|Rama]] was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great [[#^note-18b|mourning]], Rachel weeping for her [[#^note-18c|children]], and would not be comforted, because they are not. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a [[#^note-19a|dream]] to Joseph in Egypt, ^verse-19

**20**  Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the [[#^note-20a|land of Israel]]: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. ^verse-20

**21**  And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. ^verse-21

**22**  But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judæa in the [[#^note-22a|room]] of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a [[#^note-22b|dream]], he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: ^verse-22

**23**  And he came and dwelt in a city called [[#^note-23a|Nazareth]]: that it might be fulfilled which was [[#^note-23b|spoken]] by the prophets, He shall be called a [[#^note-23c|Nazarene]]. ^verse-23
