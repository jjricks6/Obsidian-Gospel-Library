### Chapter 19

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 18|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 20|Next Entry]]

*Jesus teaches about marriage and divorce—Eternal life is for those who keep the commandments—The Twelve Apostles will judge the house of Israel.*

**1**  And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan; ^verse-1

**2**  And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to [[#^note-3a|put away]] his wife for every cause? ^verse-3

**4**  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which [[#^note-4a|made]] them at the beginning made them male and female, ^verse-4

**5**  And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall [[#^note-5a|cleave]] to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath [[#^note-6a|joined]] together, let not man [[#^note-6b|put asunder]]. ^verse-6

**7**  They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a [[#^note-7a|writing]] of [[#^note-7b|divorcement]], and to put her away? ^verse-7

**8**  He saith unto them, Moses because of the [[#^note-8a|hardness]] of your hearts suffered you to put away your [[#^note-8b|wives]]: but from the beginning it was not so. ^verse-8

**9**  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for [[#^note-9a|fornication]], and shall marry another, committeth [[#^note-9b|adultery]]: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. ^verse-10

**11**  But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. ^verse-11

**12**  For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his [[#^note-13a|hands]] on [[#^note-13b|them]], and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. ^verse-13

**14**  But Jesus said, [[#^note-14a|Suffer]] little [[#^note-14b|children]], and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-14

**15**  And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. ^verse-15

**16**    ¶ And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have [[#^note-16a|eternal life]]? ^verse-16

**17**  And he said unto him, Why callest thou me [[#^note-17a|good]]? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into [[#^note-17b|life]], keep the [[#^note-17c|commandments]]. ^verse-17

**18**  He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no [[#^note-18a|murder]], Thou shalt not commit [[#^note-18b|adultery]], Thou shalt not [[#^note-18c|steal]], Thou shalt not bear [[#^note-18d|false witness]], ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Honour]] thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt [[#^note-19b|love]] thy [[#^note-19c|neighbour]] as thyself. ^verse-19

**20**  The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? ^verse-20

**21**  Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be [[#^note-21a|perfect]], go and sell that thou hast, and [[#^note-21b|give]] to the [[#^note-21c|poor]], and thou shalt have [[#^note-21d|treasure]] in heaven: and come and [[#^note-21e|follow]] me. ^verse-21

**22**  But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had [[#^note-22a|great]] possessions. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a [[#^note-23a|rich]] man shall [[#^note-23b|hardly]] enter into the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-23

**24**  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a [[#^note-24a|rich]] man to enter into the kingdom of God. ^verse-24

**25**  When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|But]] Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is im[[#^note-26b|possible]]; but with God all things are possible. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? ^verse-27

**28**  And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the [[#^note-28a|regeneration]] when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, [[#^note-28b|judging]] the twelve tribes of Israel. ^verse-28

**29**  And every one that hath [[#^note-29a|forsaken]] houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my [[#^note-29b|name's]] sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit [[#^note-29c|everlasting life]]. ^verse-29

**30**  But many that are [[#^note-30a|first]] shall be last; and the last shall be first. ^verse-30
