*Jesus heals a leper, cures the centurion's servant and others, stills the tempest, and casts out devils—The devils enter a herd of swine.*

**1**  When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, there came a [[#^note-2a|leper]] and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. ^verse-2

**3**  And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was [[#^note-3a|cleansed]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, ^verse-5

**6**  And saying, Lord, my [[#^note-6a|servant]] lieth at home sick of the [[#^note-6b|palsy]], grievously tormented. ^verse-6

**7**  And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. ^verse-7

**8**  The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not [[#^note-8a|worthy]] that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be [[#^note-8b|healed]]. ^verse-8

**9**  For I am a man under [[#^note-9a|authority]], having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|When Jesus]] heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great [[#^note-10b|faith]], no, not in Israel. ^verse-10

**11**  And I say unto you, That [[#^note-11a|many]] shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. ^verse-11

**12**  But the [[#^note-12a|children]] of the kingdom shall be cast out into [[#^note-12b|outer darkness]]: there shall be [[#^note-12c|weeping]] and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-12

**13**  And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his [[#^note-14a|wife's]] mother [[#^note-14b|laid]], and sick of a fever. ^verse-14

**15**  And he [[#^note-15a|touched]] her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. ^verse-15

**16**  ¶ When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with [[#^note-16a|devils]]: and he cast out the [[#^note-16b|spirits]] with his word, and [[#^note-16c|healed]] all that were sick: ^verse-16

**17**  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, [[#^note-17a|Himself]] took our [[#^note-17b|infirmities]], and bare our [[#^note-17c|sicknesses]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. ^verse-18

**19**  And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will [[#^note-19a|follow]] thee whithersoever thou goest. ^verse-19

**20**  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. ^verse-20

**21**  And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, [[#^note-21a|suffer]] me first to go and bury my father. ^verse-21

**22**  But Jesus said unto him, [[#^note-22a|Follow]] me; and let the [[#^note-22b|dead]] bury their dead. ^verse-22

**23**    ¶ And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. ^verse-23

**24**  And, behold, there arose a great [[#^note-24a|tempest]] in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. ^verse-24

**25**  And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. ^verse-25

**26**  And he saith unto them, Why are ye [[#^note-26a|fearful]], O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and [[#^note-26b|rebuked]] the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. ^verse-26

**27**  But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the [[#^note-27a|sea]] obey him! ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with [[#^note-28a|devils]], coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. ^verse-28

**29**  And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before [[#^note-29a|the time]]? ^verse-29

**30**  And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. ^verse-30

**31**  So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. ^verse-31

**32**  And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. ^verse-32

**33**  And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. ^verse-33

**34**  And, behold, the whole city came out to [[#^note-34a|meet]] Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their [[#^note-34b|coasts]]. ^verse-34
