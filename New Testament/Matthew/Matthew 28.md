### Chapter 28

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Mark|Next Entry]]

*Christ the Lord is risen—He appears to many—He has all power in heaven and earth—He sends the Apostles to teach and baptize all nations.*

**1**    [[#^note-1a|In]] the end of the [[#^note-1b|sabbath]], as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, [[#^note-2a|the]]re was a great earthquake: for the [[#^note-2b|angel]] of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|His]] [[#^note-3b|countenance]] was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: ^verse-3

**4**  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|And]] the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. ^verse-5

**6**  He is not here: for he is [[#^note-6a|risen]], as he said. Come, see the place where the [[#^note-6b|Lord]] lay. ^verse-6

**7**  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. ^verse-7

**8**  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, [[#^note-9a|Jesus]] met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. ^verse-9

**10**  Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. ^verse-10

**11**  ¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the [[#^note-11a|watch]] came into the city, and [[#^note-11b|shewed]] unto the chief priests all the things that were done. ^verse-11

**12**  And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave [[#^note-12a|large money]] unto the soldiers, ^verse-12

**13**  Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. ^verse-13

**14**  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and [[#^note-14a|secure you]]. ^verse-14

**15**  So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. ^verse-15

**16**    ¶ Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. ^verse-16

**17**  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some [[#^note-17a|doubted]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And [[#^note-18a|Jesus]] came and spake unto them, saying, All [[#^note-18b|power]] is given unto me in heaven and in earth. ^verse-18

**19**    ¶ Go ye therefore, and [[#^note-19a|teach]] all [[#^note-19b|nations]], [[#^note-19c|baptizing]] them in the name of the [[#^note-19d|Father]], and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Teaching]] them to [[#^note-20b|observe]] all things whatsoever I have [[#^note-20c|commanded]] you: and, lo, [[#^note-20d|I]] am with you alway, even unto the [[#^note-20e|end]] of the world. Amen. ^verse-20
