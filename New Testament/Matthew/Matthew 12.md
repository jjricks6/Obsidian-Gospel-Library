### Chapter 12

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 13|Next Entry]]

*Jesus proclaims Himself Lord of the Sabbath and heals on the Sabbath day—He is accused of casting out devils through the power of Beelzebub—He speaks of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost and says that an evil and adulterous generation seeks signs.*

**1**  At that time Jesus went on the [[#^note-1a|sabbath]] day through the [[#^note-1b|corn]]; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the [[#^note-1c|ears]] of corn, and to eat. ^verse-1

**2**  But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. ^verse-2

**3**  But he said unto them, Have ye not [[#^note-3a|read]] what [[#^note-3b|David]] did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; ^verse-3

**4**  How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the [[#^note-4a|shewbread]], which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? ^verse-4

**5**  Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the [[#^note-5a|sabbath]] days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? ^verse-5

**6**  But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the [[#^note-6a|temple]]. ^verse-6

**7**  But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have [[#^note-7a|mercy]], and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. ^verse-7

**8**  For the Son of man is Lord even of the [[#^note-8a|sabbath]] day. ^verse-8

**9**  And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. ^verse-10

**11**  And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? ^verse-11

**12**  How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. ^verse-12

**13**  Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. ^verse-14

**15**  But [[#^note-15a|when]] Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; ^verse-15

**16**  And charged them that they should not make him known: ^verse-16

**17**  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by [[#^note-17a|Esaias]] the prophet, saying, ^verse-17

**18**  Behold my [[#^note-18a|servant]], whom I have [[#^note-18b|chosen]]; my [[#^note-18c|beloved]], in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. ^verse-18

**19**  He shall not strive, nor [[#^note-19a|cry]]; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. ^verse-19

**20**  A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth [[#^note-20a|judgment]] unto victory. ^verse-20

**21**  And in his [[#^note-21a|name]] shall the [[#^note-21b|Gentiles]] trust. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. ^verse-22

**23**  And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of [[#^note-23a|David]]? ^verse-23

**24**  But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by [[#^note-24a|Beelzebub]] the prince of the devils. ^verse-24

**25**  And Jesus knew their [[#^note-25a|thoughts]], and said unto them, Every [[#^note-25b|kingdom]] divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: ^verse-25

**26**  And if [[#^note-26a|Satan]] cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? ^verse-26

**27**  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. ^verse-27

**28**  But if I cast out [[#^note-28a|devils]] by the [[#^note-28b|Spirit]] of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto [[#^note-28c|you]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and [[#^note-29a|spoil]] his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. ^verse-29

**30**  He that is not [[#^note-30a|with]] me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. ^verse-30

**31**    ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven [[#^note-31a|unto men: but]] the [[#^note-31b|blasphemy]] against the Holy Ghost shall [[#^note-31c|not]] be forgiven unto men. ^verse-31

**32**  And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be [[#^note-32a|forgiven]] him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. ^verse-32

**33**  Either make the tree good, and his [[#^note-33a|fruit]] good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his [[#^note-33b|fruit]] corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. ^verse-33

**34**  O [[#^note-34a|generation]] of vipers, how can ye, being evil, [[#^note-34b|speak]] good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. ^verse-34

**35**  A good man out of the good [[#^note-35a|treasure]] of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an [[#^note-35b|evil]] man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. ^verse-35

**36**  But I say unto you, That every [[#^note-36a|idle]] [[#^note-36b|word]] that men shall [[#^note-36c|speak]], they shall give [[#^note-36d|account]] thereof in the day of [[#^note-36e|judgment]]. ^verse-36

**37**  For by thy [[#^note-37a|words]] thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. ^verse-37

**38**  ¶ Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a [[#^note-38a|sign]] from thee. ^verse-38

**39**  But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a [[#^note-39a|sign]]; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: ^verse-39

**40**  For as Jonas was [[#^note-40a|three]] days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ^verse-40

**41**  The men of [[#^note-41a|Nineveh]] shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they [[#^note-41b|repented]] at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. ^verse-41

**42**  The [[#^note-42a|queen]] of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. ^verse-42

**43**  [[#^note-43a|When]] the [[#^note-43b|unclean spirit]] is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. ^verse-43

**44**  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. ^verse-44

**45**  Then goeth [[#^note-45a|he, and taketh]] with himself seven other [[#^note-45b|spirits]] more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last [[#^note-45c|state]] of that man is [[#^note-45d|worse]] than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. ^verse-45

**46**  ¶ While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his [[#^note-46a|brethren]] stood [[#^note-46b|without]], desiring to speak with him. ^verse-46

**47**  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. ^verse-47

**48**  But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? ^verse-48

**49**  And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my [[#^note-49a|mother]] and my brethren! ^verse-49

**50**  For whosoever shall do the [[#^note-50a|will]] of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my [[#^note-50b|brother]], and sister, and mother. ^verse-50
