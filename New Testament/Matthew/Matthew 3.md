*John the Baptist preaches in Judæa—Jesus is baptized, and the Father acclaims Him as His Beloved Son.*

**1**    In those days came [[#^note-1a|John the Baptist]], preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, ^verse-1

**2**  And saying, [[#^note-2a|Repent]] ye: for the [[#^note-2b|kingdom]] of heaven [[#^note-2c|is at hand]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet [[#^note-3a|Esaias]], saying, The [[#^note-3b|voice]] of one crying in the wilderness, [[#^note-3c|Prepare]] ye the way of the Lord, make his [[#^note-3d|paths]] straight. ^verse-3

**4**  And the same John had his [[#^note-4a|raiment]] of [[#^note-4b|camel's]] hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was [[#^note-4c|locusts]] and wild honey. ^verse-4

**5**  Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan, ^verse-5

**6**  And were baptized of him in Jordan, [[#^note-6a|confessing]] their sins. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his [[#^note-7a|baptism]], he said unto them, O [[#^note-7b|generation of vipers]], who hath [[#^note-7c|warned]] you to flee from the wrath to come? ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Bring]] forth therefore fruits [[#^note-8b|meet for]] [[#^note-8c|repentance]]: ^verse-8

**9**  And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham [[#^note-9a|to our father]]: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. ^verse-9

**10**  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which [[#^note-10a|bringeth]] not forth good fruit is [[#^note-10b|hewn]] down, and cast into the fire. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|I]] indeed [[#^note-11b|baptize]] you with water unto [[#^note-11c|repentance]]: but [[#^note-11d|he]] that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not [[#^note-11e|worthy]] to bear: he shall [[#^note-11f|baptize]] you with the Holy Ghost, and with [[#^note-11g|fire]]: ^verse-11

**12**  Whose [[#^note-12a|fan]] is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the [[#^note-12b|garner]]; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable [[#^note-12c|fire]]. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be [[#^note-13a|baptized]] of him. ^verse-13

**14**  But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|And]] Jesus answering said unto him, [[#^note-15b|Suffer]] it to be so now: for thus it [[#^note-15c|becometh us]] to [[#^note-15d|fulfil]] all [[#^note-15e|righteousness]]. Then he suffered him. ^verse-15

**16**  And Jesus, when he was [[#^note-16a|baptized]], went up [[#^note-16b|straightway]] out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the [[#^note-16c|Spirit]] of God descending like a [[#^note-16d|dove]], and lighting upon him: ^verse-16

**17**  And lo a [[#^note-17a|voice]] from heaven, saying, This is my [[#^note-17b|beloved]] [[#^note-17c|Son]], in whom I am well pleased. ^verse-17
