### Chapter 24

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 23|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 25|Next Entry]]

*Jesus foretells the doom of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple—Great calamities will precede His Second Coming—He gives the parable of the fig tree.*

**1**  And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to [[#^note-1a|shew]] him the buildings of the [[#^note-1b|temple]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And Jesus said unto them, [[#^note-2a|See]] ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one [[#^note-2b|stone]] upon another, that shall not be thrown down. ^verse-2

**3**  ¶ And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the [[#^note-3a|sign]] of thy coming, and of the end of the [[#^note-3b|world]]? ^verse-3

**4**  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man [[#^note-4a|deceive]] you. ^verse-4

**5**  For many shall come in my [[#^note-5a|name]], saying, I am [[#^note-5b|Christ]]; and shall [[#^note-5c|deceive]] many. ^verse-5

**6**  And ye shall hear of [[#^note-6a|wars]] and rumours of wars: see that ye be not [[#^note-6b|troubled]]: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. ^verse-6

**7**  For [[#^note-7a|nation]] shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be [[#^note-7b|famines]], and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. ^verse-7

**8**  All these are the beginning of [[#^note-8a|sorrows]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall [[#^note-9a|kill]] you: and ye shall be [[#^note-9b|hated]] of all nations [[#^note-9c|for my name's sake]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And then shall many be [[#^note-10a|offended]], and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. ^verse-10

**11**  And many [[#^note-11a|false prophets]] shall rise, and shall deceive many. ^verse-11

**12**  And because [[#^note-12a|iniquity]] shall abound, the love of many shall wax [[#^note-12b|cold]]. ^verse-12

**13**  But he that shall [[#^note-13a|endure]] unto the end, the same shall be saved. ^verse-13

**14**  And this [[#^note-14a|gospel]] of the [[#^note-14b|kingdom]] shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the [[#^note-14c|end]] come. ^verse-14

**15**  When ye therefore shall see the [[#^note-15a|abomination of desolation]], spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the [[#^note-15b|holy place]], (whoso readeth, let him [[#^note-15c|understand]]:) ^verse-15

**16**  Then let them which be in Judæa [[#^note-16a|flee]] into the mountains: ^verse-16

**17**  Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: ^verse-17

**18**  Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. ^verse-18

**19**  And [[#^note-19a|woe]] unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! ^verse-19

**20**  But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: ^verse-20

**21**  For then shall be great [[#^note-21a|tribulation]], such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. ^verse-21

**22**  And except those [[#^note-22a|days]] should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. ^verse-22

**23**  Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; [[#^note-23a|believe]] it not. ^verse-23

**24**  For there shall arise [[#^note-24a|false]] [[#^note-24b|Christs]], and [[#^note-24c|false prophets]], and shall shew great [[#^note-24d|signs]] and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall [[#^note-24e|deceive]] the very [[#^note-24f|elect]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Behold, I have told you before. ^verse-25

**26**  Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the [[#^note-26a|secret]] chambers; believe it not. ^verse-26

**27**  For as the [[#^note-27a|lightning]] cometh out of the [[#^note-27b|east]], and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ^verse-27

**28**  For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be [[#^note-28a|gathered]] together. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ Immediately after the tribulation of those [[#^note-29a|days]] shall the [[#^note-29b|sun]] be [[#^note-29c|darkened]], and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: ^verse-29

**30**    And then shall appear the [[#^note-30a|sign]] of the Son of man in [[#^note-30b|heaven]]: and then shall all the tribes of the earth [[#^note-30c|mourn]], and they shall see the [[#^note-30d|Son of man]] coming in the clouds of heaven with [[#^note-30e|power]] and great [[#^note-30f|glory]]. ^verse-30

**31**  And he shall send his [[#^note-31a|angels]] with a great sound of a [[#^note-31b|trumpet]], and they shall gather together his [[#^note-31c|elect]] from the four winds, from one end of [[#^note-31d|heaven]] to the other. ^verse-31

**32**  Now learn a parable of the [[#^note-32a|fig tree]]; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: ^verse-32

**33**  So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that [[#^note-33a|it is near]], even at the [[#^note-33b|doors]]. ^verse-33

**34**  Verily I say unto you, This [[#^note-34a|generation]] shall not pass, till all these [[#^note-34b|things]] be [[#^note-34c|fulfilled]]. ^verse-34

**35**  Heaven and earth shall [[#^note-35a|pass]] away, but my [[#^note-35b|words]] shall not [[#^note-35c|pass away]]. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ But of that [[#^note-36a|day]] and [[#^note-36b|hour]] knoweth no man, no, not the [[#^note-36c|angels]] of heaven, but my Father only. ^verse-36

**37**  But as the days of [[#^note-37a|Noe]] were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ^verse-37

**38**  For as in the days that were before the [[#^note-38a|flood]] they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, ^verse-38

**39**  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ^verse-39

**40**  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. ^verse-40

**41**  Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. ^verse-41

**42**  ¶ [[#^note-42a|Watch]] therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. ^verse-42

**43**  But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be [[#^note-43a|broken up]]. ^verse-43

**44**  Therefore be ye also [[#^note-44a|ready]]: for in such an [[#^note-44b|hour]] [[#^note-44c|as ye think not]] the Son of man cometh. ^verse-44

**45**  Who then is a [[#^note-45a|faithful]] and [[#^note-45b|wise]] [[#^note-45c|servant]], whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? ^verse-45

**46**  Blessed is that [[#^note-46a|servant]], whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. ^verse-46

**47**  Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. ^verse-47

**48**  But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord [[#^note-48a|delayeth]] his coming; ^verse-48

**49**  And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; ^verse-49

**50**  The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, ^verse-50

**51**  And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-51
