*Jesus gives the parables of the ten virgins, the talents, and the sheep and the goats.*

**1**    [[#^note-1a|Then]] shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten [[#^note-1b|virgins]], which took their [[#^note-1c|lamps]], and went forth to meet the bridegroom. ^verse-1

**2**  And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. ^verse-2

**3**  They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: ^verse-3

**4**  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. ^verse-4

**5**  While the bridegroom tarried, they all [[#^note-5a|slumbered]] and [[#^note-5b|slept]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the [[#^note-6a|bridegroom]] cometh; go ye out to meet him. ^verse-6

**7**  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their [[#^note-7a|lamps]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps [[#^note-8a|are gone out]]. ^verse-8

**9**  But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. ^verse-9

**10**  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were [[#^note-10a|ready]] went in with him to the marriage: and the door was [[#^note-10b|shut]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. ^verse-11

**12**  But he answered and said, [[#^note-12a|Verily]] I say unto you, I [[#^note-12b|know]] you not. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Watch]] therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. ^verse-13

**14**    ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. ^verse-14

**15**  And unto one he [[#^note-15a|gave]] five [[#^note-15b|talents]], to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. ^verse-15

**16**  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. ^verse-16

**17**  And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. ^verse-17

**18**  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. ^verse-18

**19**  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and [[#^note-19a|reckoneth]] with them. ^verse-19

**20**  And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou [[#^note-20a|deliveredst]] unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. ^verse-20

**21**  His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful [[#^note-21a|servant]]: thou hast been [[#^note-21b|faithful]] over a few things, I will make thee [[#^note-21c|ruler]] over many things: enter thou into the [[#^note-21d|joy]] of thy lord. ^verse-21

**22**  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. ^verse-22

**23**  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and [[#^note-23a|faithful]] servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ^verse-23

**24**  Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an [[#^note-24a|hard]] man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: ^verse-24

**25**  And I was [[#^note-25a|afraid]], and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. ^verse-25

**26**  His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and [[#^note-26a|slothful]] servant, thou knewest that I [[#^note-26b|reap]] where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: ^verse-26

**27**  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with [[#^note-27a|usury]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Take therefore the [[#^note-28a|talent]] from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. ^verse-28

**29**  For unto every one that hath shall be [[#^note-29a|given]], and he shall have [[#^note-29b|abundance]]: but from him that hath not shall be [[#^note-29c|taken]] away even that which he hath. ^verse-29

**30**  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-30

**31**    ¶ When the [[#^note-31a|Son of man]] shall come in his [[#^note-31b|glory]], and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: ^verse-31

**32**  And before him shall be gathered all [[#^note-32a|nations]]: and he shall [[#^note-32b|separate]] them one from another, as a [[#^note-32c|shepherd]] divideth his [[#^note-32d|sheep]] from the goats: ^verse-32

**33**  And he shall set the sheep on his [[#^note-33a|right hand]], but the goats on the left. ^verse-33

**34**  Then shall the King say unto them on his [[#^note-34a|right hand]], Come, ye [[#^note-34b|blessed]] of my Father, [[#^note-34c|inherit]] the [[#^note-34d|kingdom]] prepared for you from the foundation of the world: ^verse-34

**35**  For I was an [[#^note-35a|hungred]], and ye [[#^note-35b|gave]] me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a [[#^note-35c|stranger]], and ye took me in: ^verse-35

**36**  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye [[#^note-36a|visited]] me: I was in [[#^note-36b|prison]], and ye came unto me. ^verse-36

**37**  Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? ^verse-37

**38**  When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? ^verse-38

**39**  Or when saw we thee [[#^note-39a|sick]], or in prison, and came unto thee? ^verse-39

**40**    And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have [[#^note-40a|done]] it unto one of the [[#^note-40b|least]] of these my [[#^note-40c|brethren]], ye have done it unto me. ^verse-40

**41**  Then shall he say also unto them on the [[#^note-41a|left]] hand, [[#^note-41b|Depart]] from me, ye [[#^note-41c|cursed]], into everlasting [[#^note-41d|fire]], [[#^note-41e|prepared]] for the devil and his angels: ^verse-41

**42**  For I was an [[#^note-42a|hungred]], and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: ^verse-42

**43**  I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. ^verse-43

**44**  Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? ^verse-44

**45**  Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the [[#^note-45a|least]] of these, ye did it not to me. ^verse-45

**46**  And these shall go away into [[#^note-46a|everlasting]] [[#^note-46b|punishment]]: but the [[#^note-46c|righteous]] into [[#^note-46d|life]] [[#^note-46e|eternal]]. ^verse-46
