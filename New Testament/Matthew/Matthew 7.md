### Chapter 7

[[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 8|Next Entry]]

*Jesus concludes the Sermon on the Mount—He commands, Judge not; ask of God; beware of false prophets—He promises salvation to those who do the will of the Father.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Judge]] not, that ye be not [[#^note-1b|judged]]. ^verse-1

**2**  For with what [[#^note-2a|judgment]] ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what [[#^note-2b|measure]] ye mete, it shall be [[#^note-2c|measured]] to you again. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|And]] why beholdest thou the [[#^note-3b|mote]] that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the [[#^note-3c|beam]] that is in thine own eye? ^verse-3

**4**  Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? ^verse-4

**5**  Thou [[#^note-5a|hypocrite]], first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ [[#^note-6a|Give]] not that which is [[#^note-6b|holy]] unto the dogs, neither cast ye your [[#^note-6c|pearls]] before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ [[#^note-7a|Ask]], and it shall be [[#^note-7b|given]] you; [[#^note-7c|seek]], and ye shall find; [[#^note-7d|knock]], and it shall be opened unto you: ^verse-7

**8**  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that [[#^note-8a|seeketh]] findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. ^verse-8

**9**  Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask [[#^note-9a|bread]], will he give him a stone? ^verse-9

**10**  Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? ^verse-10

**11**  If ye then, [[#^note-11a|being evil]], know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore all things [[#^note-12a|whatsoever]] ye would that [[#^note-12b|men]] should [[#^note-12c|do]] to you, [[#^note-12d|do]] ye even so to them: for this is the [[#^note-12e|law]] and the prophets. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ Enter ye in at the [[#^note-13a|strait]] [[#^note-13b|gate]]: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to [[#^note-13c|destruction]], and many there be which go in thereat: ^verse-13

**14**  Because [[#^note-14a|strait]] is the [[#^note-14b|gate]], and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto [[#^note-14c|life]], and few there be that find it. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ Beware of [[#^note-15a|false prophets]], which come to you in [[#^note-15b|sheep's]] clothing, but [[#^note-15c|inwardly]] they are ravening [[#^note-15d|wolves]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Ye shall [[#^note-16a|know]] them by their [[#^note-16b|fruits]]. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? ^verse-16

**17**  Even so every [[#^note-17a|good]] tree bringeth forth good [[#^note-17b|fruit]]; but a [[#^note-17c|corrupt]] tree bringeth forth [[#^note-17d|evil]] fruit. ^verse-17

**18**  A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ^verse-18

**19**  Every tree that bringeth not forth good [[#^note-19a|fruit]] is [[#^note-19b|hewn]] down, and cast into the fire. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore by their [[#^note-20a|fruits]] ye shall know them. ^verse-20

**21**  ¶ Not every one that [[#^note-21a|saith]] unto me, [[#^note-21b|Lord]], Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that [[#^note-21c|doeth]] the [[#^note-21d|will]] of my Father which is in [[#^note-21e|heaven]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not [[#^note-22a|prophesied]] in thy [[#^note-22b|name]]? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|And]] then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: [[#^note-23b|depart]] from me, ye that work [[#^note-23c|iniquity]]. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ Therefore whosoever [[#^note-24a|heareth]] these sayings of mine, and [[#^note-24b|doeth]] them, [[#^note-24c|I]] will liken him unto a [[#^note-24d|wise]] man, which [[#^note-24e|built]] his house upon [[#^note-24f|a rock]]: ^verse-24

**25**  And the [[#^note-25a|rain]] descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and [[#^note-25b|beat]] upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a [[#^note-25c|rock]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a [[#^note-26a|foolish]] man, which built his house upon the sand: ^verse-26

**27**  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that [[#^note-27a|house]]; and it [[#^note-27b|fell]]: and great was the fall of it. ^verse-27

**28**  And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended [[#^note-28a|these sayings, the people]] were [[#^note-28b|astonished]] at his [[#^note-28c|doctrine]]: ^verse-28

**29**  For he taught them as one having [[#^note-29a|authority]], and not as [[#^note-29b|the scribes]]. ^verse-29
