[[New Testament/Matthew|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Matthew/Matthew 2|Next Entry]]

*Christ is born of Mary—She conceives by the power of the Holy Ghost—Our Lord is named Jesus.*

**1**    The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of [[#^note-1a|David]], the son of Abraham. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Abraham]] begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat [[#^note-2b|Judas]] and his brethren; ^verse-2

**3**  And Judas begat [[#^note-3a|Phares]] and [[#^note-3b|Zara]] of Thamar; and Phares begat [[#^note-3c|Esrom]]; and Esrom begat Aram; ^verse-3

**4**  And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat [[#^note-4a|Naasson]]; and Naasson begat Salmon; ^verse-4

**5**  And Salmon begat [[#^note-5a|Booz]] of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; ^verse-5

**6**  And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat [[#^note-6a|Solomon]] of her that had been the wife of Urias; ^verse-6

**7**  And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; ^verse-7

**8**  And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; ^verse-8

**9**  And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; ^verse-9

**10**  And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; ^verse-10

**11**  And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to [[#^note-11a|Babylon]]: ^verse-11

**12**  And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat [[#^note-12a|Zorobabel]]; ^verse-12

**13**  And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; ^verse-13

**14**  And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; ^verse-14

**15**  And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; ^verse-15

**16**  And Jacob begat [[#^note-16a|Joseph]] the husband of [[#^note-16b|Mary]], of whom was born [[#^note-16c|Jesus]], [[#^note-16d|who]] is called [[#^note-16e|Christ]]. ^verse-16

**17**  So all the [[#^note-17a|generations]] from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ [[#^note-18a|Now]] the [[#^note-18b|birth]] of Jesus Christ was [[#^note-18c|on this wise]]: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-18

**19**  Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick [[#^note-19a|example]], [[#^note-19b|was]] minded to [[#^note-19c|put]] her away privily. ^verse-19

**20**  But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a [[#^note-20a|dream]], saying, Joseph, thou son of [[#^note-20b|David]], fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the [[#^note-20c|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his [[#^note-21a|name]] [[#^note-21b|Jesus]]: for he shall [[#^note-21c|save]] his people from their sins. ^verse-21

**22**  Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|Behold]], a [[#^note-23b|virgin]] shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his [[#^note-23c|name]] [[#^note-23d|Emmanuel]], which being interpreted is, God with us. ^verse-23

**24**  Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his [[#^note-24a|wife]]: ^verse-24

**25**  And knew her not till she had brought forth her [[#^note-25a|firstborn]] son: and he called his name Jesus. ^verse-25
