*Jesus is scourged and crucified—He places His mother in John's care—He dies and His side is pierced with a spear—He is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.*

**1**  Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and [[#^note-1a|scourged]] him. ^verse-1

**2**  And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, ^verse-2

**3**  And said, Hail, [[#^note-3a|King of the Jews]]! and they smote him with their hands. ^verse-3

**4**  Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no [[#^note-4a|fault]] in him. ^verse-4

**5**  Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! ^verse-5

**6**  When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they [[#^note-6a|cried]] out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no [[#^note-6b|fault]] in him. ^verse-6

**7**  The Jews answered him, We have a [[#^note-7a|law]], and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the [[#^note-7b|Son of God]]. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; ^verse-8

**9**  And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no [[#^note-9a|answer]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? ^verse-10

**11**  Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no [[#^note-11a|power]] at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater [[#^note-11b|sin]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a [[#^note-12a|king]] speaketh against Cæsar. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. ^verse-13

**14**  And it was the preparation of the [[#^note-14a|passover]], and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your [[#^note-14b|King]]! ^verse-14

**15**  But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, [[#^note-15a|crucify]] him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no [[#^note-15b|king]] but Cæsar. ^verse-15

**16**    Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. ^verse-16

**17**  And he [[#^note-17a|bearing]] his [[#^note-17b|cross]] went forth into a place called the place of a [[#^note-17c|skull]], which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: ^verse-17

**18**  Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. ^verse-19

**20**  This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. ^verse-20

**21**  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. ^verse-21

**22**  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. ^verse-23

**24**  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my [[#^note-24a|raiment]] among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his [[#^note-25a|mother]], and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of [[#^note-25b|Cleophas]], and Mary Magdalene. ^verse-25

**26**    When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the [[#^note-26a|disciple]] standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, [[#^note-26b|Woman]], behold thy son! ^verse-26

**27**  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy [[#^note-27a|mother]]! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. ^verse-28

**29**  Now there was set a vessel full of [[#^note-29a|vinegar]]: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. ^verse-29

**30**  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is [[#^note-30a|finished]]: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. ^verse-30

**31**  The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the [[#^note-31a|cross]] on the [[#^note-31b|sabbath]] day, (for that sabbath day was an [[#^note-31c|high]] [[#^note-31d|day]],) besought Pilate that their legs might be [[#^note-31e|broken]], and that they might be taken away. ^verse-31

**32**  Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. ^verse-32

**33**  But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they [[#^note-33a|brake]] not his legs: ^verse-33

**34**  But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. ^verse-34

**35**  And he that [[#^note-35a|saw]] it bare [[#^note-35b|record]], and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. ^verse-35

**36**  For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A [[#^note-36a|bone]] of him shall not be broken. ^verse-36

**37**  And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they [[#^note-37a|pierced]]. ^verse-37

**38**    ¶ And after this [[#^note-38a|Joseph of Arimathæa]], being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for [[#^note-38b|fear]] of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. ^verse-38

**39**  And there came also [[#^note-39a|Nicodemus]], which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of [[#^note-39b|myrrh]] and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. ^verse-39

**40**  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. ^verse-40

**41**  Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new [[#^note-41a|sepulchre]], wherein was never man yet laid. ^verse-41

**42**  There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' [[#^note-42a|preparation day]]; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand. ^verse-42
