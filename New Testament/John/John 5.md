### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/John/John 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 6|Next Entry]]

*Jesus heals an invalid on the Sabbath—He explains why men must honor the Son—Jesus promises to take the gospel to the dead—Man is resurrected, judged, and assigned his glory by the Son—Jesus obeys the divine law of witnesses.*

**1**    After this there was [[#^note-1a|a feast]] of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ^verse-1

**2**    Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. ^verse-2

**3**  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. ^verse-3

**4**  For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. ^verse-4

**5**  And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. ^verse-5

**6**  When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? ^verse-6

**7**  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. ^verse-7

**8**  Jesus saith unto him, [[#^note-8a|Rise]], take up thy bed, and walk. ^verse-8

**9**  And immediately the man was made [[#^note-9a|whole]], and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the [[#^note-9b|sabbath]]. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the [[#^note-10a|sabbath]] day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. ^verse-10

**11**  He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. ^verse-11

**12**  Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? ^verse-12

**13**  And he that was healed [[#^note-13a|wist]] not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. ^verse-13

**14**  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. ^verse-14

**15**  The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. ^verse-15

**16**  And therefore did the Jews [[#^note-16a|persecute]] Jesus, and [[#^note-16b|sought]] to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ But Jesus answered them, My Father [[#^note-17a|worketh]] hitherto, and I [[#^note-17b|work]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his [[#^note-18a|Father]], making himself [[#^note-18b|equal]] with God. ^verse-18

**19**  Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he [[#^note-19a|seeth]] the [[#^note-19b|Father]] do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. ^verse-19

**20**  For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. ^verse-20

**21**  For as the Father [[#^note-21a|raiseth]] up the dead, and [[#^note-21b|quickeneth them]]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. ^verse-21

**22**  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath [[#^note-22a|committed]] all [[#^note-22b|judgment]] unto the Son: ^verse-22

**23**  That all men should [[#^note-23a|honour]] the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that [[#^note-23b|honoureth]] not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. ^verse-23

**24**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and [[#^note-24a|believeth]] on him that sent me, hath everlasting [[#^note-24b|life]], and shall not come into [[#^note-24c|condemnation]]; but is passed from [[#^note-24d|death]] unto [[#^note-24e|life]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the [[#^note-25a|dead]] shall [[#^note-25b|hear]] the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall [[#^note-25c|live]]. ^verse-25

**26**  For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the [[#^note-26a|Son]] to have [[#^note-26b|life]] in himself; ^verse-26

**27**  And hath given him [[#^note-27a|authority]] to execute [[#^note-27b|judgment]] also, because he is the [[#^note-27c|Son of man]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the [[#^note-28a|graves]] shall [[#^note-28b|hear]] his voice, ^verse-28

**29**  And shall [[#^note-29a|come]] forth; [[#^note-29b|they]] that have done good, unto the [[#^note-29c|resurrection]] of life; and they that have done [[#^note-29d|evil]], unto the resurrection of [[#^note-29e|damnation]]. ^verse-29

**30**  I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is [[#^note-30a|just]]; because I seek not mine own [[#^note-30b|will]], but the [[#^note-30c|will]] of the Father which hath sent me. ^verse-30

**31**  If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. ^verse-31

**32**  ¶ There is another that beareth [[#^note-32a|witness]] of me; and I know that the [[#^note-32b|witness]] which he witnesseth of me is true. ^verse-32

**33**  Ye sent unto [[#^note-33a|John]], and he bare [[#^note-33b|witness]] unto the truth. ^verse-33

**34**  [[#^note-34a|But]] I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. ^verse-34

**35**  He was a burning and a shining [[#^note-35a|light]]: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his [[#^note-35b|light]]. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ [[#^note-36a|But]] I have [[#^note-36b|greater]] witness than that of John: for the [[#^note-36c|works]] which the Father hath given me to finish, the same [[#^note-36d|works]] that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath [[#^note-36e|sent]] me. ^verse-36

**37**  And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne [[#^note-37a|witness]] of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor [[#^note-37b|seen]] his shape. ^verse-37

**38**  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye [[#^note-38a|believe not]]. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ [[#^note-39a|Search]] the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which [[#^note-39b|testify]] of me. ^verse-39

**40**  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have [[#^note-40a|life]]. ^verse-40

**41**  I receive not [[#^note-41a|honour]] from men. ^verse-41

**42**  But I know you, that ye have not the [[#^note-42a|love]] of God in you. ^verse-42

**43**  I am come in my [[#^note-43a|Father's]] [[#^note-43b|name]], and ye [[#^note-43c|receive]] me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. ^verse-43

**44**  How can ye believe, which receive [[#^note-44a|honour]] one of another, and seek not the [[#^note-44b|honour]] that cometh from God only? ^verse-44

**45**  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. ^verse-45

**46**  For had ye believed [[#^note-46a|Moses]], ye would have believed me: for he [[#^note-46b|wrote]] of me. ^verse-46

**47**  But if ye believe not his [[#^note-47a|writings]], how shall ye believe my words? ^verse-47
