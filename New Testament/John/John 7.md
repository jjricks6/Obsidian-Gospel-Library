### Chapter 7

[[New Testament/John/John 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 8|Next Entry]]

*Jesus' kinsmen do not believe—He teaches His Father's doctrine and proclaims His divine sonship—Truth may be known through obedience—Jesus offers living water to all people—The people have various opinions concerning Him.*

**1**  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews [[#^note-1a|sought]] to [[#^note-1b|kill]] him. ^verse-1

**2**  Now the Jews' [[#^note-2a|feast of tabernacles]] was at hand. ^verse-2

**3**  His [[#^note-3a|brethren]] therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. ^verse-3

**4**  For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. ^verse-4

**5**  For neither did his brethren believe in him. ^verse-5

**6**  Then Jesus said unto them, My [[#^note-6a|time]] is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. ^verse-6

**7**  The world cannot hate you; but me it [[#^note-7a|hateth]], because I testify of it, that the works thereof are [[#^note-7b|evil]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. ^verse-8

**9**  When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. ^verse-10

**11**  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? ^verse-11

**12**  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. ^verse-12

**13**  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for [[#^note-13a|fear]] of the Jews. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Jews [[#^note-15a|marvelled]], saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? ^verse-15

**16**  Jesus answered them, and said, My [[#^note-16a|doctrine]] is not mine, but his that [[#^note-16b|sent]] me. ^verse-16

**17**  If any man will [[#^note-17a|do]] his [[#^note-17b|will]], he shall [[#^note-17c|know]] of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. ^verse-17

**18**  He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own [[#^note-18a|glory]]: but he that seeketh his [[#^note-18b|glory]] that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. ^verse-18

**19**  Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? ^verse-19

**20**  The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? ^verse-20

**21**  Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. ^verse-21

**22**  Moses therefore gave unto you [[#^note-22a|circumcision]]; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. ^verse-22

**23**  If a man on the [[#^note-23a|sabbath]] day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit [[#^note-23b|whole]] on the sabbath day? ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Judge not]] according to [[#^note-24b|the]] [[#^note-24c|appearance]], but judge righteous judgment. ^verse-24

**25**  Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? ^verse-25

**26**  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the [[#^note-26a|rulers]] know indeed that this is the very Christ? ^verse-26

**27**  Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. ^verse-27

**28**  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is [[#^note-28a|true]], whom ye know not. ^verse-28

**29**  But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath [[#^note-29a|sent]] me. ^verse-29

**30**  Then they [[#^note-30a|sought]] to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his [[#^note-30b|hour]] was not yet come. ^verse-30

**31**  And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? ^verse-31

**32**  ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. ^verse-32

**33**  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. ^verse-33

**34**  Ye shall [[#^note-34a|seek]] me, and shall not find me: and [[#^note-34b|where]] I am, [[#^note-34c|thither]] ye [[#^note-34d|cannot]] come. ^verse-34

**35**  Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the [[#^note-35a|Gentiles]], and teach the Gentiles? ^verse-35

**36**  What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? ^verse-36

**37**  In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man [[#^note-37a|thirst]], let him come unto me, and [[#^note-37b|drink]]. ^verse-37

**38**  He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ^verse-38

**39**  (But this spake he of the [[#^note-39a|Spirit]], which they that believe on him should receive: [[#^note-39b|for]] the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) ^verse-39

**40**  ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the [[#^note-40a|Prophet]]. ^verse-40

**41**  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? ^verse-41

**42**  Hath not the scripture said, That [[#^note-42a|Christ]] cometh of the seed of [[#^note-42b|David]], and out of the town of [[#^note-42c|Bethlehem]], where David was? ^verse-42

**43**  So there was a [[#^note-43a|division]] among the people because of him. ^verse-43

**44**  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. ^verse-44

**45**  ¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? ^verse-45

**46**  The officers answered, Never man [[#^note-46a|spake]] like this man. ^verse-46

**47**  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also [[#^note-47a|deceived]]? ^verse-47

**48**  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? ^verse-48

**49**  But this people who knoweth not the law are [[#^note-49a|cursed]]. ^verse-49

**50**  [[#^note-50a|Nicodemus]] saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) ^verse-50

**51**  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? ^verse-51

**52**  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. ^verse-52

**53**  And every man went unto his own house. ^verse-53
