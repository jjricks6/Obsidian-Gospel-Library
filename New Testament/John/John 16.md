[[New Testament/John/John 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 17|Next Entry]]

*Jesus discourses on the mission of the Holy Ghostâ€”He tells of His death and resurrection, announces that He is the Son of God, and says that He has overcome the world.*

**1**  These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be [[#^note-1a|offended]]. ^verse-1

**2**  They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever [[#^note-2a|killeth]] you will think that he doeth God service. ^verse-2

**3**  And these things will they do unto you, because they have not [[#^note-3a|known]] the Father, nor me. ^verse-3

**4**  But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. ^verse-4

**5**  But now I [[#^note-5a|go]] my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? ^verse-5

**6**  But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. ^verse-6

**7**  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is [[#^note-7a|expedient]] for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the [[#^note-7b|Comforter]] will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. ^verse-7

**8**  And when he is come, he will [[#^note-8a|reprove]] the world of sin, and of [[#^note-8b|righteousness]], and of judgment: ^verse-8

**9**  Of [[#^note-9a|sin]], because they believe not on me; ^verse-9

**10**  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; ^verse-10

**11**  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. ^verse-11

**12**  I have yet many things to [[#^note-12a|say]] unto you, but ye cannot [[#^note-12b|bear]] them now. ^verse-12

**13**  Howbeit when he, the [[#^note-13a|Spirit of truth]], is come, he will [[#^note-13b|guide]] you into all [[#^note-13c|truth]]: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will [[#^note-13d|shew]] you things to come. ^verse-13

**14**  He shall [[#^note-14a|glorify]] me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. ^verse-14

**15**  All [[#^note-15a|things]] that the [[#^note-15b|Father]] hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. ^verse-15

**16**  A little while, and ye shall not [[#^note-16a|see]] me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. ^verse-16

**17**  Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? ^verse-17

**18**  They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. ^verse-18

**19**  Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? ^verse-19

**20**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be [[#^note-20a|sorrow]]ful, but your sorrow shall be turned into [[#^note-20b|joy]]. ^verse-20

**21**  A [[#^note-21a|woman]] when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. ^verse-21

**22**  And ye now therefore have [[#^note-22a|sorrow]]: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your [[#^note-22b|joy]] no man taketh from you. ^verse-22

**23**  And in that day ye shall ask me [[#^note-23a|nothing]]. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall [[#^note-23b|ask]] the Father in my name, he will give it you. ^verse-23

**24**  Hitherto have ye [[#^note-24a|ask]]ed nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. ^verse-24

**25**  These things have I spoken unto you in [[#^note-25a|proverbs]]: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. ^verse-25

**26**  At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: ^verse-26

**27**  For the Father himself [[#^note-27a|loveth]] you, because ye have loved me, and have [[#^note-27b|believed]] that I came out from God. ^verse-27

**28**  I [[#^note-28a|came]] [[#^note-28b|forth]] from the [[#^note-28c|Father]], and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. ^verse-28

**29**  His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. ^verse-29

**30**  Now are we sure that thou [[#^note-30a|knowest]] all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. ^verse-30

**31**  Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? ^verse-31

**32**  Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me [[#^note-32a|alone]]: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. ^verse-32

**33**  These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have [[#^note-33a|peace]]. In the [[#^note-33b|world]] ye shall have [[#^note-33c|tribulation]]: but be of good [[#^note-33d|cheer]]; I have [[#^note-33e|overcome]] the world. ^verse-33
