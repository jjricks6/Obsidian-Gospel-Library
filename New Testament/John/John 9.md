*Jesus, on the Sabbath, heals a man born blind—The Jews accuse Him of Sabbath violation—He lectures them on spiritual blindness.*

**1**    And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was [[#^note-1a|blind]] from his birth. ^verse-1

**2**  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this [[#^note-2a|man]], or his parents, that he was born blind? ^verse-2

**3**  Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the [[#^note-3a|works]] of God should be made [[#^note-3b|manifest]] in him. ^verse-3

**4**  I must [[#^note-4a|work]] the [[#^note-4b|works]] of him that sent me, [[#^note-4c|while]] it is [[#^note-4d|day]]: the [[#^note-4e|night]] cometh, when no man can work. ^verse-4

**5**  As long as I am in the world, I am the [[#^note-5a|light]] of the world. ^verse-5

**6**  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, ^verse-6

**7**  And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of [[#^note-7a|Siloam]], (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? ^verse-8

**9**  Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? ^verse-10

**11**    He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and [[#^note-11a|wash]]: and I went and washed, and I received [[#^note-11b|sight]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. ^verse-13

**14**  And it was the [[#^note-14a|sabbath]] day when Jesus made the clay, and [[#^note-14b|opened]] his eyes. ^verse-14

**15**  Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. ^verse-16

**17**  They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a [[#^note-17a|prophet]]. ^verse-17

**18**  But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. ^verse-18

**19**  And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? ^verse-19

**20**  His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: ^verse-20

**21**  But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. ^verse-21

**22**  These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. ^verse-22

**23**  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. ^verse-23

**24**  Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. ^verse-24

**25**  He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. ^verse-25

**26**  Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? ^verse-26

**27**  He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? ^verse-27

**28**  Then they [[#^note-28a|reviled]] him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. ^verse-28

**29**  We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from [[#^note-29a|whence]] he is. ^verse-29

**30**  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. ^verse-30

**31**  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. ^verse-31

**32**  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born [[#^note-32a|blind]]. ^verse-32

**33**  If this man were not of [[#^note-33a|God]], he could do nothing. ^verse-33

**34**  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. ^verse-34

**35**  Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? ^verse-35

**36**  He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? ^verse-36

**37**  And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. ^verse-37

**38**  And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ And Jesus said, For [[#^note-39a|judgment]] I am come into this world, that they which [[#^note-39b|see not]] might see; and that they which see might be made blind. ^verse-39

**40**  And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? ^verse-40

**41**  Jesus said unto them, If ye were [[#^note-41a|blind]], ye should have no [[#^note-41b|sin]]: but now ye say, We [[#^note-41c|see]]; therefore your [[#^note-41d|sin]] remaineth. ^verse-41
