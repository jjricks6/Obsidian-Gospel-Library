### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/John/John 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 3|Next Entry]]

*Jesus turns water into wine in Cana—He attends the Passover, cleanses the temple, foretells His death and resurrection, and performs miracles.*

**1**    And the [[#^note-1a|third day]] there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: ^verse-1

**2**  And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. ^verse-2

**3**  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. ^verse-3

**4**  Jesus saith unto her, [[#^note-4a|Woman]], what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. ^verse-4

**5**  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. ^verse-5

**6**  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the [[#^note-6a|purifying]] of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. ^verse-6

**7**  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. ^verse-7

**8**  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. ^verse-8

**9**  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, ^verse-9

**10**  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. ^verse-10

**11**  This [[#^note-11a|beginning]] of [[#^note-11b|miracles]] did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his [[#^note-12a|brethren]], and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. ^verse-12

**13**    ¶ And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, ^verse-13

**14**  And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of [[#^note-14a|money]] sitting: ^verse-14

**15**  And when he had made a [[#^note-15a|scourge]] of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; ^verse-15

**16**    And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. ^verse-16

**17**  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The [[#^note-17a|zeal]] of thine house hath [[#^note-17b|eaten me up]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What [[#^note-18a|sign]] shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? ^verse-18

**19**  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this [[#^note-19a|temple]], and in three days I will [[#^note-19b|raise]] it up. ^verse-19

**20**  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this [[#^note-20a|temple]] in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? ^verse-20

**21**  But he spake of the temple of his body. ^verse-21

**22**  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the [[#^note-23a|passover]], in the feast day, many believed in his [[#^note-23b|name]], when they saw the [[#^note-23c|miracles]] which he did. ^verse-23

**24**  But Jesus did not [[#^note-24a|commit]] himself unto them, because he [[#^note-24b|knew]] all [[#^note-24c|men]], ^verse-24

**25**  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he [[#^note-25a|knew]] what was in [[#^note-25b|man]]. ^verse-25
