### Chapter 8

[[New Testament/John/John 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 9|Next Entry]]

*The woman taken in adultery is brought before Christ—Christ is the Light of the world—He again proclaims that He is the Messiah—The true children of Abraham believe in Christ—Jesus says, Before Abraham was I, Jehovah.*

**1**  Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. ^verse-1

**2**    And early in the morning he came again into the [[#^note-2a|temple]], and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. ^verse-2

**3**  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a [[#^note-3a|woman]] taken in [[#^note-3b|adultery]]; and when they had set her in the midst, ^verse-3

**4**  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. ^verse-4

**5**  Now Moses in the [[#^note-5a|law]] commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? ^verse-5

**6**  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger [[#^note-6a|wrote]] on the ground, as though he heard them not. ^verse-6

**7**  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without [[#^note-7a|sin]] among you, let him [[#^note-7b|first]] cast a [[#^note-7c|stone]] at her. ^verse-7

**8**  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. ^verse-8

**9**  And they which heard it, being convicted by their own [[#^note-9a|conscience]], went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. ^verse-9

**10**  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? ^verse-10

**11**  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I [[#^note-11a|condemn]] thee: go, and [[#^note-11b|sin]] no [[#^note-11c|more]]. ^verse-11

**12**    ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the [[#^note-12a|light]] of the world: he that followeth me shall not [[#^note-12b|walk]] in [[#^note-12c|darkness]], but shall have the light of life. ^verse-12

**13**  The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. ^verse-13

**14**  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know [[#^note-14a|whence]] I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell [[#^note-14b|whence]] I come, and whither I go. ^verse-14

**15**  Ye [[#^note-15a|judge]] after the flesh; I judge no man. ^verse-15

**16**  And yet if I [[#^note-16a|judge]], my [[#^note-16b|judgment]] is true: for I am not [[#^note-16c|alone]], but I and the Father that sent me. ^verse-16

**17**  It is also written in your law, that the [[#^note-17a|testimony]] of two men is true. ^verse-17

**18**  I am one that bear witness of myself, and the [[#^note-18a|Father]] that sent me beareth [[#^note-18b|witness]] of me. ^verse-18

**19**  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had [[#^note-19a|known]] me, ye should have known my Father also. ^verse-19

**20**  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. ^verse-20

**21**  Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your [[#^note-21a|sins]]: whither I go, ye cannot come. ^verse-21

**22**  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. ^verse-22

**23**  And he said unto them, Ye are from [[#^note-23a|beneath]]; I am from above: ye are of this [[#^note-23b|world]]; I am not of this world. ^verse-23

**24**  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall [[#^note-24a|die]] in your sins: for if ye [[#^note-24b|believe not]] that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. ^verse-24

**25**  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. ^verse-25

**26**  I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have [[#^note-26a|heard]] of him. ^verse-26

**27**  They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. ^verse-27

**28**  Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do [[#^note-28a|nothing]] of myself; but as my [[#^note-28b|Father]] hath [[#^note-28c|taught]] me, I [[#^note-28d|speak]] these things. ^verse-28

**29**  And he that [[#^note-29a|sent]] me is with me: the Father hath not left me [[#^note-29b|alone]]; for I [[#^note-29c|do]] always those things that [[#^note-29d|please]] him. ^verse-29

**30**  As he spake these words, many [[#^note-30a|believed]] on him. ^verse-30

**31**  Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye [[#^note-31a|continue]] in my word, then are ye my [[#^note-31b|disciples]] indeed; ^verse-31

**32**  And ye shall [[#^note-32a|know]] the [[#^note-32b|truth]], and the [[#^note-32c|truth]] shall make you [[#^note-32d|free]]. ^verse-32

**33**  ¶ They answered him, We be [[#^note-33a|Abraham's seed]], and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? ^verse-33

**34**  Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever [[#^note-34a|committeth]] [[#^note-34b|sin]] is the [[#^note-34c|servant]] of sin. ^verse-34

**35**  And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. ^verse-35

**36**  If the Son therefore shall make you [[#^note-36a|free]], ye shall be free indeed. ^verse-36

**37**  I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. ^verse-37

**38**  I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. ^verse-38

**39**  They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were [[#^note-39a|Abraham's]] [[#^note-39b|children]], ye would do the [[#^note-39c|works]] of Abraham. ^verse-39

**40**  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. ^verse-40

**41**  Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. ^verse-41

**42**  Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and [[#^note-42a|came]] from God; neither came I of myself, but he [[#^note-42b|sent]] me. ^verse-42

**43**  Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot [[#^note-43a|hear]] my word. ^verse-43

**44**  Ye are of your father the [[#^note-44a|devil]], and the [[#^note-44b|lusts]] of your father ye will do. He was a [[#^note-44c|murderer]] from the beginning, and abode not in the [[#^note-44d|truth]], because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a [[#^note-44e|lie]], he speaketh of his own: for he is a [[#^note-44f|liar]], and the father of it. ^verse-44

**45**  And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. ^verse-45

**46**  Which of you [[#^note-46a|convinceth]] me of [[#^note-46b|sin]]? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? ^verse-46

**47**  [[#^note-47a|He]] that is of God [[#^note-47b|heareth]] God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. ^verse-47

**48**  Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a [[#^note-48a|devil]]? ^verse-48

**49**  Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I [[#^note-49a|honour]] my Father, and ye do dishonour me. ^verse-49

**50**  And I seek not mine own [[#^note-50a|glory]]: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. ^verse-50

**51**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see [[#^note-51a|death]]. ^verse-51

**52**  Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never [[#^note-52a|taste]] of death. ^verse-52

**53**  Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? ^verse-53

**54**  Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my [[#^note-54a|Father]] that [[#^note-54b|honoureth]] me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: ^verse-54

**55**  Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. ^verse-55

**56**  Your father [[#^note-56a|Abraham]] [[#^note-56b|rejoiced]] to [[#^note-56c|see]] my day: and he saw it, and was glad. ^verse-56

**57**  Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? ^verse-57

**58**  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, [[#^note-58a|Before]] Abraham was, [[#^note-58b|I am]]. ^verse-58

**59**  Then took they up [[#^note-59a|stones]] to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so [[#^note-59b|passed]] by. ^verse-59
