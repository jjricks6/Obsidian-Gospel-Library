*Jesus offers the great Intercessory Prayer—He is glorified by gaining eternal life—He prays for His Apostles and all the Saints—He explains how the Father and Son are one.*

**1**  These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy [[#^note-1a|Son]], that thy Son also may [[#^note-1b|glorify]] thee: ^verse-1

**2**  As thou hast given him [[#^note-2a|power]] over all flesh, that he should give [[#^note-2b|eternal life]] to as many as thou hast [[#^note-2c|given]] him. ^verse-2

**3**  And this is [[#^note-3a|life]] [[#^note-3b|eternal]], that they might [[#^note-3c|know]] thee the only true [[#^note-3d|God]], and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast [[#^note-3e|sent]]. ^verse-3

**4**  I have [[#^note-4a|glorified]] thee on the earth: I have [[#^note-4b|finished]] the work which thou gavest me to do. ^verse-4

**5**  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the [[#^note-5a|glory]] which I had with thee [[#^note-5b|before]] the world was. ^verse-5

**6**  I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me [[#^note-6a|out]] of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. ^verse-6

**7**  Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast [[#^note-7a|given]] me are of thee. ^verse-7

**8**  For I have given unto them the [[#^note-8a|words]] which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I [[#^note-8b|came]] out from thee, and they have [[#^note-8c|believed]] that thou didst send me. ^verse-8

**9**  I [[#^note-9a|pray]] for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which [[#^note-9b|thou]] hast given me; for they are thine. ^verse-9

**10**  And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. ^verse-10

**11**  And now I am no more in the [[#^note-11a|world]], but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be [[#^note-11b|one]], as we are. ^verse-11

**12**  While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and [[#^note-12a|none]] of them is [[#^note-12b|lost]], but the son of [[#^note-12c|perdition]]; that the scripture might be fulfilled. ^verse-12

**13**  And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my [[#^note-13a|joy]] fulfilled in themselves. ^verse-13

**14**  I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. ^verse-14

**15**  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the [[#^note-15a|world]], but that thou shouldest [[#^note-15b|keep]] them from the [[#^note-15c|evil]]. ^verse-15

**16**  They are not of the [[#^note-16a|world]], even as I am not of the world. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Sanctify]] them through thy [[#^note-17b|truth]]: thy word is [[#^note-17c|truth]]. ^verse-17

**18**  As thou hast [[#^note-18a|sent]] me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. ^verse-18

**19**  And for their sakes I [[#^note-19a|sanctify]] myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. ^verse-19

**20**  Neither [[#^note-20a|pray]] I for these alone, but for them also which shall [[#^note-20b|believe]] on me through their word; ^verse-20

**21**  That they all may be [[#^note-21a|one]]; as thou, [[#^note-21b|Father]], art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be [[#^note-21c|one]] in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. ^verse-21

**22**  And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be [[#^note-22a|one]], even as we are [[#^note-22b|one]]: ^verse-22

**23**  I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made [[#^note-23a|perfect]] in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast [[#^note-23b|loved]] them, as thou hast loved me. ^verse-23

**24**  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. ^verse-24

**25**  O righteous Father, the world hath not [[#^note-25a|known]] thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. ^verse-25

**26**  And I have [[#^note-26a|declared]] unto them thy [[#^note-26b|name]], and will declare it: that the [[#^note-26c|love]] wherewith thou hast [[#^note-26d|loved]] me may be in them, and I in them. ^verse-26
