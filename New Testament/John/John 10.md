*Jesus is the Good Shepherd—He gained power over death from His Father—He promises to visit His other sheep—He proclaims, I am the Son of God.*

**1**    Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. ^verse-1

**2**  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the [[#^note-2a|sheep]]. ^verse-2

**3**  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his [[#^note-3a|voice]]: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and [[#^note-3b|leadeth]] them out. ^verse-3

**4**  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they [[#^note-4a|know]] his [[#^note-4b|voice]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of [[#^note-5a|strangers]]. ^verse-5

**6**  This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the [[#^note-7a|door]] of the sheep. ^verse-7

**8**  All that ever came before me [[#^note-8a|are thieves]] and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. ^verse-8

**9**  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. ^verse-9

**10**  The thief cometh not, but for to [[#^note-10a|steal]], and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have [[#^note-10b|life]], and that they might have it more [[#^note-10c|abundantly]]. ^verse-10

**11**    I am the good [[#^note-11a|shepherd]]: the good [[#^note-11b|shepherd]] giveth his life for the sheep. ^verse-11

**12**  But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and [[#^note-12a|leaveth]] the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|hireling]] fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. ^verse-13

**14**  I am the good [[#^note-14a|shepherd]], and [[#^note-14b|know]] my [[#^note-14c|sheep]], and am known of mine. ^verse-14

**15**  As the Father [[#^note-15a|know]]eth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my [[#^note-15b|life]] for the sheep. ^verse-15

**16**  And [[#^note-16a|other]] [[#^note-16b|sheep]] I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be [[#^note-16c|one]] fold, and one shepherd. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore doth my Father [[#^note-17a|love]] me, because I [[#^note-17b|lay down]] my life, that I might [[#^note-17c|take]] it again. ^verse-17

**18**  No man [[#^note-18a|taketh]] it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have [[#^note-18b|power]] to lay it down, and I have [[#^note-18c|power]] to take it again. This commandment have I [[#^note-18d|received]] of my Father. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. ^verse-19

**20**  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? ^verse-20

**21**  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. ^verse-22

**23**  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's [[#^note-23a|porch]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to [[#^note-24a|doubt]]? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. ^verse-24

**25**  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye [[#^note-25a|believed not]]: the [[#^note-25b|works]] that I do in my Father's [[#^note-25c|name]], they bear witness of me. ^verse-25

**26**  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. ^verse-26

**27**  My [[#^note-27a|sheep]] hear my voice, and I know them, and they [[#^note-27b|follow]] me: ^verse-27

**28**  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. ^verse-28

**29**  My Father, which [[#^note-29a|gave]] them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. ^verse-29

**30**  I and my Father are [[#^note-30a|one]]. ^verse-30

**31**  Then the Jews took up [[#^note-31a|stones]] again to stone him. ^verse-31

**32**  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? ^verse-32

**33**  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for [[#^note-33a|blasphemy]]; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself [[#^note-33b|God]]. ^verse-33

**34**  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are [[#^note-34a|gods]]? ^verse-34

**35**  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; ^verse-35

**36**  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath [[#^note-36a|sanctified]], and [[#^note-36b|sent]] into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the [[#^note-36c|Son of God]]? ^verse-36

**37**  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. ^verse-37

**38**  But if I do, though ye [[#^note-38a|believe]] not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the [[#^note-38b|Father]] is in me, and I in him. ^verse-38

**39**  Therefore they [[#^note-39a|sought]] again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, ^verse-39

**40**  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. ^verse-40

**41**  And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. ^verse-41

**42**  And many believed on him there. ^verse-42
