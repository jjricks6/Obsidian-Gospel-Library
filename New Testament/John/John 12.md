[[New Testament/John/John 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 13|Next Entry]]

*Mary anoints Jesus' feet—His triumphal entry into Jerusalem is recounted—He foretells His death—To receive Christ is to receive the Father.*

**1**  Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. ^verse-1

**2**  There they made him a supper; and [[#^note-2a|Martha]] served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. ^verse-2

**3**  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. ^verse-3

**4**  Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, ^verse-4

**5**  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? ^verse-5

**6**  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a [[#^note-6a|thief]], and had the [[#^note-6b|bag]], and bare what was put therein. ^verse-6

**7**  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: [[#^note-7a|against]] the day of my burying hath [[#^note-7b|she]] kept this. ^verse-7

**8**  For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. ^verse-8

**9**  Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. ^verse-9

**10**  ¶ But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; ^verse-10

**11**  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, ^verse-12

**13**  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. ^verse-13

**14**  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, ^verse-14

**15**  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy [[#^note-15a|King]] cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. ^verse-15

**16**  These things [[#^note-16a|understood]] not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. ^verse-16

**17**  The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. ^verse-17

**18**  For this cause the people also [[#^note-18a|met]] him, for that they heard that he had done this [[#^note-18b|miracle]]. ^verse-18

**19**  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the [[#^note-19a|world]] is gone after him. ^verse-19

**20**  ¶ And there were certain [[#^note-20a|Greeks]] among them that came up to [[#^note-20b|worship]] at the feast: ^verse-20

**21**  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. ^verse-21

**22**  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And Jesus answered them, saying, The [[#^note-23a|hour]] is come, that the Son of man should be [[#^note-23b|glorified]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a [[#^note-24a|corn]] of wheat fall into the ground and [[#^note-24b|die]], it abideth alone: but if it [[#^note-24c|die]], it bringeth forth much fruit. ^verse-24

**25**  He that loveth his [[#^note-25a|life]] shall lose it; and he that [[#^note-25b|hateth]] his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. ^verse-25

**26**  If any man serve me, let him [[#^note-26a|follow]] me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. ^verse-26

**27**  Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. ^verse-27

**28**  Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a [[#^note-28a|voice]] from heaven, saying, I have both [[#^note-28b|glorified]] it, and will glorify it again. ^verse-28

**29**  The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An [[#^note-29a|angel]] spake to him. ^verse-29

**30**  Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. ^verse-30

**31**  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the [[#^note-31a|prince]] of this world be cast out. ^verse-31

**32**  And I, if I be [[#^note-32a|lifted up]] from the earth, will [[#^note-32b|draw]] all men unto me. ^verse-32

**33**  This he said, signifying what [[#^note-33a|death]] he should die. ^verse-33

**34**  The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that [[#^note-34a|Christ]] abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? ^verse-34

**35**  Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the [[#^note-35a|light]] with you. Walk while ye have the [[#^note-35b|light]], lest [[#^note-35c|darkness]] come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. ^verse-35

**36**  While ye have light, [[#^note-36a|believe]] in the light, that ye may be the [[#^note-36b|children]] of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. ^verse-36

**37**  ¶ But though he had done so many [[#^note-37a|miracles]] before them, yet they [[#^note-37b|believed not]] on him: ^verse-37

**38**  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath [[#^note-38a|believed]] our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? ^verse-38

**39**  Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, ^verse-39

**40**  He hath [[#^note-40a|blinded]] their eyes, and [[#^note-40b|hardened]] their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. ^verse-40

**41**  These things said Esaias, when he [[#^note-41a|saw]] his [[#^note-41b|glory]], and spake of him. ^verse-41

**42**  ¶ Nevertheless among the chief [[#^note-42a|rulers]] also many [[#^note-42b|believed]] on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not [[#^note-42c|confess]] him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: ^verse-42

**43**  For they loved the [[#^note-43a|praise]] of men more than the praise of God. ^verse-43

**44**  ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that [[#^note-44a|believeth]] on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. ^verse-44

**45**  And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. ^verse-45

**46**  I am come a [[#^note-46a|light]] into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. ^verse-46

**47**  And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I [[#^note-47a|judge]] him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. ^verse-47

**48**  He that [[#^note-48a|rejecteth]] me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that [[#^note-48b|judgeth]] him: the [[#^note-48c|word]] that I have spoken, the same shall [[#^note-48d|judge]] him in the last day. ^verse-48

**49**  For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which [[#^note-49a|sent]] me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. ^verse-49

**50**  And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I [[#^note-50a|speak]] therefore, even as the [[#^note-50b|Father]] said unto me, so I [[#^note-50c|speak]]. ^verse-50
