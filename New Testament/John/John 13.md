*Jesus washes the feet of the Twelve—He identifies Judas as His betrayer—He commands them to love one another.*

**1**    Now before the feast of the [[#^note-1a|passover]], when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having [[#^note-1b|loved]] his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. ^verse-1

**2**  And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the [[#^note-2a|heart]] of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; ^verse-2

**3**  Jesus [[#^note-3a|knowing]] that the Father had given all [[#^note-3b|things]] into his hands, and that he was [[#^note-3c|come]] from God, and went to God; ^verse-3

**4**    He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. ^verse-4

**5**  After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to [[#^note-5a|wash]] the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. ^verse-5

**6**  Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? ^verse-6

**7**  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Peter]] saith unto him, Thou shalt never [[#^note-8b|wash]] my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. ^verse-8

**9**  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. ^verse-9

**10**  Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is [[#^note-10a|clean]] every whit: and ye are [[#^note-10b|clean]], but not all. ^verse-10

**11**  For he knew who should [[#^note-11a|betray]] him; therefore said he, Ye are not [[#^note-11b|all]] clean. ^verse-11

**12**  So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? ^verse-12

**13**  Ye call me [[#^note-13a|Master]] and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. ^verse-13

**14**  If I then, your Lord and [[#^note-14a|Master]], have [[#^note-14b|washed]] your feet; ye also ought to [[#^note-14c|wash]] one another's [[#^note-14d|feet]]. ^verse-14

**15**  For I have given you an [[#^note-15a|example]], that ye should do as I have done to you. ^verse-15

**16**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. ^verse-16

**17**  If ye know these things, [[#^note-17a|happy]] are ye if ye do them. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. ^verse-18

**19**  Now I tell you before it come, that, w[[#^note-19a|he]]n it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. ^verse-19

**20**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that [[#^note-20a|receiveth]] whomsoever I send [[#^note-20b|receiveth]] me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. ^verse-20

**21**  When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall [[#^note-21a|betray]] me. ^verse-21

**22**  Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. ^verse-22

**23**  Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his [[#^note-23a|disciples]], whom Jesus loved. ^verse-23

**24**  Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. ^verse-24

**25**  He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? ^verse-25

**26**  Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a [[#^note-26a|sop]], when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. ^verse-26

**27**  And after the sop [[#^note-27a|Satan]] entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. ^verse-27

**28**  Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. ^verse-28

**29**  For some of them thought, because Judas had the [[#^note-29a|bag]], that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. ^verse-29

**30**  He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the [[#^note-31a|Son of man]] glorified, and God is glorified in him. ^verse-31

**32**  If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. ^verse-32

**33**  Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall [[#^note-33a|seek]] me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. ^verse-33

**34**  A new commandment I give unto you, That ye [[#^note-34a|love]] one another; as I have [[#^note-34b|love]]d you, that ye also love one another. ^verse-34

**35**    By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have [[#^note-35a|love]] one to another. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. ^verse-36

**37**  Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I [[#^note-37a|follow]] thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. ^verse-37

**38**  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. ^verse-38
