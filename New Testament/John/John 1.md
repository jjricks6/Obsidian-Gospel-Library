# The Gospel According to St John

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/John|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 2|Next Entry]]

*Christ is the Word of God—He created all things and was made flesh—John baptizes Jesus and testifies that He is the Lamb of God—John, Andrew, Simon, Philip, and Nathanael believe in Christ and follow Him.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|In]] the [[#^note-1b|beginning]] was the [[#^note-1c|Word]], and the [[#^note-1d|Word]] was with [[#^note-1e|God]], and the Word was God. ^verse-1

**2**  The same was in the [[#^note-2a|beginning]] with God. ^verse-2

**3**  All things were [[#^note-3a|made]] by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. ^verse-3

**4**  In him was [[#^note-4a|life]]; and the life was the [[#^note-4b|light]] of men. ^verse-4

**5**  And the [[#^note-5a|light]] shineth in [[#^note-5b|darkness]]; and the darkness [[#^note-5c|comprehended]] it not. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was [[#^note-6a|John]]. ^verse-6

**7**  The same came for a [[#^note-7a|witness]], to bear [[#^note-7b|witness]] of the Light, that all men through him might [[#^note-7c|believe]]. ^verse-7

**8**  He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. ^verse-8

**9**  That was the true [[#^note-9a|Light]], which [[#^note-9b|lighteth]] [[#^note-9c|every man]] that cometh into the world. ^verse-9

**10**  He was in the [[#^note-10a|world]], and the [[#^note-10b|world]] was [[#^note-10c|made]] by him, and the world [[#^note-10d|knew]] him not. ^verse-10

**11**  He came unto his own, and his own [[#^note-11a|received]] him not. ^verse-11

**12**  But as many as [[#^note-12a|received]] him, to them gave he [[#^note-12b|power]] to become the [[#^note-12c|sons]] of God, even to them that believe on his [[#^note-12d|name]]: ^verse-12

**13**  Which were [[#^note-13a|born]], not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Word was made [[#^note-14a|flesh]], and [[#^note-14b|dwelt]] among us, (and we [[#^note-14c|beheld]] his [[#^note-14d|glory]], the glory as of the [[#^note-14e|only]] [[#^note-14f|begotten]] of the Father,) full of [[#^note-14g|grace]] and truth. ^verse-14

**15**  ¶ John bare [[#^note-15a|witness]] of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. ^verse-15

**16**  And of his [[#^note-16a|fulness]] have all we received, and [[#^note-16b|grace]] for grace. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|For]] the [[#^note-17b|law]] was given by Moses, but [[#^note-17c|grace]] and [[#^note-17d|truth]] came by Jesus Christ. ^verse-17

**18**  No [[#^note-18a|man]] hath [[#^note-18b|seen]] God [[#^note-18c|at any time]]; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath [[#^note-18d|declared]] him. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And this is the record of [[#^note-19a|John]], when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? ^verse-19

**20**  And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. ^verse-20

**21**  And they asked him, What then? Art thou [[#^note-21a|Elias]]? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. ^verse-21

**22**  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? ^verse-22

**23**  He said, I am the [[#^note-23a|voice]] of one crying in the wilderness, Make [[#^note-23b|straight]] the [[#^note-23c|way]] of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. ^verse-23

**24**  And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. ^verse-24

**25**  And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? ^verse-25

**26**  John answered them, saying, I baptize with [[#^note-26a|water]]: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; ^verse-26

**27**  [[#^note-27a|He]] it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose [[#^note-27b|shoe's latchet]] I am not worthy to unloose. ^verse-27

**28**  These things were done in [[#^note-28a|Bethabara]] beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. ^verse-28

**29**  ¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the [[#^note-29a|Lamb]] of God, which taketh away the [[#^note-29b|sin]] of the world. ^verse-29

**30**  This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. ^verse-30

**31**  And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. ^verse-31

**32**  And John [[#^note-32a|bare]] record, saying, I saw the [[#^note-32b|Spirit]] descending from heaven like a [[#^note-32c|dove]], and it abode upon him. ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|And]] I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the [[#^note-33b|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-33

**34**  And I saw, and bare [[#^note-34a|record]] that this is the Son of God. ^verse-34

**35**  ¶ Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; ^verse-35

**36**  And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the [[#^note-36a|Lamb]] of God! ^verse-36

**37**  And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. ^verse-37

**38**  Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? ^verse-38

**39**  He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. ^verse-39

**40**  One of the two which heard John speak, and [[#^note-40a|followed]] him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. ^verse-40

**41**  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the [[#^note-41a|Messias]], which is, being interpreted, the Christ. ^verse-41

**42**  And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called [[#^note-42a|Cephas]], which is by interpretation, A stone. ^verse-42

**43**  ¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. ^verse-43

**44**  Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. ^verse-44

**45**  Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom [[#^note-45a|Moses]] in the law, and the prophets, did [[#^note-45b|write]], Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. ^verse-45

**46**  And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. ^verse-46

**47**  Jesus saw [[#^note-47a|Nathanael]] coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no [[#^note-47b|guile]]! ^verse-47

**48**  Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. ^verse-48

**49**  Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the [[#^note-49a|Son of God]]; thou art the [[#^note-49b|King]] of Israel. ^verse-49

**50**  Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. ^verse-50

**51**  And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ^verse-51
