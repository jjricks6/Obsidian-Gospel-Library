[[New Testament/John/John 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 4|Next Entry]]

*Jesus tells Nicodemus that men must be born again—God so loved the world that He sent His Only Begotten Son to save men—John the Baptist testifies that he that believes on the Son has everlasting life.*

**1**    There was a man of the Pharisees, named [[#^note-1a|Nicodemus]], a [[#^note-1b|ruler]] of the Jews: ^verse-1

**2**  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these [[#^note-2a|miracles]] that thou doest, except [[#^note-2b|God]] be with him. ^verse-2

**3**  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be [[#^note-3a|born]] [[#^note-3b|again]], he cannot [[#^note-3c|see]] the kingdom of God. ^verse-3

**4**  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? ^verse-4

**5**    Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be [[#^note-5a|born]] of [[#^note-5b|water]] and of the [[#^note-5c|Spirit]], he cannot [[#^note-5d|enter]] into the kingdom of God. ^verse-5

**6**  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. ^verse-6

**7**  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be [[#^note-7a|born again]]. ^verse-7

**8**  The [[#^note-8a|wind]] bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the [[#^note-8b|Spirit]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? ^verse-9

**10**  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Verily]], verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and [[#^note-11b|testify]] that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. ^verse-11

**12**  If I have told you earthly things, and ye [[#^note-12a|believe not]], how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? ^verse-12

**13**  And no man hath [[#^note-13a|ascended]] up to heaven, but he that [[#^note-13b|came]] down from heaven, even the [[#^note-13c|Son of man]] which is in heaven. ^verse-13

**14**    ¶ And as Moses lifted up the [[#^note-14a|serpent]] in the wilderness, even so must the [[#^note-14b|Son of man]] be lifted up: ^verse-14

**15**  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. ^verse-15

**16**    ¶ For [[#^note-16a|God]] so [[#^note-16b|loved]] the [[#^note-16c|world]], that he [[#^note-16d|gave]] his [[#^note-16e|only]] begotten [[#^note-16f|Son]], that whosoever [[#^note-16g|believeth]] in him should not perish, but have [[#^note-16h|everlasting]] [[#^note-16i|life]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For God [[#^note-17a|sent]] not his Son into the world to [[#^note-17b|condemn]] the world; but that the world through him might be [[#^note-17c|saved]]. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that [[#^note-18a|believeth not]] is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the [[#^note-18b|name]] of the only begotten [[#^note-18c|Son of God]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And this is the condemnation, that [[#^note-19a|light]] is come into the world, and men loved [[#^note-19b|darkness]] rather than light, because their [[#^note-19c|deeds]] were evil. ^verse-19

**20**  For every one that doeth [[#^note-20a|evil]] [[#^note-20b|hateth]] the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. ^verse-20

**21**  But he that [[#^note-21a|doeth]] [[#^note-21b|truth]] cometh to the [[#^note-21c|light]], that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. ^verse-21

**22**  ¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and [[#^note-22a|baptized]]. ^verse-22

**23**  ¶ And John also was baptizing in Ãnon near to Salim, because there was much [[#^note-23a|water]] there: and they came, and were [[#^note-23b|baptized]]. ^verse-23

**24**  For John was not yet cast into prison. ^verse-24

**25**  ¶ Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. ^verse-25

**26**  And they came unto John, [[#^note-26a|and]] said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. ^verse-26

**27**  John answered and said, A man can [[#^note-27a|receive]] nothing, except it be given him from heaven. ^verse-27

**28**  Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. ^verse-28

**29**  He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. ^verse-29

**30**  He must increase, but I must decrease. ^verse-30

**31**  He that cometh from [[#^note-31a|above]] is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. ^verse-31

**32**  And what he hath seen and heard, that he [[#^note-32a|testifieth]]; and no man receiveth his testimony. ^verse-32

**33**  He that hath received his testimony hath [[#^note-33a|set]] to his [[#^note-33b|seal]] that God is true. ^verse-33

**34**  For he whom God hath sent [[#^note-34a|speaketh]] the words of God: [[#^note-34b|for]] God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. ^verse-34

**35**  The Father loveth the [[#^note-35a|Son]], and hath [[#^note-35b|given]] all [[#^note-35c|things]] into his hand. ^verse-35

**36**  [[#^note-36a|He]] that believeth on the Son hath [[#^note-36b|everlasting life]]: and he that [[#^note-36c|believeth not]] the Son shall not see life; but the [[#^note-36d|wrath]] of God abideth on him. ^verse-36
