[[New Testament/John/John 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 5|Next Entry]]

*Jesus teaches a woman of Samaria—All must worship the Father in spirit and truth—Those who harvest souls gain eternal life—Many Samaritans believe—Jesus heals a nobleman's son.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|When]] therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, ^verse-1

**2**  (Though Jesus himself [[#^note-2a|baptized]] not, but his disciples,) ^verse-2

**3**    He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee. ^verse-3

**4**  And he must needs go through Samaria. ^verse-4

**5**    Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son [[#^note-5a|Joseph]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. ^verse-6

**7**  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. ^verse-7

**8**  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) ^verse-8

**9**  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the [[#^note-9a|Samaritans]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the [[#^note-10a|gift]] of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee [[#^note-10b|living water]]. ^verse-10

**11**  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? ^verse-11

**12**  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? ^verse-12

**13**  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: ^verse-13

**14**  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never [[#^note-14a|thirst]]; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water [[#^note-14b|springing up]] into [[#^note-14c|everlasting life]]. ^verse-14

**15**  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. ^verse-15

**16**  Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. ^verse-16

**17**  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: ^verse-17

**18**  For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. ^verse-18

**19**  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a [[#^note-19a|prophet]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Our fathers worshipped in [[#^note-20a|this]] mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. ^verse-20

**21**  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. ^verse-21

**22**  Ye worship ye [[#^note-22a|know not]] what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. ^verse-22

**23**  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true [[#^note-23a|worship]]pers shall worship the Father in spirit and in [[#^note-23b|truth]]: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|God]] is a [[#^note-24b|Spirit]]: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in [[#^note-24c|truth]]. ^verse-24

**25**  The woman saith unto him, I know that [[#^note-25a|Messias]] cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will [[#^note-25b|tell]] us all things. ^verse-25

**26**  Jesus saith unto her, [[#^note-26a|I]] that speak unto thee am he. ^verse-26

**27**  ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? ^verse-27

**28**  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, ^verse-28

**29**  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? ^verse-29

**30**  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. ^verse-30

**31**  ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. ^verse-31

**32**  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ^verse-32

**33**  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? ^verse-33

**34**  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the [[#^note-34a|will]] of him that sent me, and to finish his [[#^note-34b|work]]. ^verse-34

**35**  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the [[#^note-35a|fields]]; for they are white already to [[#^note-35b|harvest]]. ^verse-35

**36**  And he that reapeth receiveth [[#^note-36a|wages]], and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may [[#^note-36b|rejoice]] together. ^verse-36

**37**  And herein is that saying true, One [[#^note-37a|soweth]], and another reapeth. ^verse-37

**38**  I sent you to [[#^note-38a|reap]] that whereon ye bestowed no labour: [[#^note-38b|other men laboured]], and ye are entered into their labours. ^verse-38

**39**  ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. ^verse-39

**40**  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. ^verse-40

**41**  And many more believed because of his own word; ^verse-41

**42**  And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the [[#^note-42a|Christ]], the [[#^note-42b|Saviour]] of the world. ^verse-42

**43**  ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. ^verse-43

**44**  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. ^verse-44

**45**  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. ^verse-45

**46**  So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at [[#^note-46a|Capernaum]]. ^verse-46

**47**  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. ^verse-47

**48**  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see [[#^note-48a|signs]] and wonders, ye will not believe. ^verse-48

**49**  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. ^verse-49

**50**  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son [[#^note-50a|liveth]]. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. ^verse-50

**51**  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. ^verse-51

**52**  Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ^verse-52

**53**  So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and [[#^note-53a|himself]] believed, and his whole house. ^verse-53

**54**  This is again the [[#^note-54a|second]] miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee. ^verse-54
