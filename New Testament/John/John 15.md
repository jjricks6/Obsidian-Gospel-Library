### Chapter 15

[[New Testament/John/John 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/John/John 16|Next Entry]]

*Jesus is the vine; His disciples are the branches—He discourses on the perfect law of love—His servants have been chosen and ordained by Him—The world hates and fights true religion—He promises the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.*

**1**  I am the true [[#^note-1a|vine]], and my Father is the husbandman. ^verse-1

**2**  Every [[#^note-2a|branch]] in me that beareth not [[#^note-2b|fruit]] he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he [[#^note-2c|purgeth]] it, that it may bring forth more fruit. ^verse-2

**3**  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. ^verse-3

**4**    [[#^note-4a|Abide]] in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. ^verse-4

**5**  I am the [[#^note-5a|vine]], ye are the branches: He that abideth in [[#^note-5b|me]], and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. ^verse-5

**6**  If a man [[#^note-6a|abide]] not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. ^verse-6

**7**  If ye [[#^note-7a|abide]] in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall [[#^note-7b|ask]] what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. ^verse-7

**8**  Herein is my Father [[#^note-8a|glorified]], that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. ^verse-8

**9**  As the Father hath [[#^note-9a|loved]] me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. ^verse-9

**10**  If ye [[#^note-10a|keep]] my commandments, ye shall abide in my [[#^note-10b|love]]; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. ^verse-10

**11**  These things have I spoken unto you, that my [[#^note-11a|joy]] might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. ^verse-11

**12**  This is my commandment, That ye [[#^note-12a|love]] one another, as I have [[#^note-12b|loved]] you. ^verse-12

**13**  Greater [[#^note-13a|love]] hath no man than this, that a man lay down his [[#^note-13b|life]] for his [[#^note-13c|friends]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Ye are my [[#^note-14a|friends]], if ye do whatsoever I [[#^note-14b|command]] you. ^verse-14

**15**  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you [[#^note-15a|friends]]; for all things that I have [[#^note-15b|heard]] of my Father I have made [[#^note-15c|known]] unto you. ^verse-15

**16**    Ye have not [[#^note-16a|chosen]] me, but I have chosen you, and [[#^note-16b|ordained]] you, that ye should go and bring forth [[#^note-16c|fruit]], and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my [[#^note-16d|name]], he may give it you. ^verse-16

**17**  These things I command you, that ye love one another. ^verse-17

**18**  If the world [[#^note-18a|hate]] you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. ^verse-18

**19**  If ye were of the [[#^note-19a|world]], the world would [[#^note-19b|love]] his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. ^verse-19

**20**  Remember the word that I said unto you, The [[#^note-20a|servant]] is not greater than his lord. If they have [[#^note-20b|persecuted]] me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. ^verse-20

**21**  But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. ^verse-21

**22**  If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had [[#^note-22a|sin]]: but now they have no [[#^note-22b|cloak]] for their sin. ^verse-22

**23**  He that hateth me hateth my Father also. ^verse-23

**24**  If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had [[#^note-24a|sin]]: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. ^verse-24

**25**  But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They [[#^note-25a|hated]] me without a cause. ^verse-25

**26**  But when the [[#^note-26a|Comforter]] is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall [[#^note-26b|testify]] of me: ^verse-26

**27**  And ye also shall bear [[#^note-27a|witness]], because ye have been with me from the beginning. ^verse-27
