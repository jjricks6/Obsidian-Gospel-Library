*Paul describes the latter-day apostasyâ€”Christ is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.*

**1**  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the [[#^note-1a|latter times]] some shall [[#^note-1b|depart]] from the faith, giving heed to [[#^note-1c|seducing]] spirits, and [[#^note-1d|doctrines of devils]]; ^verse-1

**2**  Speaking [[#^note-2a|lies]] in [[#^note-2b|hypocrisy]]; having their [[#^note-2c|conscience]] seared with a hot iron; ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Forbidding]] to [[#^note-3b|marry]], and commanding to [[#^note-3c|abstain]] from [[#^note-3d|meats]], which God hath [[#^note-3e|created]] to be received with [[#^note-3f|thanksgiving]] of them which believe and know the truth. ^verse-3

**4**  For every [[#^note-4a|creature]] of God is [[#^note-4b|good]], and nothing to be refused, if it be received with [[#^note-4c|thanksgiving]]: ^verse-4

**5**  For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. ^verse-5

**6**  If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, [[#^note-6a|whereunto thou hast attained]]. ^verse-6

**7**  But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. ^verse-7

**8**  For bodily exercise profiteth [[#^note-8a|little]]: but [[#^note-8b|godliness]] is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. ^verse-8

**9**  This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. ^verse-9

**10**  For therefore we both [[#^note-10a|labour]] and suffer [[#^note-10b|reproach]], because we [[#^note-10c|trust]] in the living God, who is the [[#^note-10d|Saviour]] of all men, specially of those that [[#^note-10e|believe]]. ^verse-10

**11**  These things command and teach. ^verse-11

**12**  Let no man [[#^note-12a|despise]] thy youth; but be thou an [[#^note-12b|example]] of the believers, in word, in [[#^note-12c|conversation]], in charity, in spirit, in faith, in [[#^note-12d|purity]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Till I come, give attendance to [[#^note-13a|reading]], to exhortation, to doctrine. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Neglect]] not the [[#^note-14b|gift]] that is in thee, which was given thee by [[#^note-14c|prophecy]], with the [[#^note-14d|laying]] on of the [[#^note-14e|hands]] of the [[#^note-14f|presbytery]]. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Meditate]] upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy [[#^note-15b|profiting]] may [[#^note-15c|appear to all]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both [[#^note-16a|save]] thyself, and them that hear thee. ^verse-16
