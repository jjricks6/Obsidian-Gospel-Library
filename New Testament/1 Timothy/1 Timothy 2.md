### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 3|Next Entry]]

*We should pray for all people—Christ is our Mediator—Women should dress modestly—Women are blessed in childbearing and are admonished to continue in faith, charity, and holiness.*

**1**  I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; ^verse-1

**2**  For [[#^note-2a|kings]], and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and [[#^note-2b|peaceable]] [[#^note-2c|life]] in all godliness and [[#^note-2d|honesty]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Who]] [[#^note-4b|will have]] [[#^note-4c|all]] men to be [[#^note-4d|saved]], and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. ^verse-4

**5**  For there is [[#^note-5a|one God]], and one [[#^note-5b|mediator]] between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; ^verse-5

**6**  Who [[#^note-6a|gave]] himself a [[#^note-6b|ransom]] for all, to be [[#^note-6c|testified]] in due time. ^verse-6

**7**  Whereunto I am [[#^note-7a|ordained]] a [[#^note-7b|preacher]], and an [[#^note-7c|apostle]], (I speak the truth in Christ, and [[#^note-7d|lie]] not;) a teacher of the [[#^note-7e|Gentiles]] in faith and [[#^note-7f|verity]]. ^verse-7

**8**  I [[#^note-8a|will]] therefore that men [[#^note-8b|pray]] every where, lifting up holy [[#^note-8c|hands]], without wrath and [[#^note-8d|doubting]]. ^verse-8

**9**  In like manner also, that [[#^note-9a|women]] adorn themselves in [[#^note-9b|modest]] [[#^note-9c|apparel]], with [[#^note-9d|shamefacedness]] and sobriety; not with [[#^note-9e|broided]] hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; ^verse-9

**10**  But (which becometh women professing [[#^note-10a|godliness]]) with good works. ^verse-10

**11**  Let the woman learn in [[#^note-11a|silence]] with all subjection. ^verse-11

**12**  But I suffer not a woman to [[#^note-12a|teach]], nor to [[#^note-12b|usurp authority]] over the man, but to be in [[#^note-12c|silence]]. ^verse-12

**13**  For Adam was first [[#^note-13a|formed]], then Eve. ^verse-13

**14**  And Adam was not [[#^note-14a|deceived]], but the woman being deceived was in the [[#^note-14b|transgression]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Notwithstanding [[#^note-15a|she]] shall be saved in [[#^note-15b|childbearing]], if they continue in faith and charity and [[#^note-15c|holiness]] with [[#^note-15d|sobriety]]. ^verse-15
