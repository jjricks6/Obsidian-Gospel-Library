# The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy

### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/1 Timothy|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 2|Next Entry]]

*Counsel is given to teach true doctrine only—Christ came to save repentant sinners.*

**1**  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; ^verse-1

**2**  Unto [[#^note-2a|Timothy]], [[#^note-2b|my]] [[#^note-2c|own]] son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. ^verse-2

**3**  As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they [[#^note-3a|teach]] no [[#^note-3b|other]] doctrine, ^verse-3

**4**  Neither give heed to [[#^note-4a|fables]] and endless genealogies, which [[#^note-4b|minister]] [[#^note-4c|questions]], rather than godly [[#^note-4d|edifying]] which is in faith: so do. ^verse-4

**5**  Now the end of the [[#^note-5a|commandment]] is [[#^note-5b|charity]] out of a [[#^note-5c|pure]] heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: ^verse-5

**6**  From which some having [[#^note-6a|swerved]] have [[#^note-6b|turned]] aside unto [[#^note-6c|vain jangling]]; ^verse-6

**7**  Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they [[#^note-7a|affirm]]. ^verse-7

**8**  But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; ^verse-8

**9**  Knowing this, that the [[#^note-9a|law]] is not made for a [[#^note-9b|righteous]] man, but for the [[#^note-9c|lawless]] and [[#^note-9d|disobedient]], for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, ^verse-9

**10**  For [[#^note-10a|whoremongers]], for [[#^note-10b|them]] that [[#^note-10c|defile]] themselves with mankind, for [[#^note-10d|menstealers]], for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound [[#^note-10e|doctrine]]; ^verse-10

**11**  According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my [[#^note-11a|trust]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath [[#^note-12a|enabled]] me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; ^verse-12

**13**  Who was before a [[#^note-13a|blasphemer]], and a [[#^note-13b|persecutor]], and [[#^note-13c|injurious]]: but I obtained [[#^note-13d|mercy]], because I did it [[#^note-13e|ignorantly]] in unbelief. ^verse-13

**14**  And the [[#^note-14a|grace]] of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. ^verse-14

**15**  This is a faithful [[#^note-15a|saying]], and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to [[#^note-15b|save]] [[#^note-15c|sinners]]; of whom I am chief. ^verse-15

**16**  Howbeit for this cause I obtained [[#^note-16a|mercy]], that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all [[#^note-16b|longsuffering]], for a [[#^note-16c|pattern]] to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. ^verse-16

**17**  Now unto the [[#^note-17a|King]] eternal, [[#^note-17b|immortal]], invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-17

**18**  This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the [[#^note-18a|prophecies]] which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Holding]] faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made [[#^note-19b|shipwreck]]: ^verse-19

**20**  Of whom is [[#^note-20a|Hymenæus]] and [[#^note-20b|Alexander]]; whom I have [[#^note-20c|delivered]] unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. ^verse-20
