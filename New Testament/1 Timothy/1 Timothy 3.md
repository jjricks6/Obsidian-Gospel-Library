*Qualifications are given for bishops and deaconsâ€”Great is the mystery of godliness.*

**1**  This is a true [[#^note-1a|saying]], If a man desire the office of a [[#^note-1b|bishop]], he desireth a good work. ^verse-1

**2**  A bishop then must be [[#^note-2a|blameless]], the husband of one wife, vigilant, [[#^note-2b|sober]], of good behaviour, given to [[#^note-2c|hospitality]], apt to [[#^note-2d|teach]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Not given to [[#^note-3a|wine]], no [[#^note-3b|striker]], not greedy of [[#^note-3c|filthy]] lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; ^verse-3

**4**  One that [[#^note-4a|ruleth]] well his own [[#^note-4b|house]], having his [[#^note-4c|children]] in subjection with all gravity; ^verse-4

**5**  (For if a man know not how to [[#^note-5a|rule]] his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) ^verse-5

**6**  Not a [[#^note-6a|novice]], lest being lifted up with [[#^note-6b|pride]] he fall into the [[#^note-6c|condemnation]] of the devil. ^verse-6

**7**  Moreover he must have a good [[#^note-7a|report]] of them which are [[#^note-7b|without]]; lest he fall into reproach and the [[#^note-7c|snare]] of the devil. ^verse-7

**8**  Likewise must the [[#^note-8a|deacons]] be [[#^note-8b|grave]], not [[#^note-8c|doubletongued]], not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; ^verse-8

**9**  Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure [[#^note-9a|conscience]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And let these also first be [[#^note-10a|proved]]; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Even]] so must their [[#^note-11b|wives]] be [[#^note-11c|grave]], not [[#^note-11d|slanderers]], [[#^note-11e|sober]], [[#^note-11f|faithful]] in all things. ^verse-11

**12**  Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. ^verse-12

**13**  For they that have used the office of a deacon well [[#^note-13a|purchase]] to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. ^verse-13

**14**  These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|But]] if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the [[#^note-15b|church]] of the living God, the pillar and [[#^note-15c|ground]] of the [[#^note-15d|truth]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And without controversy great is the [[#^note-16a|mystery]] of godliness: [[#^note-16b|God]] was [[#^note-16c|manifest]] in the [[#^note-16d|flesh]], [[#^note-16e|justified in the]] Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, [[#^note-16f|received]] up into glory. ^verse-16
