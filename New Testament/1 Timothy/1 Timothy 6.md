### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Timothy|Next Entry]]

*The love of money is the root of all evil—Fight the good fight of faith—Do not trust in worldly riches.*

**1**  Let as many [[#^note-1a|servants]] as are under the [[#^note-1b|yoke]] count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. ^verse-1

**2**  And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are [[#^note-2a|brethren]]; but rather do them [[#^note-2b|service]], because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. ^verse-2

**3**  If any man [[#^note-3a|teach]] otherwise, and consent not to [[#^note-3b|wholesome]] words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; ^verse-3

**4**  He is [[#^note-4a|proud]], knowing nothing, but [[#^note-4b|doting]] about [[#^note-4c|questions]] and [[#^note-4d|strifes]] of words, whereof cometh [[#^note-4e|envy]], strife, railings, [[#^note-4f|evil surmisings]], ^verse-4

**5**  Perverse [[#^note-5a|disputings]] of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that [[#^note-5b|gain]] is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. ^verse-5

**6**  But [[#^note-6a|godliness]] with [[#^note-6b|contentment]] is great gain. ^verse-6

**7**  For we brought [[#^note-7a|nothing]] into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. ^verse-7

**8**  And having [[#^note-8a|food]] and raiment let us be therewith [[#^note-8b|content]]. ^verse-8

**9**  But [[#^note-9a|they]] that will be [[#^note-9b|rich]] fall into [[#^note-9c|temptation]] and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful [[#^note-9d|lusts]], which drown men in destruction and [[#^note-9e|perdition]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For the [[#^note-10a|love]] of [[#^note-10b|money]] is the root of all evil: which while some [[#^note-10c|coveted]] after, they have [[#^note-10d|erred]] from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many [[#^note-10e|sorrows]]. ^verse-10

**11**  But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after [[#^note-11a|righteousness]], godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. ^verse-11

**12**  Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on [[#^note-12a|eternal life]], whereunto thou art also called, and hast [[#^note-12b|professed]] a good profession before many witnesses. ^verse-12

**13**  I give thee charge in the sight of God, who [[#^note-13a|quickeneth]] all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before [[#^note-13b|Pontius Pilate]] [[#^note-13c|witnessed a good confession]]; ^verse-13

**14**  That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Which]] in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only [[#^note-15b|Potentate]], the [[#^note-15c|King of kings]], and Lord of lords; ^verse-15

**16**  Who only hath [[#^note-16a|immortality]], dwelling in the [[#^note-16b|light]] which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath [[#^note-16c|seen]], nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. ^verse-16

**17**  Charge them that are [[#^note-17a|rich]] in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain [[#^note-17b|riches]], but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; ^verse-17

**18**  That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to [[#^note-18a|distribute]], willing to [[#^note-18b|communicate]]; ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Laying]] up in [[#^note-19b|store]] for themselves a good foundation [[#^note-19c|against]] the time to come, that they may lay hold on [[#^note-19d|eternal life]]. ^verse-19

**20**  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy [[#^note-20a|trust]], avoiding profane and vain babblings, and [[#^note-20b|oppositions]] of science falsely so called: ^verse-20

**21**  Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. ^verse-21
