### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Timothy/1 Timothy 6|Next Entry]]

*Saints are to care for their worthy poorâ€”Policies concerning elders are given.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Rebuke]] not an elder, but [[#^note-1b|entreat]] him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; ^verse-1

**2**  The elder women as mothers; the younger as [[#^note-2a|sisters]], with all purity. ^verse-2

**3**  Honour [[#^note-3a|widows]] that are widows indeed. ^verse-3

**4**  But if any widow have [[#^note-4a|children]] or [[#^note-4b|nephews]], let them learn first to shew [[#^note-4c|piety]] at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. ^verse-4

**5**  Now she that is a widow indeed, and [[#^note-5a|desolate]], trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. ^verse-5

**6**  But she that liveth [[#^note-6a|in]] [[#^note-6b|pleasure]] is dead while she liveth. ^verse-6

**7**  And these things [[#^note-7a|give in charge]], that they may be blameless. ^verse-7

**8**  But if any [[#^note-8a|provide]] not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. ^verse-8

**9**  Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years [[#^note-9a|old]], having been the wife of one man, ^verse-9

**10**  Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have [[#^note-10a|lodged]] strangers, if she have [[#^note-10b|washed]] the saints' [[#^note-10c|feet]], if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. ^verse-10

**11**  But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; ^verse-11

**12**  Having [[#^note-12a|damnation]], because they have cast off their first faith. ^verse-12

**13**  And withal they learn to be [[#^note-13a|idle]], wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and [[#^note-13b|busybodies]], speaking things which they ought not. ^verse-13

**14**  I [[#^note-14a|will]] therefore that the younger [[#^note-14b|women]] marry, bear [[#^note-14c|children]], guide the [[#^note-14d|house]], give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. ^verse-14

**15**  For some are already turned aside after Satan. ^verse-15

**16**  If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them [[#^note-16a|relieve]] them, and let not the church be [[#^note-16b|charged]]; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. ^verse-16

**17**  Let the [[#^note-17a|elders]] that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. ^verse-17

**18**  For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not [[#^note-18a|muzzle]] the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The [[#^note-18b|labourer]] is worthy of his [[#^note-18c|reward]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three [[#^note-19a|witnesses]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Them that sin [[#^note-20a|rebuke]] before all, that others also may fear. ^verse-20

**21**  I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect [[#^note-21a|angels]], that thou observe these things [[#^note-21b|without]] preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. ^verse-21

**22**  [[#^note-22a|Lay]] [[#^note-22b|hands]] suddenly on no [[#^note-22c|man]], neither be [[#^note-22d|partaker]] of other men's sins: keep thyself [[#^note-22e|pure]]. ^verse-22

**23**  Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. ^verse-23

**24**  Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they [[#^note-24a|follow after]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. ^verse-25
