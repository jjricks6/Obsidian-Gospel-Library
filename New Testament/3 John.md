### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/2 John|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Jude|Next Entry]]

*John commends Gaius for his help to those who love the truth.*

**1**  The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. ^verse-1

**2**  Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. ^verse-2

**3**  For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. ^verse-3

**4**  I have no greater [[#^note-4a|joy]] than to hear that my [[#^note-4b|children]] [[#^note-4c|walk]] in truth. ^verse-4

**5**  Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the [[#^note-5a|brethren]], and to [[#^note-5b|strangers]]; ^verse-5

**6**  Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: ^verse-6

**7**  Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. ^verse-7

**8**  We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. ^verse-8

**9**  I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the [[#^note-9a|preeminence]] among them, [[#^note-9b|receiveth]] us not. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, [[#^note-10a|prating]] against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. ^verse-10

**11**  Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is [[#^note-11a|good]]. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. ^verse-11

**12**  Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear [[#^note-12a|record]]; and ye know that our record is true. ^verse-12

**13**  I had many things to [[#^note-13a|write]], but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: ^verse-13

**14**  But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. ^verse-14
