[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 11|Next Entry]]

*Bring every thought into obedienceâ€”Paul glories in the Lord.*

**1**  Now I Paul myself beseech you by the [[#^note-1a|meekness]] and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: ^verse-1

**2**  But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. ^verse-2

**3**  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not [[#^note-3a|war]] after the flesh: ^verse-3

**4**  (For the [[#^note-4a|weapons]] of our [[#^note-4b|warfare]] are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) ^verse-4

**5**  Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every [[#^note-5a|thought]] to the [[#^note-5b|obedience]] of Christ; ^verse-5

**6**  And having in a readiness to revenge all [[#^note-6a|disobedience]], when your [[#^note-6b|obedience]] is fulfilled. ^verse-6

**7**  Do ye look on things after the outward [[#^note-7a|appearance]]? If any man trust to himself that he is [[#^note-7b|Christ's]], let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. ^verse-7

**8**  For though I should boast somewhat more of our [[#^note-8a|authority]], which the Lord hath given us for [[#^note-8b|edification]], and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: ^verse-8

**9**  That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. ^verse-9

**10**  For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his [[#^note-10a|bodily]] presence is weak, and his speech [[#^note-10b|contemptible]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. ^verse-11

**12**  For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. ^verse-12

**13**  But we will not [[#^note-13a|boast]] of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. ^verse-13

**14**  For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: ^verse-14

**15**  Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's [[#^note-15a|labours]]; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, ^verse-15

**16**  To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. ^verse-16

**17**  But he that glorieth, let him [[#^note-17a|glory]] in the Lord. ^verse-17

**18**  For not he that [[#^note-18a|commendeth]] himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. ^verse-18
