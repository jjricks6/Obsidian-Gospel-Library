### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 6|Next Entry]]

*Saints walk by faith and seek tabernacles of immortal glory—The gospel reconciles man to God—God's ministers carry the word of reconciliation to the world.*

**1**  For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. ^verse-1

**2**  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be [[#^note-2a|clothed]] upon with our house which is from heaven: ^verse-2

**3**  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. ^verse-3

**4**  For we that are in this tabernacle do [[#^note-4a|groan]], being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that [[#^note-4b|mortality]] might be swallowed up of life. ^verse-4

**5**  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. ^verse-5

**6**  Therefore we are always [[#^note-6a|confident]], knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: ^verse-6

**7**  (For we walk by [[#^note-7a|faith]], not by [[#^note-7b|sight]]:) ^verse-7

**8**  We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore we [[#^note-9a|labour]], that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. ^verse-9

**10**  For we must all appear before the [[#^note-10a|judgment]] seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, [[#^note-10b|according]] to that he hath [[#^note-10c|done]], whether it be good or bad. ^verse-10

**11**  Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your [[#^note-11a|consciences]]. ^verse-11

**12**  For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|For]] whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. ^verse-13

**14**  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if [[#^note-14a|one]] [[#^note-14b|died]] for all, then were all dead: ^verse-14

**15**  And that he died for all, that they which [[#^note-15a|live]] should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Wherefore]] henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. ^verse-16

**17**    Therefore if any man be [[#^note-17a|in Christ]], he is a [[#^note-17b|new]] creature: [[#^note-17c|old]] things are [[#^note-17d|passed]] away; behold, all things are become [[#^note-17e|new]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And all things are of God, who hath [[#^note-18a|reconciled]] us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; ^verse-18

**19**  To wit, that God was in Christ, [[#^note-19a|reconciling]] the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. ^verse-19

**20**  Now then we are [[#^note-20a|ambassadors]] for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. ^verse-20

**21**  For he hath made him to be [[#^note-21a|sin]] for us, who knew no [[#^note-21b|sin]]; that we might be made the [[#^note-21c|righteousness]] of God in him. ^verse-21
