*God loves and rewards a cheerful giverâ€”Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift.*

**1**  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: ^verse-1

**2**  For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I [[#^note-2a|boast]] of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath [[#^note-2b|provoked]] very many. ^verse-2

**3**  Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: ^verse-3

**4**  Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your [[#^note-5a|bounty]], whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness. ^verse-5

**6**  But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall [[#^note-6a|reap]] also sparingly; and he which [[#^note-6b|soweth]] bountifully shall reap also bountifully. ^verse-6

**7**  Every man according as he [[#^note-7a|purposeth]] in his heart, so let him give; not [[#^note-7b|grudgingly]], or of necessity: for God loveth a [[#^note-7c|cheerful]] [[#^note-7d|giver]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And God is able to make all [[#^note-8a|grace]] abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: ^verse-8

**9**  (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. ^verse-9

**10**  Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your [[#^note-10a|righteousness]];) ^verse-10

**11**  Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us [[#^note-11a|thanksgiving]] to God. ^verse-11

**12**  For the [[#^note-12a|administration]] of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; ^verse-12

**13**  Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; ^verse-13

**14**  And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. ^verse-14

**15**  [[#^note-15a|Thanks]] be unto God for his unspeakable [[#^note-15b|gift]]. ^verse-15
