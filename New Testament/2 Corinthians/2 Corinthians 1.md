### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 2|Next Entry]]

*God comforts and cares for His Saints—The Saints are sealed and given assurance by the Spirit in their hearts.*

**1**  Paul, an [[#^note-1a|apostle]] of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: ^verse-1

**2**  Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of [[#^note-3a|mercies]], and the God of all [[#^note-3b|comfort]]; ^verse-3

**4**  Who comforteth us in all our [[#^note-4a|tribulation]], that we may be able to [[#^note-4b|comfort]] them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. ^verse-4

**5**  For as the [[#^note-5a|sufferings]] of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is [[#^note-6a|effectual]] in the [[#^note-6b|enduring]] of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. ^verse-6

**7**  And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the [[#^note-7a|sufferings]], so shall ye be also of the consolation. ^verse-7

**8**  For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we [[#^note-8a|despaired]] even of life: ^verse-8

**9**  But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which [[#^note-9a|raiseth]] the dead: ^verse-9

**10**  Who [[#^note-10a|delivered]] us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; ^verse-10

**11**  Ye also helping together by [[#^note-11a|prayer]] for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. ^verse-11

**12**  For our rejoicing is this, the [[#^note-12a|testimony]] of our conscience, that in [[#^note-12b|simplicity]] and godly sincerity, not with fleshly [[#^note-12c|wisdom]], but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. ^verse-12

**13**  For we [[#^note-13a|write]] none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; ^verse-13

**14**  As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the [[#^note-14a|day]] of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-14

**15**  And in this confidence I was minded to [[#^note-15a|come]] unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; ^verse-15

**16**  And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judæa. ^verse-16

**17**  When I therefore was thus minded, did I use [[#^note-17a|lightness]]? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? ^verse-17

**18**  But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. ^verse-18

**19**  For the [[#^note-19a|Son of God]], Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and [[#^note-19b|Silvanus]] and [[#^note-19c|Timotheus]], was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. ^verse-19

**20**  For all the [[#^note-20a|promises]] of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. ^verse-20

**21**  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath [[#^note-21a|anointed]] us, is God; ^verse-21

**22**  Who hath also [[#^note-22a|sealed]] us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. ^verse-22

**23**  Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. ^verse-23

**24**  Not for that we have dominion over your [[#^note-24a|faith]], but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. ^verse-24
