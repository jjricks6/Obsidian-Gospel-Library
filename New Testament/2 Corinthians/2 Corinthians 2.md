*Saints should love and forgive one anotherâ€”They always triumph in Christ.*

**1**  But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. ^verse-1

**2**  For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? ^verse-2

**3**  And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having [[#^note-3a|confidence]] in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. ^verse-3

**4**  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. ^verse-4

**5**  But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. ^verse-5

**6**  Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. ^verse-6

**7**  So that contrariwise ye ought rather to [[#^note-7a|forgive]] him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. ^verse-8

**9**  For to this end also did I [[#^note-9a|write]], that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be [[#^note-9b|obedient]] in all things. ^verse-9

**10**  To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the [[#^note-10a|person]] of Christ; ^verse-10

**11**  Lest [[#^note-11a|Satan]] should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. ^verse-11

**12**  Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a [[#^note-12a|door]] was opened unto me of the Lord, ^verse-12

**13**  I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. ^verse-13

**14**  Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to [[#^note-14a|triumph]] in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. ^verse-14

**15**  For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: ^verse-15

**16**  To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is [[#^note-16a|sufficient]] for these things? ^verse-16

**17**  For we are not as many, which [[#^note-17a|corrupt]] the [[#^note-17b|word]] of God: but as of [[#^note-17c|sincerity]], but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. ^verse-17
