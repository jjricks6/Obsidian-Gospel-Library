### Chapter 13

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Galations|Next Entry]]

*Saints should test themselves as to righteousnessâ€”Be perfect and of one mind; live in peace.*

**1**  This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three [[#^note-1a|witnesses]] shall every word be established. ^verse-1

**2**  I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: ^verse-2

**3**  Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. ^verse-3

**4**  For though he was [[#^note-4a|crucified]] through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Examine]] yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that [[#^note-5b|Jesus]] [[#^note-5c|Christ]] is in you, except ye be reprobates? ^verse-5

**6**  But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. ^verse-6

**7**  Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is [[#^note-7a|honest]], though we be as reprobates. ^verse-7

**8**  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. ^verse-8

**9**  For we are glad, when we are [[#^note-9a|weak]], and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the [[#^note-10a|power]] which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. ^verse-10

**11**  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be [[#^note-11a|perfect]], be of good comfort, be of [[#^note-11b|one]] [[#^note-11c|mind]], live in [[#^note-11d|peace]]; and the God of [[#^note-11e|love]] and peace shall be with you. ^verse-11

**12**  Greet one another with an holy [[#^note-12a|kiss]]. ^verse-12

**13**  All the saints salute you. ^verse-13

**14**  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen. ^verse-14
