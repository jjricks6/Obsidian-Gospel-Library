### Chapter 3

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 4|Next Entry]]

*The gospel surpasses the law of Mosesâ€”Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.*

**1**  Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? ^verse-1

**2**  Ye are our [[#^note-2a|epistle]] written in our hearts, known and read of all men: ^verse-2

**3**  Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, [[#^note-3a|written]] not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in [[#^note-3b|tables]] of stone, but in [[#^note-3c|fleshy]] tables of the [[#^note-3d|heart]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: ^verse-4

**5**  Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our [[#^note-5a|sufficiency]] is of God; ^verse-5

**6**  Who also hath made us able [[#^note-6a|ministers]] of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the [[#^note-6b|spirit]]: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. ^verse-6

**7**  But if the ministration of [[#^note-7a|death]], written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the [[#^note-7b|glory]] of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: ^verse-7

**8**  How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? ^verse-8

**9**  For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. ^verse-9

**10**  For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. ^verse-10

**11**  For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. ^verse-11

**12**  Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great [[#^note-12a|plainness]] of speech: ^verse-12

**13**  And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: ^verse-13

**14**  But their [[#^note-14a|minds]] were [[#^note-14b|blinded]]: for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the [[#^note-14c|reading]] of the old testament; which [[#^note-14d|veil]] is done away in Christ. ^verse-14

**15**  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their [[#^note-15a|heart]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. ^verse-16

**17**  Now the Lord is [[#^note-17a|that Spirit]]: and where the [[#^note-17b|Spirit]] of the Lord is, there is [[#^note-17c|liberty]]. ^verse-17

**18**  But we all, with open face beholding as in a [[#^note-18a|glass]] the [[#^note-18b|glory]] of the Lord, are changed into the same [[#^note-18c|image]] from [[#^note-18d|glory]] to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. ^verse-18
