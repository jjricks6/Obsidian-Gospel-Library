### Chapter 12

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 13|Next Entry]]

*Paul is caught up to the third heaven—The Lord gives men weaknesses that they may triumph over them—Paul manifests the signs of an Apostle.*

**1**  It is not expedient for me doubtless to [[#^note-1a|glory]]. I will come to [[#^note-1b|visions]] and [[#^note-1c|revelations]] of the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|I]] knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the [[#^note-2b|body]], I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the [[#^note-2c|third]] [[#^note-2d|heaven]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) ^verse-3

**4**  How that he was caught up into [[#^note-4a|paradise]], and heard [[#^note-4b|unspeakable]] words, which it is [[#^note-4c|not]] [[#^note-4d|lawful]] for a man to utter. ^verse-4

**5**  Of such an one will I [[#^note-5a|glory]]: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. ^verse-5

**6**  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. ^verse-6

**7**  And lest I should be [[#^note-7a|exalted]] above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a [[#^note-7b|thorn]] in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. ^verse-7

**8**  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. ^verse-8

**9**  And he said unto me, My [[#^note-9a|grace]] is sufficient for thee: for my [[#^note-9b|strength]] is made perfect in [[#^note-9c|weakness]]. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may [[#^note-9d|rest]] upon me. ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore I take pleasure in [[#^note-10a|infirmities]], in reproaches, in necessities, in [[#^note-10b|persecutions]], in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am [[#^note-10c|weak]], then am I [[#^note-10d|strong]]. ^verse-10

**11**  I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very [[#^note-11a|chiefest]] apostles, though I be nothing. ^verse-11

**12**  Truly the [[#^note-12a|signs]] of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. ^verse-12

**13**  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not [[#^note-13a|burdensome]] to you? forgive me this wrong. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I [[#^note-14a|seek]] not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. ^verse-14

**15**  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. ^verse-15

**16**  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. ^verse-16

**17**  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? ^verse-17

**18**  I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps? ^verse-18

**19**  Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your [[#^note-19a|edifying]]. ^verse-19

**20**  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, [[#^note-20a|strifes]], [[#^note-20b|backbitings]], whisperings, swellings, [[#^note-20c|tumults]]: ^verse-20

**21**  And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed. ^verse-21
