[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 5|Next Entry]]

*Gospel light shines on the Saintsâ€”Mortal trials are nothing as contrasted with eternal glory.*

**1**  Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received [[#^note-1a|mercy]], we faint not; ^verse-1

**2**  But have [[#^note-2a|renounced]] the hidden things of [[#^note-2b|dishonesty]], not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God [[#^note-2c|deceitfully]]; but by manifestation of the [[#^note-2d|truth]] commending ourselves to every man's [[#^note-2e|conscience]] in the sight of God. ^verse-2

**3**  But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: ^verse-3

**4**  In whom the [[#^note-4a|god]] of this [[#^note-4b|world]] hath [[#^note-4c|blinded]] the [[#^note-4d|minds]] of them which [[#^note-4e|believe not]], lest the [[#^note-4f|light]] of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the [[#^note-4g|image]] of [[#^note-4h|God]], should shine unto them. ^verse-4

**5**  For we [[#^note-5a|preach]] not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your [[#^note-5b|servants]] for Jesus' sake. ^verse-5

**6**  For God, who [[#^note-6a|commanded]] the light to shine out of darkness, hath [[#^note-6b|shined]] in our hearts, to give the [[#^note-6c|light]] of the knowledge of the [[#^note-6d|glory]] of God in the face of Jesus Christ. ^verse-6

**7**  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the [[#^note-7a|power]] may be of God, and not of us. ^verse-7

**8**  We are [[#^note-8a|troubled]] on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in [[#^note-8b|despair]]; ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Persecuted]], but not forsaken; cast down, but not [[#^note-9b|destroyed]]; ^verse-9

**10**  Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. ^verse-10

**11**  For we which live are alway delivered unto [[#^note-11a|death]] for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our [[#^note-11b|mortal]] flesh. ^verse-11

**12**  So then death worketh in us, but life in you. ^verse-12

**13**  We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I [[#^note-13a|believed]], and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore [[#^note-13b|speak]]; ^verse-13

**14**  Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. ^verse-14

**15**  For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the [[#^note-15a|thanksgiving]] of many redound to the glory of God. ^verse-15

**16**  For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the [[#^note-16a|inward]] man is renewed day by day. ^verse-16

**17**  For our light [[#^note-17a|affliction]], which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and [[#^note-17b|eternal]] [[#^note-17c|weight]] of glory; ^verse-17

**18**  While we look not at the things which are [[#^note-18a|seen]], but at the things which are not [[#^note-18b|seen]]: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are [[#^note-18c|eternal]]. ^verse-18
