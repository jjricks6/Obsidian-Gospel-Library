### Chapter 6

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 7|Next Entry]]

*Now is the day of salvation—God's ministers must walk uprightly and bear all things—Saints should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.*

**1**  We then, as [[#^note-1a|workers]] together with [[#^note-1b|him]], beseech you also that ye receive not the [[#^note-1c|grace]] of God in vain. ^verse-1

**2**  (For he saith, I have heard thee in a [[#^note-2a|time]] accepted, and in the [[#^note-2b|day]] of [[#^note-2c|salvation]] have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) ^verse-2

**3**  Giving no [[#^note-3a|offence]] in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: ^verse-3

**4**  But in all things approving ourselves as the [[#^note-4a|ministers]] of God, in much [[#^note-4b|patience]], in [[#^note-4c|afflictions]], in necessities, in distresses, ^verse-4

**5**  In stripes, in imprisonments, in [[#^note-5a|tumults]], in labours, in watchings, in fastings; ^verse-5

**6**  By [[#^note-6a|pureness]], by knowledge, by [[#^note-6b|longsuffering]], by [[#^note-6c|kindness]], by the Holy Ghost, by [[#^note-6d|love]] unfeigned, ^verse-6

**7**  By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the [[#^note-7a|armour]] of [[#^note-7b|righteousness]] on the right hand and on the left, ^verse-7

**8**  By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; ^verse-8

**9**  As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; ^verse-9

**10**  As [[#^note-10a|sorrowful]], yet alway rejoicing; as [[#^note-10b|poor]], yet making many [[#^note-10c|rich]]; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. ^verse-10

**11**  O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is [[#^note-11a|enlarged]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own [[#^note-12a|bowels]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged. ^verse-13

**14**  Be ye not unequally [[#^note-14a|yoked]] together with unbelievers: for what [[#^note-14b|fellowship]] hath righteousness with [[#^note-14c|unrighteousness]]? and what communion hath [[#^note-14d|light]] with darkness? ^verse-14

**15**  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? ^verse-15

**16**  And what [[#^note-16a|agreement]] hath the [[#^note-16b|temple]] of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will [[#^note-16c|dwell]] in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore [[#^note-17a|come]] out from among them, and be ye [[#^note-17b|separate]], saith the Lord, and touch not the [[#^note-17c|unclean thing]]; and I will receive you, ^verse-17

**18**  And will be a [[#^note-18a|Father]] unto you, and ye shall be my [[#^note-18b|sons]] and daughters, saith the Lord [[#^note-18c|Almighty]]. ^verse-18
