### Chapter 11

[[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 10|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 12|Next Entry]]

*Maintain the simplicity that is in Christ—Satan sends forth false apostles—Paul glories in his sufferings for Christ.*

**1**  Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. ^verse-1

**2**  For I am [[#^note-2a|jealous]] over you with godly jealousy: for I have [[#^note-2b|espoused]] you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  But I fear, lest by any means, as the [[#^note-3a|serpent]] [[#^note-3b|beguiled]] Eve through his [[#^note-3c|subtilty]], so your minds should be [[#^note-3d|corrupted]] from the [[#^note-3e|simplicity]] that is in Christ. ^verse-3

**4**  For if he that cometh preacheth another [[#^note-4a|Jesus]], whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another [[#^note-4b|gospel]], which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. ^verse-4

**5**  For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. ^verse-5

**6**  But though I be [[#^note-6a|rude]] in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. ^verse-6

**7**  Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God [[#^note-7a|freely]]? ^verse-7

**8**  I [[#^note-8a|robbed other churches]], taking [[#^note-8b|wages]] of them, to do you service. ^verse-8

**9**  And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was [[#^note-9a|chargeable]] to no man: for that which was [[#^note-9b|lacking]] to me the brethren which came from Macedonia [[#^note-9c|supplied]]: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. ^verse-9

**10**  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. ^verse-11

**12**  But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they [[#^note-12a|glory]], they may be found even as we. ^verse-12

**13**  For such are [[#^note-13a|false apostles]], deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. ^verse-13

**14**  And no marvel; for [[#^note-14a|Satan]] himself is transformed into an [[#^note-14b|angel]] of light. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose [[#^note-15a|end]] shall be according to their works. ^verse-15

**16**  I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool [[#^note-16a|receive]] me, that I may [[#^note-16b|boast]] myself a little. ^verse-16

**17**  That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. ^verse-17

**18**  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. ^verse-18

**19**  For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. ^verse-19

**20**  For ye suffer, if a man bring you into [[#^note-20a|bondage]], if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. ^verse-20

**21**  I speak as concerning [[#^note-21a|reproach]], as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. ^verse-21

**22**  Are they [[#^note-22a|Hebrews]]? so am I. Are they [[#^note-22b|Israelites]]? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. ^verse-22

**23**  Are they [[#^note-23a|ministers]] of Christ? ([[#^note-23b|I]] speak as a fool) I am more; in [[#^note-23c|labours]] more abundant, in [[#^note-23d|stripes]] above measure, in [[#^note-23e|prisons]] more frequent, in deaths oft. ^verse-23

**24**  Of the Jews five times received I [[#^note-24a|forty]] stripes save one. ^verse-24

**25**  Thrice was I [[#^note-25a|beaten]] with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; ^verse-25

**26**  In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own [[#^note-26a|countrymen]], in perils by the [[#^note-26b|heathen]], in [[#^note-26c|perils]] in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; ^verse-26

**27**  In [[#^note-27a|weariness]] and [[#^note-27b|painfulness]], in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. ^verse-27

**28**  Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. ^verse-28

**29**  Who is [[#^note-29a|weak]], and I am not weak? who is offended, and I [[#^note-29b|burn not]]? ^verse-29

**30**  If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. ^verse-30

**31**  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. ^verse-31

**32**  In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to [[#^note-32a|apprehend]] me: ^verse-32

**33**  And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. ^verse-33
