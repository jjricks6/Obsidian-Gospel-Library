### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/James/James 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/1 Peter|Next Entry]]

*Misery awaits the wanton rich—Await the Lord's coming with patience—The elders are to anoint and heal the sick.*

**1**  Go to now, ye rich men, [[#^note-1a|weep]] and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. ^verse-1

**2**  Your [[#^note-2a|riches]] are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. ^verse-2

**3**  Your [[#^note-3a|gold]] and silver is [[#^note-3b|cankered]]; and the [[#^note-3c|rust]] of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, the [[#^note-4a|hire]] of the [[#^note-4b|labourers]] who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. ^verse-4

**5**  Ye have lived [[#^note-5a|in pleasure]] on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. ^verse-5

**6**  Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. ^verse-6

**7**  Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. ^verse-7

**8**  Be ye also [[#^note-8a|patient]]; [[#^note-8b|stablish]] your hearts: for the [[#^note-8c|coming]] of the Lord draweth nigh. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Grudge]] not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. ^verse-9

**10**  Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an [[#^note-10a|example]] of [[#^note-10b|suffering]] affliction, and of patience. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, we count them [[#^note-11a|happy]] which [[#^note-11b|endure]]. Ye have heard of the patience of [[#^note-11c|Job]], and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very [[#^note-11d|pitiful]], and of tender [[#^note-11e|mercy]]. ^verse-11

**12**  But above all things, my brethren, [[#^note-12a|swear]] not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other [[#^note-12b|oath]]: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. ^verse-12

**13**  Is any among you [[#^note-13a|afflicted]]? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. ^verse-13

**14**  Is any [[#^note-14a|sick]] among you? let him call for the [[#^note-14b|elders]] of the church; and let them [[#^note-14c|pray]] over him, [[#^note-14d|anointing]] him with oil in the name of the Lord: ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|prayer]] of [[#^note-15b|faith]] shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be [[#^note-15c|forgiven]] him. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Confess]] your faults one to another, and [[#^note-16b|pray]] one for another, that ye may be healed. [[#^note-16c|The]] effectual [[#^note-16d|fervent]] [[#^note-16e|prayer]] of a righteous man availeth much. ^verse-16

**17**  Elias was a man subject to like [[#^note-17a|passions]] as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it [[#^note-17b|rained]] not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. ^verse-17

**18**  And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. ^verse-18

**19**  Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; ^verse-19

**20**  Let him know, that he which [[#^note-20a|converteth]] the sinner from the error of his way shall [[#^note-20b|save]] a soul from death, and shall [[#^note-20c|hide]] a multitude of sins. ^verse-20
