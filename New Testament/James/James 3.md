[[New Testament/James/James 2|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/James/James 4|Next Entry]]

*By governing the tongue, we gain perfectionâ€”Heavenly wisdom is pure, peaceable, and full of mercy.*

**1**    My brethren, [[#^note-1a|be]] not many [[#^note-1b|masters]], knowing that we shall [[#^note-1c|receive]] the greater condemnation. ^verse-1

**2**  For in many things we [[#^note-2a|offend all]]. If any man [[#^note-2b|offend not]] in [[#^note-2c|word]], the same is a [[#^note-2d|perfect]] man, and able also to bridle the whole body. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the [[#^note-4a|governor]] listeth. ^verse-4

**5**  Even so the tongue is a little member, and [[#^note-5a|boasteth]] great things. Behold, how great a [[#^note-5b|matter]] a little fire kindleth! ^verse-5

**6**  And the [[#^note-6a|tongue]] is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. ^verse-6

**7**  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: ^verse-7

**8**  But the [[#^note-8a|tongue]] can no man tame; it is an [[#^note-8b|unruly]] evil, full of deadly poison. ^verse-8

**9**  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith [[#^note-9a|curse]] we men, which are made after the [[#^note-9b|similitude]] of God. ^verse-9

**10**  Out of the same [[#^note-10a|mouth]] proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. ^verse-10

**11**  Doth a [[#^note-11a|fountain]] send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? ^verse-11

**12**  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. ^verse-12

**13**  Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good [[#^note-13a|conversation]] his works with [[#^note-13b|meekness]] of wisdom. ^verse-13

**14**  But if ye have bitter envying and [[#^note-14a|strife]] in your hearts, [[#^note-14b|glory not]], and lie not against the truth. ^verse-14

**15**  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. ^verse-15

**16**  For where [[#^note-16a|envying]] and [[#^note-16b|strife]] is, there is confusion and every evil work. ^verse-16

**17**  But the [[#^note-17a|wisdom]] that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and [[#^note-17b|easy to be entreated]], full of [[#^note-17c|mercy]] and good fruits, without partiality, and without [[#^note-17d|hypocrisy]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And the fruit of [[#^note-18a|righteousness]] is sown in [[#^note-18b|peace]] of them that make [[#^note-18c|peace]]. ^verse-18
