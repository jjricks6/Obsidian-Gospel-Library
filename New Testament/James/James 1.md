### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/James|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/James/James 2|Next Entry]]

*If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God—Resist temptation—Be doers of the word—James explains how to recognize pure religion.*

**1**  James, a [[#^note-1a|servant]] of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are [[#^note-1b|scattered]] abroad, greeting. ^verse-1

**2**  My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into [[#^note-2a|divers]] [[#^note-2b|temptations]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Knowing this, that the [[#^note-3a|trying]] of your faith worketh [[#^note-3b|patience]]. ^verse-3

**4**  But let patience have her [[#^note-4a|perfect]] work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|If]] any of you lack [[#^note-5b|wisdom]], let him ask of God, that [[#^note-5c|giveth]] to all men liberally, and [[#^note-5d|upbraideth]] not; and it shall be given him. ^verse-5

**6**  But let him [[#^note-6a|ask]] in [[#^note-6b|faith]], nothing [[#^note-6c|wavering]]. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. ^verse-6

**7**  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  A [[#^note-8a|double minded]] man is unstable in all his ways. ^verse-8

**9**  Let the brother of [[#^note-9a|low]] degree rejoice in that he is exalted: ^verse-9

**10**  But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the [[#^note-10a|grass]] he shall pass away. ^verse-10

**11**  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the [[#^note-11a|grace]] of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the [[#^note-11b|rich]] man fade away in his ways. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Blessed]] is the man that [[#^note-12b|endureth temptation]]: for when he is [[#^note-12c|tried]], he shall receive the [[#^note-12d|crown]] of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. ^verse-12

**13**  Let no man say when he is [[#^note-13a|tempted]], I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with [[#^note-13b|evil]], neither tempteth he any man: ^verse-13

**14**  But every man is [[#^note-14a|tempted]], when he is drawn away of his own [[#^note-14b|lust]], and enticed. ^verse-14

**15**  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth [[#^note-15a|sin]]: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. ^verse-15

**16**  Do not err, my beloved brethren. ^verse-16

**17**  Every [[#^note-17a|good]] [[#^note-17b|gift]] and every perfect [[#^note-17c|gift]] is from above, and [[#^note-17d|cometh]] down from the [[#^note-17e|Father]] of lights, with whom is no [[#^note-17f|variableness]], neither shadow of turning. ^verse-17

**18**  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. ^verse-18

**19**    Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to [[#^note-19a|speak]], [[#^note-19b|slow]] to [[#^note-19c|wrath]]: ^verse-19

**20**  For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. ^verse-20

**21**  Wherefore lay apart all [[#^note-21a|filthiness]] and [[#^note-21b|superfluity of naughtiness]], and receive with [[#^note-21c|meekness]] the [[#^note-21d|engrafted]] word, which is able to save your souls. ^verse-21

**22**  But be ye [[#^note-22a|doers]] of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. ^verse-22

**23**  For if any be a [[#^note-23a|hearer]] of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a [[#^note-23b|glass]]: ^verse-23

**24**  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. ^verse-24

**25**  But whoso looketh into the perfect [[#^note-25a|law]] of [[#^note-25b|liberty]], and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. ^verse-25

**26**  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his [[#^note-26a|tongue]], but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is [[#^note-26b|vain]]. ^verse-26

**27**  Pure [[#^note-27a|religion]] and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To [[#^note-27b|visit]] the [[#^note-27c|fatherless]] and [[#^note-27d|widows]] in their [[#^note-27e|affliction]], and to keep himself [[#^note-27f|unspotted]] from [[#^note-27g|the]] [[#^note-27h|world]]. ^verse-27
