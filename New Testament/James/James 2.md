### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/James/James 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/James/James 3|Next Entry]]

*God has chosen the poor of this world who are rich in faith—Salvation is gained by keeping the whole law—Faith without works is dead.*

**1**  My brethren, [[#^note-1a|have]] not the faith of our [[#^note-1b|Lord Jesus Christ]], the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. ^verse-1

**2**  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a [[#^note-2a|poor]] man in [[#^note-2b|vile]] raiment; ^verse-2

**3**  And ye have respect to him that weareth the [[#^note-3a|gay]] clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Are]] ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? ^verse-4

**5**  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the [[#^note-5a|poor]] of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? ^verse-5

**6**  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men [[#^note-6a|oppress]] you, and draw you before the judgment seats? ^verse-6

**7**  Do not they blaspheme that worthy [[#^note-7a|name]] by the which ye are called? ^verse-7

**8**  If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt [[#^note-8a|love]] thy [[#^note-8b|neighbour]] as thyself, ye do well: ^verse-8

**9**  But if ye have [[#^note-9a|respect]] to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. ^verse-9

**10**  For whosoever shall keep the [[#^note-10a|whole]] law, and yet [[#^note-10b|offend]] in one point, he is [[#^note-10c|guilty]] of all. ^verse-10

**11**  For he that said, Do not commit [[#^note-11a|adultery]], said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. ^verse-11

**12**  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of [[#^note-12a|liberty]]. ^verse-12

**13**  For he shall have [[#^note-13a|judgment]] without [[#^note-13b|mercy]], that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|What]] doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath [[#^note-14b|faith]], and have not works? can faith save him? ^verse-14

**15**  If a [[#^note-15a|brother]] or sister be naked, and destitute of daily [[#^note-15b|food]], ^verse-15

**16**  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye [[#^note-16a|give]] them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? ^verse-16

**17**  Even so [[#^note-17a|faith]], if it hath not [[#^note-17b|works]], is dead, being alone. ^verse-17

**18**  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast [[#^note-18a|faith]], and I have [[#^note-18b|works]]: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. ^verse-18

**19**  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the [[#^note-19a|devils]] also [[#^note-19b|believe]], and tremble. ^verse-19

**20**  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that [[#^note-20a|faith]] without [[#^note-20b|works]] is dead? ^verse-20

**21**  Was not Abraham our father [[#^note-21a|justified]] by works, when he had [[#^note-21b|offered]] Isaac his son upon the altar? ^verse-21

**22**  Seest thou how faith wrought with his [[#^note-22a|works]], and by works was faith made [[#^note-22b|perfect]]? ^verse-22

**23**  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham [[#^note-23a|believed]] God, and it was imputed unto him for [[#^note-23b|righteousness]]: and he was called the [[#^note-23c|Friend]] of God. ^verse-23

**24**  Ye see then how that by [[#^note-24a|works]] a man is [[#^note-24b|justified]], and not by faith only. ^verse-24

**25**  Likewise also was not [[#^note-25a|Rahab]] the harlot [[#^note-25b|justified]] by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? ^verse-25

**26**  For as the body without the [[#^note-26a|spirit]] is [[#^note-26b|dead]], so faith without [[#^note-26c|works]] is dead also. ^verse-26
