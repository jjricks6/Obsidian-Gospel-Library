[[New Testament/James/James 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/James/James 5|Next Entry]]

*Wars are born of lusts—The friends of the world are the enemies of God—Sin is failure to walk in the light we have received.*

**1**  From whence come [[#^note-1a|wars]] and [[#^note-1b|fightings]] among you? come they not hence, even of your [[#^note-1c|lusts]] that war in your members? ^verse-1

**2**  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. ^verse-2

**3**  Ye [[#^note-3a|ask]], and receive not, because ye [[#^note-3b|ask]] [[#^note-3c|amiss]], that ye may [[#^note-3d|consume]] it upon your [[#^note-3e|lusts]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Ye [[#^note-4a|adulterers]] and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the [[#^note-4b|world]] is [[#^note-4c|enmity]] with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the [[#^note-4d|enemy]] of God. ^verse-4

**5**  Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to [[#^note-5a|envy]]? ^verse-5

**6**  But he giveth more [[#^note-6a|grace]]. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the [[#^note-6b|proud]], but giveth grace unto the [[#^note-6c|humble]]. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Submit]] yourselves therefore to God. [[#^note-7b|Resist]] the [[#^note-7c|devil]], and he will flee from you. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Draw]] [[#^note-8b|nigh]] to God, and he will draw nigh to you. [[#^note-8c|Cleanse]] your hands, ye sinners; and [[#^note-8d|purify]] your hearts, ye double minded. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Be afflicted]], and mourn, and [[#^note-9b|weep]]: let your laughter be turned to [[#^note-9c|mourning]], and your joy to heaviness. ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Humble]] yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Speak]] not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the [[#^note-11b|law]], and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. ^verse-11

**12**  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that [[#^note-12a|judgest]] another? ^verse-12

**13**  Go to now, ye that say, To day or to [[#^note-13a|morrow]] we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: ^verse-13

**14**  Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a [[#^note-14a|vapour]], that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. ^verse-14

**15**  For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. ^verse-15

**16**  But now ye rejoice in your [[#^note-16a|boastings]]: all such rejoicing is evil. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore to him that [[#^note-17a|knoweth]] to do good, and [[#^note-17b|doeth]] it not, to him it is [[#^note-17c|sin]]. ^verse-17
