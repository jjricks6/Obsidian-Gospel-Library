### Chapter 1

[[New Testament/Hebrews|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 2|Next Entry]]

*The Son is in the express image of the person of the Fatherâ€”Christ is the Only Begotten Son and thus above the angels.*

**1**  God, who [[#^note-1a|at]] sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the [[#^note-1b|fathers]] by the [[#^note-1c|prophets]], ^verse-1

**2**  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his [[#^note-2a|Son]], whom he hath [[#^note-2b|appointed]] [[#^note-2c|heir]] of all things, by whom also he [[#^note-2d|made]] the [[#^note-2e|worlds]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Who being the brightness of his [[#^note-3a|glory]], and the express image of his [[#^note-3b|person]], and upholding all things by the word of his [[#^note-3c|power]], when he had by himself [[#^note-3d|purged]] our sins, sat down on the [[#^note-3e|right hand]] of the [[#^note-3f|Majesty]] on high; ^verse-3

**4**  Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent [[#^note-4a|name]] than they. ^verse-4

**5**  For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my [[#^note-5a|Son]], this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a [[#^note-5b|Father]], and he shall be to me a Son? ^verse-5

**6**  And again, when he bringeth in the [[#^note-6a|firstbegotten]] into the world, he saith, [[#^note-6b|And]] let all the angels of God [[#^note-6c|worship]] him. ^verse-6

**7**  And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. ^verse-7

**8**  But unto the Son he saith, Thy [[#^note-8a|throne]], O God, is for [[#^note-8b|ever]] and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. ^verse-8

**9**  Thou hast loved [[#^note-9a|righteousness]], and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. ^verse-9

**10**  And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the [[#^note-10a|foundation]] of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine [[#^note-10b|hands]]: ^verse-10

**11**  They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall [[#^note-11a|wax old]] as doth a garment; ^verse-11

**12**  And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. ^verse-12

**13**  But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my [[#^note-13a|right hand]], until I make thine enemies thy footstool? ^verse-13

**14**  Are they not all [[#^note-14a|ministering]] [[#^note-14b|spirits]], sent forth [[#^note-14c|to minister]] for them who shall be heirs of salvation? ^verse-14
