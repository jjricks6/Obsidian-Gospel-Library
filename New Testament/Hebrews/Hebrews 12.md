### Chapter 12

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 13|Next Entry]]

*Whom the Lord loves He chastens—God is the Father of spirits—To see God, follow peace and holiness—Exalted Saints belong to the Church of the Firstborn.*

**1**  Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the [[#^note-1a|sin]] which doth so easily [[#^note-1b|beset]] us, and let us run with [[#^note-1c|patience]] the race that is set before us, ^verse-1

**2**  Looking unto Jesus the [[#^note-2a|author]] and [[#^note-2b|finisher of]] our faith; who for the joy that was set before him [[#^note-2c|endured]] the cross, despising the [[#^note-2d|shame]], and is set down at the right hand of the [[#^note-2e|throne]] of God. ^verse-2

**3**  For consider him that endured such [[#^note-3a|contradiction]] of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. ^verse-3

**4**  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, [[#^note-4a|striving]] against sin. ^verse-4

**5**  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: ^verse-5

**6**  For whom the Lord loveth he [[#^note-6a|chasteneth]], and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. ^verse-6

**7**  If ye [[#^note-7a|endure]] [[#^note-7b|chastening]], God dealeth with you as with [[#^note-7c|sons]]; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? ^verse-7

**8**  But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. ^verse-8

**9**  Furthermore we have had [[#^note-9a|fathers]] of our flesh which [[#^note-9b|corrected]] us, and we gave them [[#^note-9c|reverence]]: shall we not much rather be in [[#^note-9d|subjection]] unto the [[#^note-9e|Father]] of [[#^note-9f|spirits]], and live? ^verse-9

**10**  For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his [[#^note-10a|holiness]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the [[#^note-11a|peaceable]] fruit of righteousness unto them which are [[#^note-11b|exercised]] thereby. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the [[#^note-12a|feeble]] knees; ^verse-12

**13**  And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be [[#^note-13a|healed]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Follow [[#^note-14a|peace]] with all men, and [[#^note-14b|holiness]], without which no man shall [[#^note-14c|see]] the Lord: ^verse-14

**15**  Looking diligently lest any man [[#^note-15a|fail of]] the [[#^note-15b|grace]] of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; ^verse-15

**16**  Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his [[#^note-16a|birthright]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with [[#^note-17a|tears]]. ^verse-17

**18**  For ye are not come unto the [[#^note-18a|mount]] that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, ^verse-18

**19**  And the sound of a trumpet, and the [[#^note-19a|voice]] of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: ^verse-19

**20**  (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: ^verse-20

**21**  And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) ^verse-21

**22**  But ye are come unto mount [[#^note-22a|Sion]], and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of [[#^note-22b|angels]], ^verse-22

**23**  To the general assembly and church of the [[#^note-23a|firstborn]], which are [[#^note-23b|written]] in heaven, and to God the [[#^note-23c|Judge]] of all, and to the [[#^note-23d|spirits]] of [[#^note-23e|just]] men made perfect, ^verse-23

**24**  And to Jesus the [[#^note-24a|mediator]] of the [[#^note-24b|new]] [[#^note-24c|covenant]], and to the [[#^note-24d|blood]] of sprinkling, that speaketh [[#^note-24e|better]] things than that of Abel. ^verse-24

**25**  See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they [[#^note-25a|escaped]] not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: ^verse-25

**26**  Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I [[#^note-26a|shake]] not the earth only, but also heaven. ^verse-26

**27**  And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. ^verse-27

**28**  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with [[#^note-28a|reverence]] and godly [[#^note-28b|fear]]: ^verse-28

**29**  For our God is a consuming fire. ^verse-29
