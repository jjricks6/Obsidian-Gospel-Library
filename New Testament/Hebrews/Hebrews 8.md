### Chapter 8

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 9|Next Entry]]

*Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice for sinâ€”God promised to make a new covenant with Israel.*

**1**  Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an [[#^note-1a|high priest]], who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; ^verse-1

**2**  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the [[#^note-2a|true]] [[#^note-2b|tabernacle]], which the Lord pitched, and not man. ^verse-2

**3**  For every high priest is ordained to [[#^note-3a|offer]] gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|For]] if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are [[#^note-4b|priests]] that offer gifts according to the law: ^verse-4

**5**  Who serve unto the example and [[#^note-5a|shadow]] of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the [[#^note-5b|tabernacle]]: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the [[#^note-5c|pattern]] shewed to thee in the mount. ^verse-5

**6**  But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the [[#^note-6a|mediator]] of a better [[#^note-6b|covenant]], which was established upon better [[#^note-6c|promises]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For if that first covenant had been [[#^note-7a|faultless]], then should no place have been sought for the second. ^verse-7

**8**  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of [[#^note-8a|Judah]]: ^verse-8

**9**  Not according to the [[#^note-9a|covenant]] that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. ^verse-9

**10**  For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my [[#^note-10a|laws]] into their [[#^note-10b|mind]], and write them in their [[#^note-10c|hearts]]: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: ^verse-10

**11**  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. ^verse-11

**12**  For I will be merciful to their [[#^note-12a|unrighteousness]], and their sins and their iniquities will I [[#^note-12b|remember]] no more. ^verse-12

**13**  In that he saith, A [[#^note-13a|new covenant]], he hath made the first [[#^note-13b|old]]. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to [[#^note-13c|vanish]] away. ^verse-13
