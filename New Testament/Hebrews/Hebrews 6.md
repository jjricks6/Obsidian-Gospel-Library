[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 7|Next Entry]]

*Let us go on to perfection—The sons of perdition crucify Christ anew—God swears with an oath that the faithful will be saved.*

**1**  Therefore [[#^note-1a|leaving]] the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto [[#^note-1b|perfection]]; not laying again the foundation of [[#^note-1c|repentance]] from dead works, and of faith toward God, ^verse-1

**2**  Of the [[#^note-2a|doctrine]] of [[#^note-2b|baptisms]], and of [[#^note-2c|laying]] on of [[#^note-2d|hands]], and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|And]] this will we do, if God permit. ^verse-3

**4**  For it is impossible for those who were once [[#^note-4a|enlightened]], and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, ^verse-4

**5**  And have [[#^note-5a|tasted]] the good word of God, and the powers of the [[#^note-5b|world]] to come, ^verse-5

**6**  If they shall [[#^note-6a|fall away]], to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they [[#^note-6b|crucify]] to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open [[#^note-6c|shame]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs [[#^note-7a|meet]] for them by whom it is [[#^note-7b|dressed]], receiveth blessing from God: ^verse-7

**8**  But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto [[#^note-8a|cursing]]; whose end is to be burned. ^verse-8

**9**  But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. ^verse-9

**10**  For God is not [[#^note-10a|unrighteous]] to forget your work and [[#^note-10b|labour]] of [[#^note-10c|love]], which ye have shewed toward his [[#^note-10d|name]], in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. ^verse-10

**11**  And we desire that every one of you do shew the same [[#^note-11a|diligence]] to the full assurance of hope unto the end: ^verse-11

**12**  That ye be not [[#^note-12a|slothful]], but followers of them who through [[#^note-12b|faith]] and [[#^note-12c|patience]] inherit the [[#^note-12d|promises]]. ^verse-12

**13**  For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could [[#^note-13a|swear by]] no greater, he [[#^note-13b|sware]] by himself, ^verse-13

**14**  Saying, Surely [[#^note-14a|bless]]ing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. ^verse-14

**15**  And so, after he had patiently [[#^note-15a|endured]], he obtained the promise. ^verse-15

**16**  For men verily swear by the greater: and an [[#^note-16a|oath]] for confirmation is to them an end of all [[#^note-16b|strife]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his [[#^note-17a|counsel]], [[#^note-17b|confirmed]] it by an [[#^note-17c|oath]]: ^verse-17

**18**  That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to [[#^note-18a|lie]], we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for [[#^note-18b|refuge]] to lay hold upon the [[#^note-18c|hope]] set before us: ^verse-18

**19**  Which hope we have as an [[#^note-19a|anchor]] of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the [[#^note-19b|veil]]; ^verse-19

**20**  Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an [[#^note-20a|high priest]] for ever after the order of Melchisedec. ^verse-20
