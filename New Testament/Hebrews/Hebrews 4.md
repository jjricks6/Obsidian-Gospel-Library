[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 5|Next Entry]]

*The gospel was offered to ancient Israel—Saints enter into the rest of the Lord—Though tempted in all points, Jesus was without sin.*

**1**  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his [[#^note-1a|rest]], any of you should seem to come short of it. ^verse-1

**2**  For unto us was the [[#^note-2a|gospel]] preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with [[#^note-2b|faith]] in them that heard it. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|For]] we which have believed do enter into [[#^note-3b|rest]], as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. ^verse-3

**4**  For he spake in a certain place of the [[#^note-4a|seventh day]] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|And]] in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. ^verse-5

**6**  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and [[#^note-6a|they]] to whom it was first preached entered not in because of [[#^note-6b|unbelief]]: ^verse-6

**7**  Again, he [[#^note-7a|limiteth]] a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will [[#^note-7b|hear]] his voice, [[#^note-7c|harden]] not your hearts. ^verse-7

**8**  For if [[#^note-8a|Jesus]] had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. ^verse-8

**9**  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. ^verse-9

**10**  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. ^verse-10

**11**  Let us [[#^note-11a|labour]] therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of [[#^note-11b|unbelief]]. ^verse-11

**12**  For the [[#^note-12a|word]] of God is [[#^note-12b|quick]], and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged [[#^note-12c|sword]], [[#^note-12d|piercing]] even to the dividing asunder of [[#^note-12e|soul]] and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a [[#^note-12f|discerner]] of the [[#^note-12g|thoughts]] and [[#^note-12h|intents]] of the heart. ^verse-12

**13**  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the [[#^note-13a|eyes]] of him with whom we have to do. ^verse-13

**14**  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the [[#^note-14a|heavens]], Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. ^verse-14

**15**  For we have not an high priest [[#^note-15a|which]] cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points [[#^note-15b|tempted]] like as we are, yet without [[#^note-15c|sin]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of [[#^note-16a|grace]], that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. ^verse-16
