*Christ is the Apostle and High Priest of our profession—Jesus, being the Son, is more than a servant—Now is the time and the day of our salvation.*

**1**  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, [[#^note-1a|consider]] the [[#^note-1b|Apostle]] and [[#^note-1c|High Priest]] of our profession, Christ Jesus; ^verse-1

**2**  Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. ^verse-2

**3**  For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. ^verse-3

**4**  For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. ^verse-4

**5**  And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a [[#^note-5a|servant]], for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; ^verse-5

**6**  But Christ as a son over his own [[#^note-6a|house]]; whose [[#^note-6b|house]] are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore (as the [[#^note-7a|Holy Ghost]] saith, [[#^note-7b|To day]] if ye will hear his voice, ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Harden]] not your hearts, as in the [[#^note-8b|provocation]], in the day of temptation in the wilderness: ^verse-8

**9**  When your fathers tempted me, [[#^note-9a|proved]] me, and saw my works forty years. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore I was grieved with that [[#^note-10a|generation]], and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. ^verse-10

**11**  So I sware in my wrath, They shall not [[#^note-11a|enter]] into my [[#^note-11b|rest]].) ^verse-11

**12**  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil [[#^note-12a|heart]] of [[#^note-12b|unbelief]], in [[#^note-12c|departing from]] the living God. ^verse-12

**13**  But [[#^note-13a|exhort]] one another daily, while it is called [[#^note-13b|To day]]; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. ^verse-13

**14**  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence [[#^note-14a|steadfast]] unto the end; ^verse-14

**15**  While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, [[#^note-15a|harden]] not your hearts, as in the [[#^note-15b|provocation]]. ^verse-15

**16**  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. ^verse-16

**17**  But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose [[#^note-17a|carcases]] fell in the wilderness? ^verse-17

**18**  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? ^verse-18

**19**  So we see that they could not enter in because of [[#^note-19a|unbelief]]. ^verse-19
