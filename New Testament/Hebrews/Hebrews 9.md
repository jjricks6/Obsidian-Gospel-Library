### Chapter 9

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 8|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 10|Next Entry]]

*The Mosaic ordinances prefigured Christ's ministryâ€”Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant.*

**1**  Then verily the first [[#^note-1a|covenant]] had also [[#^note-1b|ordinances]] of divine [[#^note-1c|service]], and a worldly sanctuary. ^verse-1

**2**  For there was a [[#^note-2a|tabernacle]] made; the first, wherein was the [[#^note-2b|candlestick]], and the [[#^note-2c|table]], and the [[#^note-2d|shewbread]]; which is called the sanctuary. ^verse-2

**3**  And after the second [[#^note-3a|veil]], the tabernacle which is called the [[#^note-3b|Holiest]] of all; ^verse-3

**4**  Which had the golden censer, and the [[#^note-4a|ark]] of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden [[#^note-4b|pot]] that had manna, and [[#^note-4c|Aaron's]] rod that budded, and the [[#^note-4d|tables]] of the covenant; ^verse-4

**5**  And over it the [[#^note-5a|cherubims]] of glory shadowing the [[#^note-5b|mercyseat]]; of which we cannot now speak particularly. ^verse-5

**6**  Now when these things were thus [[#^note-6a|ordained]], the [[#^note-6b|priests]] went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. ^verse-6

**7**  But into the second went the [[#^note-7a|high priest]] alone [[#^note-7b|once]] every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: ^verse-7

**8**  The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: ^verse-8

**9**  Which was a [[#^note-9a|figure]] for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service [[#^note-9b|perfect]], as pertaining to the conscience; ^verse-9

**10**  Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers [[#^note-10a|washings]], and [[#^note-10b|carnal]] [[#^note-10c|ordinances]], [[#^note-10d|imposed]] on them until the time of reformation. ^verse-10

**11**  But Christ being come an [[#^note-11a|high priest]] of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect [[#^note-11b|tabernacle]], not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; ^verse-11

**12**  Neither by the [[#^note-12a|blood]] of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the [[#^note-12b|holy place]], having obtained eternal [[#^note-12c|redemption]] for us. ^verse-12

**13**  For if the [[#^note-13a|blood]] of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the [[#^note-13b|purifying]] of the flesh: ^verse-13

**14**  How much more shall the [[#^note-14a|blood]] of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself [[#^note-14b|without]] [[#^note-14c|spot]] to God, [[#^note-14d|purge]] your [[#^note-14e|conscience]] from dead works to serve the living God? ^verse-14

**15**  And for this cause he is the [[#^note-15a|mediator]] of the [[#^note-15b|new]] [[#^note-15c|testament]], that by means of [[#^note-15d|death]], for the redemption of the [[#^note-15e|transgressions]] that were under the first [[#^note-15f|testament]], they which are called might receive the [[#^note-15g|promise]] of eternal [[#^note-15h|inheritance]]. ^verse-15

**16**  For where a [[#^note-16a|testament]] is, there must also of necessity be the [[#^note-16b|death]] of the [[#^note-16c|testator]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For a [[#^note-17a|testament]] is of force after men are dead: [[#^note-17b|otherwise]] it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. ^verse-17

**18**  Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. ^verse-18

**19**  For when Moses had [[#^note-19a|spoken]] every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the [[#^note-19b|blood]] of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and [[#^note-19c|sprinkled]] both the book, and all the people, ^verse-19

**20**  Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. ^verse-20

**21**  Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. ^verse-21

**22**  And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without [[#^note-22a|shedding]] of blood is no [[#^note-22b|remission]]. ^verse-22

**23**  It was therefore necessary that the [[#^note-23a|patterns]] of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. ^verse-23

**24**  For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the [[#^note-24a|true]]; but into [[#^note-24b|heaven]] itself, now to appear in the [[#^note-24c|presence]] of God for us: ^verse-24

**25**  Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the [[#^note-25a|high priest]] entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; ^verse-25

**26**  For then must he often have suffered s[[#^note-26a|in]]ce the foundation of the world: but now once in the [[#^note-26b|end of the world]] hath he appeared to put away sin by the [[#^note-26c|sacrifice]] of himself. ^verse-26

**27**  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: ^verse-27

**28**  So Christ was once [[#^note-28a|offered]] to [[#^note-28b|bear]] the [[#^note-28c|sins]] of many; and unto them that look for him shall he [[#^note-28d|appear]] the second time without sin unto salvation. ^verse-28
