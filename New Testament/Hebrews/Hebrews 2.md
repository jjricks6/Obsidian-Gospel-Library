### Chapter 2

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 3|Next Entry]]

*Jesus came to suffer death and save menâ€”He came to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.*

**1**  Therefore we ought to give the more [[#^note-1a|earnest]] [[#^note-1b|heed]] to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. ^verse-1

**2**  For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and [[#^note-2a|disobedience]] received a [[#^note-2b|just]] recompence of reward; ^verse-2

**3**  How shall we [[#^note-3a|escape]], if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; ^verse-3

**4**  God also bearing them witness, both with [[#^note-4a|signs]] and [[#^note-4b|wonders]], and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own [[#^note-4c|will]]? ^verse-4

**5**  For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. ^verse-5

**6**  But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is [[#^note-6a|man]], that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? ^verse-6

**7**  Thou madest him a little lower than the [[#^note-7a|angels]]; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: ^verse-7

**8**  Thou hast put all things in subjection under his [[#^note-8a|feet]]. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. ^verse-8

**9**  But we see Jesus, who was made a little [[#^note-9a|lower]] than the [[#^note-9b|angels]] [[#^note-9c|for]] the suffering of [[#^note-9d|death]], [[#^note-9e|crowned]] with glory and honour; that he by the [[#^note-9f|grace]] of God should taste [[#^note-9g|death]] for every man. ^verse-9

**10**  For [[#^note-10a|it became him]], for whom are all [[#^note-10b|things]], and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the [[#^note-10c|captain]] of their salvation [[#^note-10d|perfect]] through sufferings. ^verse-10

**11**  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are [[#^note-11a|sanctified]] are all of [[#^note-11b|one]]: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them [[#^note-11c|brethren]], ^verse-11

**12**  Saying, I will declare thy [[#^note-12a|name]] unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. ^verse-12

**13**  And again, I will put my [[#^note-13a|trust]] in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Forasmuch then as]] the children are partakers of [[#^note-14b|flesh and blood]], he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might [[#^note-14c|destroy]] him that had the power of [[#^note-14d|death]], that is, the [[#^note-14e|devil]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to [[#^note-15a|bondage]]. ^verse-15

**16**  For verily he took not on him the nature of [[#^note-16a|angels]]; but he took on him the [[#^note-16b|seed of Abraham]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make [[#^note-17a|reconciliation]] for the sins of the people. ^verse-17

**18**  For in that he himself hath suffered being [[#^note-18a|tempted]], he is able to [[#^note-18b|succour]] them that are tempted. ^verse-18
