### Chapter 5

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 4|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 6|Next Entry]]

*For a man to hold the priesthood, he must be called of God as was Aaron—Christ was a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek—Jesus Christ is the Author of eternal salvation.*

**1**  For every high priest taken from among men is [[#^note-1a|ordained]] for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and [[#^note-1b|sacrifices]] for sins: ^verse-1

**2**  Who can have [[#^note-2a|compassion]] on the ignorant, and on them that are [[#^note-2b|out of the way]]; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. ^verse-2

**3**  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for [[#^note-3a|sins]]. ^verse-3

**4**    And no man taketh this [[#^note-4a|honour]] unto himself, but he that is [[#^note-4b|called]] of God, as was [[#^note-4c|Aaron]]. ^verse-4

**5**  So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my [[#^note-5a|Son]], to day have I begotten thee. ^verse-5

**6**  As he saith also in another place, Thou art a [[#^note-6a|priest]] [[#^note-6b|for ever]] after the order of [[#^note-6c|Melchisedec]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up [[#^note-7a|prayers]] and supplications with [[#^note-7b|strong crying]] and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard [[#^note-7c|in that he feared]]; ^verse-7

**8**  Though he were a Son, yet [[#^note-8a|learned]] he [[#^note-8b|obedience]] by the things which he [[#^note-8c|suffered]]; ^verse-8

**9**  And being made [[#^note-9a|perfect]], he became the [[#^note-9b|author]] of eternal [[#^note-9c|salvation]] unto all them that obey him; ^verse-9

**10**  [[#^note-10a|Called]] of God an [[#^note-10b|high priest]] after the order of Melchisedec. ^verse-10

**11**  Of whom we have many things to say, and [[#^note-11a|hard]] to be [[#^note-11b|uttered]], seeing ye are dull of [[#^note-11c|hearing]]. ^verse-11

**12**  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of [[#^note-12a|milk]], and not of strong meat. ^verse-12

**13**  For every one that useth [[#^note-13a|milk]] is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. ^verse-13

**14**  But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. ^verse-14
