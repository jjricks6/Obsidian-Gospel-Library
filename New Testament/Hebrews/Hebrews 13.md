### Chapter 13

[[New Testament/Hebrews/Hebrews 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/James|Next Entry]]

*Marriage is honorable—Christ is the same everlastingly—Paul explains how the Saints are to offer acceptable sacrifices.*

**1**  Let [[#^note-1a|brotherly]] [[#^note-1b|love]] continue. ^verse-1

**2**  Be not forgetful to [[#^note-2a|entertain]] [[#^note-2b|strangers]]: for thereby some have entertained [[#^note-2c|angels]] [[#^note-2d|unawares]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Remember them that are in [[#^note-3a|bonds]], as bound with them; and them which [[#^note-3b|suffer]] adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Marriage]] is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but [[#^note-4b|whoremongers]] and [[#^note-4c|adulterers]] God will [[#^note-4d|judge]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Let your conversation be without [[#^note-5a|covetousness]]; and be [[#^note-5b|content]] with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor [[#^note-5c|forsake]] thee. ^verse-5

**6**  So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. ^verse-6

**7**  Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. ^verse-7

**8**  Jesus Christ the [[#^note-8a|same]] yesterday, and to day, and for ever. ^verse-8

**9**  Be not [[#^note-9a|carried]] about with divers and strange [[#^note-9b|doctrines]]. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. ^verse-9

**10**  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. ^verse-10

**11**  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might [[#^note-12a|sanctify]] the people with his own [[#^note-12b|blood]], [[#^note-12c|suffered]] [[#^note-12d|without]] the gate. ^verse-12

**13**  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his [[#^note-13a|reproach]]. ^verse-13

**14**  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. ^verse-14

**15**  By him therefore let us offer the [[#^note-15a|sacrifice]] of praise to God continually, that is, the [[#^note-15b|fruit]] of our lips giving thanks to his name. ^verse-15

**16**  But to do good and to [[#^note-16a|communicate]] forget not: for with such [[#^note-16b|sacrifices]] God is well pleased. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Obey]] them that have the rule over you, and [[#^note-17b|submit]] yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. ^verse-17

**18**  Pray for us: for we trust we have a good [[#^note-18a|conscience]], in all things willing to live [[#^note-18b|honestly]]. ^verse-18

**19**  But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. ^verse-19

**20**  Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great [[#^note-20a|shepherd]] of the sheep, through the blood of the [[#^note-20b|everlasting]] [[#^note-20c|covenant]], ^verse-20

**21**  Make you perfect in every good [[#^note-21a|work]] to do his [[#^note-21b|will]], working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^verse-21

**22**  And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. ^verse-22

**23**  Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. ^verse-23

**24**  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. ^verse-24

**25**  Grace be with you all. Amen. ^verse-25
