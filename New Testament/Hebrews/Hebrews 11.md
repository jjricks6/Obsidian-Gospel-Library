*By faith we understand the word and work of God—The faith of the ancients was centered in Christ—By faith, men subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, and worked miracles.*

**1**  Now [[#^note-1a|faith]] is the [[#^note-1b|substance]] of things [[#^note-1c|hoped]] for, the [[#^note-1d|evidence]] of things not seen. ^verse-1

**2**  For by it the elders [[#^note-2a|obtained]] a good [[#^note-2b|report]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Through faith we understand that the worlds were [[#^note-3a|framed]] by the [[#^note-3b|word]] of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. ^verse-3

**4**  By faith [[#^note-4a|Abel]] offered unto God a more excellent [[#^note-4b|sacrifice]] than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. ^verse-4

**5**    By faith [[#^note-5a|Enoch]] was [[#^note-5b|translated]] that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this [[#^note-5c|testimony]], that he pleased God. ^verse-5

**6**  But without [[#^note-6a|faith]] it is impossible to please him: for he that [[#^note-6b|cometh]] to God must believe that he is, and that he is a [[#^note-6c|rewarder]] of them that [[#^note-6d|diligently]] [[#^note-6e|seek]] him. ^verse-6

**7**  By faith [[#^note-7a|Noah]], being [[#^note-7b|warned]] of God of things not seen as yet, [[#^note-7c|moved with fear]], prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the [[#^note-7d|righteousness]] which is by faith. ^verse-7

**8**  By faith [[#^note-8a|Abraham]], when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an [[#^note-8b|inheritance]], [[#^note-8c|obeyed]]; and he went out, not [[#^note-8d|knowing]] whither he went. ^verse-8

**9**  By faith he [[#^note-9a|sojourned]] in the [[#^note-9b|land]] of [[#^note-9c|promise]], as in a strange country, dwelling in [[#^note-9d|tabernacles]] with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: ^verse-9

**10**  For he looked for a [[#^note-10a|city]] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. ^verse-10

**11**  Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in [[#^note-12a|multitude]], and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. ^verse-12

**13**  These all died in faith, not having received the [[#^note-13a|promises]], but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were [[#^note-13b|strangers]] and pilgrims on the earth. ^verse-13

**14**  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a [[#^note-14a|country]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. ^verse-15

**16**  But now they desire a better [[#^note-16a|country]], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. ^verse-16

**17**  By [[#^note-17a|faith]] Abraham, when he was [[#^note-17b|tried]], [[#^note-17c|offered up]] Isaac: and he that had received the [[#^note-17d|promises]] offered up his only begotten son, ^verse-17

**18**  Of whom it was said, That in [[#^note-18a|Isaac]] shall thy [[#^note-18b|seed]] be called: ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Accounting]] that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. ^verse-19

**20**  By faith Isaac [[#^note-20a|blessed]] Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. ^verse-20

**21**  By faith [[#^note-21a|Jacob]], when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. ^verse-21

**22**  By faith [[#^note-22a|Joseph]], when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. ^verse-22

**23**  By faith [[#^note-23a|Moses]], when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a [[#^note-23b|proper]] child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. ^verse-23

**24**  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the [[#^note-24a|son]] of Pharaoh's daughter; ^verse-24

**25**  Choosing rather to [[#^note-25a|suffer]] affliction with the [[#^note-25b|people]] of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; ^verse-25

**26**  Esteeming the [[#^note-26a|reproach]] of Christ greater [[#^note-26b|riches]] than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. ^verse-26

**27**  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. ^verse-27

**28**  Through faith he kept the [[#^note-28a|passover]], and the sprinkling of [[#^note-28b|blood]], lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. ^verse-28

**29**  By faith they passed through the [[#^note-29a|Red sea]] as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. ^verse-29

**30**  By faith the [[#^note-30a|walls]] of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. ^verse-30

**31**  By [[#^note-31a|faith]] the harlot [[#^note-31b|Rahab]] perished not with [[#^note-31c|them that believed not]], when she had received the spies with peace. ^verse-31

**32**  And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of [[#^note-32a|Barak]], and of Samson, and of [[#^note-32b|Jephthae]]; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: ^verse-32

**33**  Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained [[#^note-33a|promises]], stopped the mouths of [[#^note-33b|lions]], ^verse-33

**34**  Quenched the violence of [[#^note-34a|fire]], escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made [[#^note-34b|strong]], waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. ^verse-34

**35**  Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting [[#^note-35a|deliverance]]; that they might obtain [[#^note-35b|a better resurrection]]: ^verse-35

**36**  And others had trial of [[#^note-36a|cruel]] [[#^note-36b|mockings]] and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: ^verse-36

**37**  They were [[#^note-37a|stoned]], they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; ^verse-37

**38**  (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. ^verse-38

**39**  And these all, having obtained a [[#^note-39a|good]] [[#^note-39b|report]] through faith, received not the promise: ^verse-39

**40**  [[#^note-40a|God]] having [[#^note-40b|provided]] some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made [[#^note-40c|perfect]]. ^verse-40
