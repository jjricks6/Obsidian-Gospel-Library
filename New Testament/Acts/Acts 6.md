*The Apostles choose seven to assist them—Stephen is tried before the council.*

**1**  And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their [[#^note-1a|widows]] were [[#^note-1b|neglected]] in the daily [[#^note-1c|ministration]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of [[#^note-3a|honest]] [[#^note-3b|report]], full of the Holy Ghost and [[#^note-3c|wisdom]], whom we may appoint over this [[#^note-3d|business]]. ^verse-3

**4**  But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the [[#^note-4a|ministry]] of the word. ^verse-4

**5**  ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they [[#^note-5a|chose]] Stephen, a man full of faith and of the [[#^note-5b|Holy Ghost]], and [[#^note-5c|Philip]], and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: ^verse-5

**6**  Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they [[#^note-6a|laid]] their [[#^note-6b|hands]] on them. ^verse-6

**7**  And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the [[#^note-7a|priests]] were obedient to the faith. ^verse-7

**8**  And Stephen, full of faith and [[#^note-8a|power]], did great wonders and [[#^note-8b|miracles]] among the people. ^verse-8

**9**  ¶ Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the [[#^note-9a|Libertines]], and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, [[#^note-9b|disputing]] with Stephen. ^verse-9

**10**  And they were not able to resist the [[#^note-10a|wisdom]] and the spirit by which he spake. ^verse-10

**11**  Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak [[#^note-11a|blasphemous]] words against Moses, and against God. ^verse-11

**12**  And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, ^verse-12

**13**  And set up [[#^note-13a|false witnesses]], which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: ^verse-13

**14**  For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the [[#^note-14a|customs]] which Moses delivered us. ^verse-14

**15**  And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his [[#^note-15a|face]] as it had been the face of an [[#^note-15b|angel]]. ^verse-15
