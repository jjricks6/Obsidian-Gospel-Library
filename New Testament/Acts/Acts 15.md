*Great dissension arises at Antioch concerning circumcision—The Apostles at Jerusalem decide the issue—Paul chooses Silas as his companion.*

**1**  And certain men which came down from Judæa taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be [[#^note-1a|circumcised]] after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. ^verse-1

**2**  When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and [[#^note-2a|disputation]] with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the [[#^note-2b|apostles]] and elders about this question. ^verse-2

**3**  And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the [[#^note-3a|conversion]] of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. ^verse-3

**4**  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. ^verse-4

**5**  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the [[#^note-5a|law]] of Moses. ^verse-5

**6**  ¶ And the [[#^note-6a|apostles]] and [[#^note-6b|elders]] came together for to consider of this matter. ^verse-6

**7**  And when there had been much [[#^note-7a|disputing]], [[#^note-7b|Peter]] rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the [[#^note-7c|Gentiles]] by my mouth should hear the word of the [[#^note-7d|gospel]], and believe. ^verse-7

**8**  And God, which [[#^note-8a|knoweth]] the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; ^verse-8

**9**  And put no [[#^note-9a|difference]] between us and them, [[#^note-9b|purifying]] their hearts by faith. ^verse-9

**10**  Now therefore why [[#^note-10a|tempt]] ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? ^verse-10

**11**  But we believe that through the [[#^note-11a|grace]] of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: ^verse-13

**14**  Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the [[#^note-14a|Gentiles]], to take out of them a people for his [[#^note-14b|name]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, ^verse-15

**16**  After this I will return, and will build again the [[#^note-16a|tabernacle]] of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: ^verse-16

**17**  That the [[#^note-17a|residue]] of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Known]] unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: ^verse-19

**20**  But that we write unto them, that they [[#^note-20a|abstain]] from [[#^note-20b|pollutions]] of idols, and from [[#^note-20c|fornication]], and from things strangled, and from [[#^note-20d|blood]]. ^verse-20

**21**  For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being [[#^note-21a|read]] in the synagogues every sabbath day. ^verse-21

**22**  Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: ^verse-22

**23**  And they [[#^note-23a|wrote]] [[#^note-23b|letters]] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: ^verse-23

**24**  Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be [[#^note-24a|circumcised]], and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: ^verse-24

**25**  It seemed good unto us, being assembled with [[#^note-25a|one]] accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, ^verse-25

**26**  Men that have [[#^note-26a|hazarded]] their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^verse-26

**27**  We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. ^verse-27

**28**  For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; ^verse-28

**29**  That ye abstain from meats offered to [[#^note-29a|idols]], and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. ^verse-29

**30**  So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: ^verse-30

**31**  Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the [[#^note-31a|consolation]]. ^verse-31

**32**  And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. ^verse-32

**33**  And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. ^verse-33

**34**  Notwithstanding it pleased [[#^note-34a|Silas]] to abide there still. ^verse-34

**35**  Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and [[#^note-36a|visit]] our [[#^note-36b|brethren]] in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do. ^verse-36

**37**  And Barnabas determined to take with them [[#^note-37a|John]], whose surname was [[#^note-37b|Mark]]. ^verse-37

**38**  But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. ^verse-38

**39**  And the [[#^note-39a|contention]] was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; ^verse-39

**40**  And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. ^verse-40

**41**  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, [[#^note-41a|confirming]] the churches. ^verse-41
