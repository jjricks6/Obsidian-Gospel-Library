### Chapter 8

[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 9|Next Entry]]

*Saul persecutes the Church—Philip's ministry in Samaria is described—Philip performs miracles and baptizes men and women—Peter and John come to Samaria and confer the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands—Simon seeks to buy this gift and is rebuked by Peter—Philip preaches about Christ and baptizes an Ethiopian eunuch.*

**1**  And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great [[#^note-1a|persecution]] against the [[#^note-1b|church]] which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles. ^verse-1

**2**  And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great [[#^note-2a|lamentation]] over him. ^verse-2

**3**  As for Saul, he made [[#^note-3a|havoc]] of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to [[#^note-3b|prison]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. ^verse-4

**5**  Then Philip went down to the city of [[#^note-5a|Samaria]], and preached Christ unto them. ^verse-5

**6**  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip [[#^note-6a|spake]], hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. ^verse-6

**7**  For [[#^note-7a|unclean spirits]], crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many [[#^note-7b|taken]] with palsies, and that were lame, were [[#^note-7c|healed]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And there was great joy in that city. ^verse-8

**9**  But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used [[#^note-9a|sorcery]], and [[#^note-9b|bewitched]] the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some [[#^note-9c|great]] one: ^verse-9

**10**  To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. ^verse-10

**11**  And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. ^verse-11

**12**  But when they believed Philip [[#^note-12a|preaching]] the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the [[#^note-12b|name]] of Jesus Christ, they were [[#^note-12c|baptized]], both men and women. ^verse-12

**13**  Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and [[#^note-13a|wondered]], beholding the miracles and signs which were done. ^verse-13

**14**  Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the [[#^note-14a|word]] of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: ^verse-14

**15**  Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: ^verse-15

**16**  (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ^verse-16

**17**  Then [[#^note-17a|laid]] they their hands on them, and they received the [[#^note-17b|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And when Simon saw that through [[#^note-18a|laying]] on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, ^verse-18

**19**  Saying, Give me also this [[#^note-19a|power]], that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. ^verse-19

**20**  But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the [[#^note-20a|gift]] of God may be [[#^note-20b|purchased]] with money. ^verse-20

**21**  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not [[#^note-21a|right]] in the sight of God. ^verse-21

**22**  Repent therefore of this thy [[#^note-22a|wickedness]], and pray God, if perhaps the [[#^note-22b|thought]] of thine [[#^note-22c|heart]] may be forgiven thee. ^verse-22

**23**  For I perceive that thou art in the [[#^note-23a|gall of bitterness]], and in the [[#^note-23b|bond]] of iniquity. ^verse-23

**24**  Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. ^verse-24

**25**  And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. ^verse-25

**26**  And the [[#^note-26a|angel]] of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. ^verse-26

**27**  And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to [[#^note-27a|worship]], ^verse-27

**28**  Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. ^verse-28

**29**  Then the [[#^note-29a|Spirit]] said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. ^verse-29

**30**  And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? ^verse-30

**31**  And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. ^verse-31

**32**  The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a [[#^note-32a|lamb]] dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: ^verse-32

**33**  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. ^verse-33

**34**  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? ^verse-34

**35**  Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him [[#^note-35a|Jesus]]. ^verse-35

**36**  And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? ^verse-36

**37**  And Philip said, If thou [[#^note-37a|believest]] with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. ^verse-37

**38**  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he [[#^note-38a|baptized]] him. ^verse-38

**39**  And when they were come up out of the water, the [[#^note-39a|Spirit]] of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. ^verse-39

**40**  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to [[#^note-40a|Cæsarea]]. ^verse-40
