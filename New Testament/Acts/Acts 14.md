### Chapter 14

[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 13|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 15|Next Entry]]

*Persecution attends the spread of the gospel—Paul heals a crippled man; Paul and Barnabas are hailed as gods—Paul is stoned and revived; he preaches—Elders are ordained.*

**1**  And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. ^verse-1

**2**  But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. ^verse-2

**3**  Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave [[#^note-3a|testimony]] unto the word of his [[#^note-3b|grace]], and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. ^verse-3

**4**  But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. ^verse-4

**5**  And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the [[#^note-5a|Jews]] with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, ^verse-5

**6**  They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: ^verse-6

**7**  And there they preached the gospel. ^verse-7

**8**  ¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a [[#^note-8a|cripple]] from his mother's womb, who never had walked: ^verse-8

**9**  The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had [[#^note-9a|faith]] to be [[#^note-9b|healed]], ^verse-9

**10**  Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. ^verse-10

**11**  And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The [[#^note-11a|gods]] are come down to us in the likeness of men. ^verse-11

**12**  And they called Barnabas, [[#^note-12a|Jupiter]]; and Paul, [[#^note-12b|Mercurius]], because he was the chief speaker. ^verse-12

**13**  Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. ^verse-13

**14**  Which when the [[#^note-14a|apostles]], Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, ^verse-14

**15**  And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are [[#^note-15a|men]] of like [[#^note-15b|passions]] with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these [[#^note-15c|vanities]] unto the living God, which [[#^note-15d|made]] heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: ^verse-15

**16**  Who in times past suffered all nations to [[#^note-16a|walk]] in their own [[#^note-16b|ways]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Nevertheless he left not himself without [[#^note-17a|witness]], in that he did good, and gave us [[#^note-17b|rain]] from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with [[#^note-17c|food]] and gladness. ^verse-17

**18**  And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. ^verse-18

**19**  ¶ And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having [[#^note-19a|stoned]] Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. ^verse-19

**20**  Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. ^verse-20

**21**  And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, ^verse-21

**22**  Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much [[#^note-22a|tribulation]] enter into the kingdom of God. ^verse-22

**23**  And when they had [[#^note-23a|ordained]] them [[#^note-23b|elders]] in every church, and had prayed with [[#^note-23c|fasting]], they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. ^verse-23

**24**  And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. ^verse-24

**25**  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: ^verse-25

**26**  And thence sailed to [[#^note-26a|Antioch]], from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. ^verse-26

**27**  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the [[#^note-27a|door]] of faith unto the Gentiles. ^verse-27

**28**  And there they abode long time with the disciples. ^verse-28
