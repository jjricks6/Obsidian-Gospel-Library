[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Romans|Next Entry]]

*Paul is unharmed by a viper's bite—He heals the sick in Melita—He preaches in Rome, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.*

**1**  And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|barbarous]] people shewed us no little [[#^note-2b|kindness]]: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. ^verse-2

**3**  And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a [[#^note-3a|viper]] out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. ^verse-3

**4**  And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. ^verse-4

**5**  And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no [[#^note-5a|harm]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a [[#^note-6a|god]]. ^verse-6

**7**  In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days [[#^note-7a|courteously]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay [[#^note-8a|sick]] of a fever and of a [[#^note-8b|bloody flux]]: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his [[#^note-8c|hands]] on him, and healed him. ^verse-8

**9**  So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: ^verse-9

**10**  Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. ^verse-10

**11**  And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. ^verse-11

**12**  And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. ^verse-12

**13**  And from thence we [[#^note-13a|fetched a compass]], and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: ^verse-13

**14**  Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. ^verse-14

**15**  And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he [[#^note-15a|thanked]] God, and took [[#^note-15b|courage]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. ^verse-17

**18**  Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. ^verse-18

**19**  But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. ^verse-19

**20**  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the [[#^note-20a|hope]] of Israel I am bound with this chain. ^verse-20

**21**  And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. ^verse-21

**22**  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. ^verse-22

**23**  And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he [[#^note-23a|expounded]] and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the [[#^note-23b|prophets]], from morning till evening. ^verse-23

**24**  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some [[#^note-24a|believed not]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well [[#^note-25a|spake]] the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, ^verse-25

**26**  Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not [[#^note-26a|perceive]]: ^verse-26

**27**  For the [[#^note-27a|heart]] of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their [[#^note-27b|eyes]] have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. ^verse-27

**28**  Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the [[#^note-28a|Gentiles]], and that they will hear it. ^verse-28

**29**  And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. ^verse-29

**30**  And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, ^verse-30

**31**  Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. ^verse-31
