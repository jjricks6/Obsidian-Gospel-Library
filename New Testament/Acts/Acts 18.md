*Being rejected by the Jews, Paul turns to the Gentiles—He preaches, ministers, and travels—Apollos also preaches with power.*

**1**  After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; ^verse-1

**2**  And found a certain Jew named [[#^note-2a|Aquila]], born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. ^verse-2

**3**  And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and [[#^note-3a|wrought]]: for by their occupation they were [[#^note-3b|tentmakers]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And he reasoned in the [[#^note-4a|synagogue]] every [[#^note-4b|sabbath]], and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. ^verse-4

**5**  And when Silas and [[#^note-5a|Timotheus]] were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and [[#^note-5b|testified]] to the Jews that Jesus was [[#^note-5c|Christ]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he [[#^note-6a|shook]] his raiment, and said unto them, Your [[#^note-6b|blood]] be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. ^verse-6

**7**  ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. ^verse-7

**8**  And [[#^note-8a|Crispus]], the chief ruler of the synagogue, [[#^note-8b|believed]] on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. ^verse-8

**9**  Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a [[#^note-9a|vision]], Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: ^verse-9

**10**  For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much [[#^note-10a|people]] in this city. ^verse-10

**11**  And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. ^verse-11

**12**  ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, ^verse-12

**13**  Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to [[#^note-13a|worship]] God contrary to the law. ^verse-13

**14**  And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or [[#^note-14a|wicked]] [[#^note-14b|lewdness]], O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: ^verse-14

**15**  But if it be a [[#^note-15a|question]] of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. ^verse-15

**16**  And he drave them from the judgment seat. ^verse-16

**17**  Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. ^verse-17

**18**  ¶ And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a [[#^note-18a|vow]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and [[#^note-19a|reasoned]] with the Jews. ^verse-19

**20**  When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; ^verse-20

**21**  But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. ^verse-21

**22**  And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. ^verse-22

**23**  And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. ^verse-23

**24**  ¶ And a certain Jew named [[#^note-24a|Apollos]], born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and [[#^note-24b|mighty]] in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. ^verse-24

**25**  This man was [[#^note-25a|instructed]] in the way of the Lord; and being [[#^note-25b|fervent]] in the spirit, he spake and taught [[#^note-25c|diligently]] the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of [[#^note-25d|John]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. ^verse-26

**27**  And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren [[#^note-27a|wrote]], exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: ^verse-27

**28**  For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, [[#^note-28a|shewing]] by the scriptures that [[#^note-28b|Jesus was Christ]]. ^verse-28
