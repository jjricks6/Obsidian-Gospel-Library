*Paul raises Eutychus from death—Paul is free from the blood of all men—He predicts apostasy from within the Church—He reveals a teaching from Jesus, It is more blessed to give than to receive.*

**1**  And after the [[#^note-1a|uproar]] was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and [[#^note-1b|embraced them]], and departed for to go into Macedonia. ^verse-1

**2**  And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, ^verse-2

**3**  And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. ^verse-3

**4**  And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, [[#^note-4a|Aristarchus]] and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and [[#^note-4b|Timotheus]]; and of Asia, [[#^note-4c|Tychicus]] and [[#^note-4d|Trophimus]]. ^verse-4

**5**  These going before tarried for us at Troas. ^verse-5

**6**  And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of [[#^note-6a|unleavened]] bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. ^verse-6

**7**  And upon the [[#^note-7a|first]] [[#^note-7b|day]] of the week, when the disciples came [[#^note-7c|together]] to [[#^note-7d|break]] [[#^note-7e|bread]], Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. ^verse-7

**8**  And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. ^verse-8

**9**  And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. ^verse-9

**10**  And Paul went down, and fell on him, and [[#^note-10a|embracing]] him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. ^verse-10

**11**  When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. ^verse-11

**12**  And they brought the young man [[#^note-12a|alive]], and were not a little comforted. ^verse-12

**13**  ¶ And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to [[#^note-13a|go afoot]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. ^verse-14

**15**  And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. ^verse-15

**16**  For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he [[#^note-16a|hasted]], if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of [[#^note-16b|Pentecost]]. ^verse-16

**17**  ¶ And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the [[#^note-17a|elders]] of the church. ^verse-17

**18**  And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Serving]] the Lord with all [[#^note-19b|humility]] of mind, and with many [[#^note-19c|tears]], and [[#^note-19d|temptations]], which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: ^verse-19

**20**  And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, ^verse-20

**21**  Testifying both to the Jews, [[#^note-21a|and]] also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord [[#^note-21b|Jesus Christ]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And now, behold, I go bound in the [[#^note-22a|spirit]] unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: ^verse-22

**23**  Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and [[#^note-23a|afflictions]] [[#^note-23b|abide me]]. ^verse-23

**24**  But none of these things [[#^note-24a|move]] me, neither count I my [[#^note-24b|life]] dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the [[#^note-24c|gospel]] of the [[#^note-24d|grace]] of God. ^verse-24

**25**  And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. ^verse-25

**26**  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the [[#^note-26a|blood]] of all men. ^verse-26

**27**  For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the [[#^note-27a|counsel]] of God. ^verse-27

**28**  ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the [[#^note-28a|flock]], over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you [[#^note-28b|overseers]], to feed the [[#^note-28c|church]] of God, which he hath purchased with his own [[#^note-28d|blood]]. ^verse-28

**29**  For I know this, that after my departing shall [[#^note-29a|grievous]] wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. ^verse-29

**30**  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking [[#^note-30a|perverse]] things, to [[#^note-30b|draw]] away disciples after them. ^verse-30

**31**  Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to [[#^note-31a|warn]] every one night and day with tears. ^verse-31

**32**  And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an [[#^note-32a|inheritance]] among all them which are sanctified. ^verse-32

**33**  I have [[#^note-33a|coveted]] no man's silver, or [[#^note-33b|gold]], or apparel. ^verse-33

**34**  Yea, ye yourselves know, that these [[#^note-34a|hands]] have [[#^note-34b|ministered]] unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. ^verse-34

**35**  I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to [[#^note-35a|give]] than to receive. ^verse-35

**36**  ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. ^verse-36

**37**  And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, ^verse-37

**38**  [[#^note-38a|Sorrowing]] most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship. ^verse-38
