[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 21|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 23|Next Entry]]

*Paul recounts the story of his conversion and also tells of seeing Jesus in a visionâ€”He is accorded some privileges as a Roman citizen.*

**1**  Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. ^verse-1

**2**  (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,) ^verse-2

**3**  I am verily a man which am a [[#^note-3a|Jew]], born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the [[#^note-3b|feet]] of [[#^note-3c|Gamaliel]], and taught according to the perfect manner of the [[#^note-3d|law]] of the fathers, and was [[#^note-3e|zealous]] toward God, as ye all are this day. ^verse-3

**4**  And I [[#^note-4a|persecuted]] this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. ^verse-4

**5**  As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received [[#^note-5a|letters]] unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished. ^verse-5

**6**  And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great [[#^note-6a|light]] round about me. ^verse-6

**7**  And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, [[#^note-7a|Saul]], Saul, why persecutest thou me? ^verse-7

**8**  And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am [[#^note-8a|Jesus]] of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. ^verse-8

**9**  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the [[#^note-9a|voice]] of him that spake to me. ^verse-9

**10**  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. ^verse-10

**11**  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. ^verse-11

**12**  And one [[#^note-12a|Ananias]], a devout man according to the law, having a good [[#^note-12b|report]] of all the Jews which dwelt there, ^verse-12

**13**  Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy [[#^note-13a|sight]]. And the same hour I looked up upon him. ^verse-13

**14**  And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his [[#^note-14a|will]], and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. ^verse-14

**15**  For thou shalt be his [[#^note-15a|witness]] unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. ^verse-15

**16**  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be [[#^note-16a|baptized]], and [[#^note-16b|wash]] away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a [[#^note-17a|trance]]; ^verse-17

**18**  And [[#^note-18a|saw]] him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. ^verse-18

**19**  And I said, Lord, they know that I [[#^note-19a|imprisoned]] and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: ^verse-19

**20**  And when the blood of thy [[#^note-20a|martyr]] Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and [[#^note-20b|consenting]] unto his death, and kept the [[#^note-20c|raiment]] of them that slew him. ^verse-20

**21**  And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the [[#^note-21a|Gentiles]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And they gave him [[#^note-22a|audience]] unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. ^verse-22

**23**  And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, ^verse-23

**24**  The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the [[#^note-24a|castle]], and bade that he should be examined by [[#^note-24b|scourging]]; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. ^verse-24

**25**  And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a [[#^note-25a|Roman]], and uncondemned? ^verse-25

**26**  When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. ^verse-26

**27**  Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. ^verse-27

**28**  And the [[#^note-28a|chief]] captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. ^verse-28

**29**  [[#^note-29a|Then]] straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. ^verse-29

**30**  On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was [[#^note-30a|accused]] of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. ^verse-30
