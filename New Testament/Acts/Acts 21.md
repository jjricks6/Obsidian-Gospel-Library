*Paul journeys to Jerusalem—He is persecuted, arrested, and bound.*

**1**  And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: ^verse-1

**2**  And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. ^verse-2

**3**  Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. ^verse-3

**4**  And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the [[#^note-4a|Spirit]], that he should not go up to Jerusalem. ^verse-4

**5**  And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. ^verse-5

**6**  And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again. ^verse-6

**7**  And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. ^verse-7

**8**  And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto [[#^note-8a|Cæsarea]]: and we entered into the house of [[#^note-8b|Philip]] the [[#^note-8c|evangelist]], which was one of the seven; and abode with him. ^verse-8

**9**  And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did [[#^note-9a|prophesy]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus. ^verse-10

**11**  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the [[#^note-11a|Holy Ghost]], So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. ^verse-11

**12**  And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. ^verse-12

**13**  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to [[#^note-13a|die]] at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-13

**14**  And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The [[#^note-14a|will]] of the Lord be done. ^verse-14

**15**  And after those days we [[#^note-15a|took up our carriages]], and went up to Jerusalem. ^verse-15

**16**  There went with us also certain of the disciples of Cæsarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an [[#^note-16a|old]] disciple, with whom we should lodge. ^verse-16

**17**  And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. ^verse-17

**18**  And the day following Paul went in with us unto [[#^note-18a|James]]; and all the elders were present. ^verse-18

**19**  And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the [[#^note-19a|Gentiles]] by his ministry. ^verse-19

**20**  And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all [[#^note-20a|zealous]] of the law: ^verse-20

**21**  And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to [[#^note-21a|circumcise]] their children, neither to walk after the [[#^note-21b|customs]]. ^verse-21

**22**  What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. ^verse-22

**23**  Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a [[#^note-23a|vow]] on them; ^verse-23

**24**  Them take, and purify thyself with them, and [[#^note-24a|be]] at charges with them, that they may [[#^note-24b|shave]] their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. ^verse-24

**25**  As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to [[#^note-25a|idols]], and from blood, and from strangled, and from [[#^note-25b|fornication]]. ^verse-25

**26**  Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the [[#^note-26a|accomplishment]] of the days of [[#^note-26b|purification]], until that an [[#^note-26c|offering]] should be offered for every one of them. ^verse-26

**27**  And when the [[#^note-27a|seven]] days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, ^verse-27

**28**  Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the [[#^note-28a|temple]], and hath [[#^note-28b|polluted]] this holy place. ^verse-28

**29**  (For they had seen before with him in the city [[#^note-29a|Trophimus]] an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.) ^verse-29

**30**  And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. ^verse-30

**31**  And as they went about to [[#^note-31a|kill]] him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an [[#^note-31b|uproar]]. ^verse-31

**32**  Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief [[#^note-32a|captain]] and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. ^verse-32

**33**  Then the chief [[#^note-33a|captain]] came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. ^verse-33

**34**  And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the [[#^note-34a|castle]]. ^verse-34

**35**  And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. ^verse-35

**36**  For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. ^verse-36

**37**  And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? ^verse-37

**38**  Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? ^verse-38

**39**  But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of [[#^note-39a|Tarsus]], a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. ^verse-39

**40**  And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and [[#^note-40a|beckoned]] with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great [[#^note-40b|silence]], he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, ^verse-40
