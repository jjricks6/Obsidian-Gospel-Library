[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 1|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 3|Next Entry]]

*The Spirit is poured out on the day of Pentecost—Peter testifies of Jesus' resurrection—He tells how to gain salvation and speaks of the gift of the Holy Ghost—Many believe and are baptized.*

**1**  And when the day of [[#^note-1a|Pentecost]] was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. ^verse-1

**2**  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty [[#^note-2a|wind]], and it filled all the house where they were sitting. ^verse-2

**3**  And there appeared unto them [[#^note-3a|cloven]] tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. ^verse-3

**4**  And they were all filled with the [[#^note-4a|Holy Ghost]], and began to speak with other [[#^note-4b|tongues]], as the [[#^note-4c|Spirit]] gave them utterance. ^verse-4

**5**  And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. ^verse-5

**6**  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own [[#^note-6a|language]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilæans? ^verse-7

**8**  And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? ^verse-8

**9**  Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, ^verse-9

**10**  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and [[#^note-10a|proselytes]], ^verse-10

**11**  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our [[#^note-11a|tongues]] the wonderful works of God. ^verse-11

**12**  And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? ^verse-12

**13**  Others [[#^note-13a|mocking]] said, These men are full of new wine. ^verse-13

**14**  ¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judæa, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: ^verse-14

**15**  For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. ^verse-15

**16**  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet [[#^note-16a|Joel]]; ^verse-16

**17**  And it shall come to pass in the [[#^note-17a|last days]], saith God, I will [[#^note-17b|pour out]] of my [[#^note-17c|Spirit]] upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall [[#^note-17d|prophesy]], and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall [[#^note-17e|dream]] dreams: ^verse-17

**18**  And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall [[#^note-18a|prophesy]]: ^verse-18

**19**  And I will shew [[#^note-19a|wonders]] in heaven above, and [[#^note-19b|signs]] in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: ^verse-19

**20**  The sun shall be turned into [[#^note-20a|darkness]], and the moon into blood, before that great and [[#^note-20b|notable]] [[#^note-20c|day]] of the Lord come: ^verse-20

**21**  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be [[#^note-21a|saved]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man [[#^note-22a|approved]] of God among you by [[#^note-22b|miracles]] and wonders and signs, which [[#^note-22c|God]] did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: ^verse-22

**23**  Him, being delivered by the [[#^note-23a|determinate counsel]] and [[#^note-23b|foreknowledge]] of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have [[#^note-23c|crucified]] and slain: ^verse-23

**24**  Whom God hath [[#^note-24a|raised]] up, having loosed the [[#^note-24b|pains]] of [[#^note-24c|death]]: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. ^verse-24

**25**  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the [[#^note-25a|Lord]] always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: ^verse-26

**27**  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in [[#^note-27a|hell]], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see [[#^note-27b|corruption]]. ^verse-27

**28**  Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. ^verse-28

**29**  Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the [[#^note-29a|patriarch]] David, that he is both dead and [[#^note-29b|buried]], and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. ^verse-29

**30**  Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an [[#^note-30a|oath]] to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up [[#^note-30b|Christ]] to sit on his throne; ^verse-30

**31**  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. ^verse-31

**32**  This Jesus hath God [[#^note-32a|raised]] up, whereof we all are [[#^note-32b|witnesses]]. ^verse-32

**33**  Therefore being [[#^note-33a|by]] the [[#^note-33b|right hand]] of God [[#^note-33c|exalted]], and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath [[#^note-33d|shed]] forth this, which ye now see and hear. ^verse-33

**34**  For [[#^note-34a|David]] is not [[#^note-34b|ascended]] into the heavens: but he saith himself, The [[#^note-34c|Lord]] said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, ^verse-34

**35**  Until I make thy foes thy footstool. ^verse-35

**36**  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have [[#^note-36a|crucified]], both [[#^note-36b|Lord]] and Christ. ^verse-36

**37**  ¶ Now when they heard this, they were [[#^note-37a|pricked]] in their [[#^note-37b|heart]], and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, [[#^note-37c|what]] shall we do? ^verse-37

**38**    Then Peter [[#^note-38a|said]] unto them, [[#^note-38b|Repent]], and be [[#^note-38c|baptized]] every one of you in the [[#^note-38d|name]] of Jesus Christ for the [[#^note-38e|remission]] of sins, and ye shall receive the [[#^note-38f|gift]] of the [[#^note-38g|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-38

**39**  For the [[#^note-39a|promise]] is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are [[#^note-39b|afar]] off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. ^verse-39

**40**  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, [[#^note-40a|Save]] yourselves from this [[#^note-40b|untoward]] generation. ^verse-40

**41**  ¶ Then they that gladly [[#^note-41a|received]] his [[#^note-41b|word]] were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about [[#^note-41c|three]] thousand souls. ^verse-41

**42**  And they continued [[#^note-42a|steadfastly]] in the apostles' doctrine and [[#^note-42b|fellowship]], and in breaking of [[#^note-42c|bread]], and in prayers. ^verse-42

**43**  And [[#^note-43a|fear]] came upon every soul: and many wonders and [[#^note-43b|signs]] were done by the apostles. ^verse-43

**44**  And all that believed were together, and had all things [[#^note-44a|common]]; ^verse-44

**45**  And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had [[#^note-45a|need]]. ^verse-45

**46**  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the [[#^note-46a|temple]], and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and [[#^note-46b|singleness]] of heart, ^verse-46

**47**  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord [[#^note-47a|added]] to the [[#^note-47b|church]] daily such as should be saved. ^verse-47
