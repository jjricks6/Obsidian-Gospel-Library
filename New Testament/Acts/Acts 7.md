### Chapter 7

[[New Testament/Acts/Acts 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[New Testament/Acts/Acts 8|Next Entry]]

*Stephen recounts the history of Israel and names Moses as a prototype of Christ—He testifies of the apostasy in Israel—He sees Jesus on the right hand of God—Stephen's testimony is rejected, and he is stoned to death.*

**1**  Then said the high priest, Are these things so? ^verse-1

**2**  And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father [[#^note-2a|Abraham]], when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in [[#^note-2b|Charran]], ^verse-2

**3**  And said unto him, Get thee out of thy [[#^note-3a|country]], and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Then came he out of the land of the [[#^note-4a|Chaldæans]], and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. ^verse-4

**5**  And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he [[#^note-5a|promised]] that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. ^verse-5

**6**  And God spake on this wise, That his seed should [[#^note-6a|sojourn]] in a strange land; and that they should bring them into [[#^note-6b|bondage]], and entreat them evil four hundred years. ^verse-6

**7**  And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. ^verse-7

**8**  And he gave him the covenant of [[#^note-8a|circumcision]]: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve [[#^note-8b|patriarchs]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And the patriarchs, moved with [[#^note-9a|envy]], sold [[#^note-9b|Joseph]] into Egypt: but God was with him, ^verse-9

**10**  And [[#^note-10a|delivered]] him out of all his [[#^note-10b|afflictions]], and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. ^verse-10

**11**  Now there came a [[#^note-11a|dearth]] over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. ^verse-11

**12**  But when Jacob heard that there was [[#^note-12a|corn]] in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. ^verse-12

**13**  And at the second time [[#^note-13a|Joseph]] was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto [[#^note-13b|Pharaoh]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Then sent [[#^note-14a|Joseph]], and called his [[#^note-14b|father]] [[#^note-14c|Jacob]] to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. ^verse-14

**15**  So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, ^verse-15

**16**  And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham [[#^note-16a|bought]] for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. ^verse-16

**17**  But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, ^verse-17

**18**  Till another [[#^note-18a|king]] arose, which knew not Joseph. ^verse-18

**19**  The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. ^verse-19

**20**  In which time Moses was born, and was [[#^note-20a|exceeding fair]], and nourished up in his father's house [[#^note-20b|three]] months: ^verse-20

**21**  And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own [[#^note-21a|son]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And Moses was [[#^note-22a|learned]] in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. ^verse-22

**23**  And when he was full [[#^note-23a|forty]] years old, it came into his heart to visit his [[#^note-23b|brethren]] the children of Israel. ^verse-23

**24**  And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was [[#^note-24a|oppressed]], and [[#^note-24b|smote]] the Egyptian: ^verse-24

**25**  For he supposed his brethren would have [[#^note-25a|understood]] how that God by his hand would [[#^note-25b|deliver]] them: but they understood not. ^verse-25

**26**  And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye [[#^note-26a|wrong]] one to another? ^verse-26

**27**  But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a [[#^note-27a|ruler]] and a judge over us? ^verse-27

**28**  Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? ^verse-28

**29**  Then [[#^note-29a|fled]] Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two [[#^note-29b|sons]]. ^verse-29

**30**    And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an [[#^note-30a|angel]] of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. ^verse-30

**31**  When Moses saw it, he wondered at the [[#^note-31a|sight]]: and as he drew near to behold it, the [[#^note-31b|voice]] of the Lord came unto him, ^verse-31

**32**  Saying, I am the [[#^note-32a|God]] of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. ^verse-32

**33**  Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. ^verse-33

**34**  I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. ^verse-34

**35**  This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a [[#^note-35a|deliverer]] by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. ^verse-35

**36**  He [[#^note-36a|brought]] them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. ^verse-36

**37**  ¶ This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A [[#^note-37a|prophet]] shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. ^verse-37

**38**  This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively [[#^note-38a|oracles]] to give unto us: ^verse-38

**39**  To whom our fathers would not [[#^note-39a|obey]], but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, ^verse-39

**40**  Saying unto Aaron, Make us [[#^note-40a|gods]] to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. ^verse-40

**41**  And they made a [[#^note-41a|calf]] in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. ^verse-41

**42**  Then God turned, and [[#^note-42a|gave]] them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? ^verse-42

**43**  Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. ^verse-43

**44**  Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the [[#^note-44a|fashion]] that he had seen. ^verse-44

**45**  Which also our fathers that came after brought in with [[#^note-45a|Jesus]] into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; ^verse-45

**46**  Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. ^verse-46

**47**  But Solomon built him an house. ^verse-47

**48**  Howbeit the most High [[#^note-48a|dwelleth]] not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, ^verse-48

**49**  Heaven is my [[#^note-49a|throne]], and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? ^verse-49

**50**  Hath not my hand [[#^note-50a|made]] all these things? ^verse-50

**51**  ¶ Ye [[#^note-51a|stiffnecked]] and [[#^note-51b|uncircumcised]] in heart and ears, ye do always [[#^note-51c|resist]] the [[#^note-51d|Holy Ghost]]: as your [[#^note-51e|fathers]] did, so do ye. ^verse-51

**52**  Which of the prophets have not your fathers [[#^note-52a|persecuted]]? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: ^verse-52

**53**  Who have received the law by the disposition of [[#^note-53a|angels]], and have not [[#^note-53b|kept]] it. ^verse-53

**54**    ¶ When they heard these things, they were [[#^note-54a|cut]] to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. ^verse-54

**55**  But he, being full of the [[#^note-55a|Holy Ghost]], looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the [[#^note-55b|glory]] of [[#^note-55c|God]], and [[#^note-55d|Jesus]] [[#^note-55e|standing]] on the [[#^note-55f|right hand]] of God, ^verse-55

**56**  And said, Behold, I [[#^note-56a|see]] the heavens [[#^note-56b|opened]], and the [[#^note-56c|Son of man]] standing on the right [[#^note-56d|hand]] of [[#^note-56e|God]]. ^verse-56

**57**  Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, ^verse-57

**58**  And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their [[#^note-58a|clothes]] at a [[#^note-58b|young man's]] feet, whose name was Saul. ^verse-58

**59**  And they [[#^note-59a|stoned]] [[#^note-59b|Stephen]], [[#^note-59c|calling]] upon [[#^note-59d|God]], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my [[#^note-59e|spirit]]. ^verse-59

**60**  And he kneeled down, and [[#^note-60a|cried]] with a loud voice, [[#^note-60b|Lord]], lay not this sin to their [[#^note-60c|charge]]. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. ^verse-60
