*The Gods finish Their planning of the creation of all things—They bring to pass the Creation according to Their plans—Adam names every living creature.*

**1**  And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the [[#^note-1a|hosts]] of them. ^verse-1

**2**  And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled; and we will [[#^note-2a|rest]] on the [[#^note-2b|seventh]] time from all our work which we have counseled. ^verse-2

**3**  And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would [[#^note-3a|rest]] from all their [[#^note-3b|works]] which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and [[#^note-3c|sanctified]] it. And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth. ^verse-3

**4**  And the [[#^note-4a|Gods]] came down and formed these the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were formed in the day that the Gods formed the earth and the heavens, ^verse-4

**5**  According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the [[#^note-5a|earth]], and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them, and had not formed a man to till the ground. ^verse-5

**6**  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. ^verse-6

**7**  And the [[#^note-7a|Gods]] formed man from the [[#^note-7b|dust]] of the ground, and took his [[#^note-7c|spirit]] (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living [[#^note-7d|soul]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in [[#^note-8a|Eden]], and there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed. ^verse-8

**9**  And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the [[#^note-9a|tree of life]], also, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. ^verse-9

**10**  There was a river running out of Eden, to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads. ^verse-10

**11**  And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. ^verse-11

**12**  And the Gods commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, ^verse-12

**13**  But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the [[#^note-13a|time]] that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord's time, which was after the time of [[#^note-13b|Kolob]]; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning. ^verse-13

**14**  And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will form an help meet for him. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Gods caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and they took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof; ^verse-15

**16**  And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man, formed they a [[#^note-16a|woman]], and brought her unto the man. ^verse-16

**17**  And Adam said: This was bone of my bones, and [[#^note-17a|flesh]] of my flesh; now she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man; ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall [[#^note-18a|cleave]] unto his wife, and they shall be [[#^note-18b|one]] flesh. ^verse-18

**19**  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not [[#^note-19a|ashamed]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto [[#^note-20a|Adam]] to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof. ^verse-20

**21**  And Adam gave [[#^note-21a|names]] to all [[#^note-21b|cattle]], to the fowl of the air, to every beast of the field; and for Adam, there was found an [[#^note-21c|help]] meet for him. ^verse-21
