*Abraham learns about the sun, moon, and stars by means of the Urim and Thummim—The Lord reveals to him the eternal nature of spirits—He learns of pre-earth life, foreordination, the Creation, the choosing of a Redeemer, and the second estate of man.*

**1**  And I, Abraham, had the [[#^note-1a|Urim and Thummim]], which the Lord my God had given unto me, in Ur of the Chaldees; ^verse-1

**2**  And I saw the [[#^note-2a|stars]], that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it; ^verse-2

**3**  And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is [[#^note-3a|Kolob]], because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest. ^verse-3

**4**  And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its [[#^note-4a|times]] and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a [[#^note-4b|day]] unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand [[#^note-4c|years]] according to the [[#^note-4d|time]] appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning of Kolob. ^verse-4

**5**  And the Lord said unto me: The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule the day, even the night, is above or [[#^note-5a|greater]] than that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning, for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of days, and of months, and of years. ^verse-5

**6**  And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these [[#^note-6a|two]] facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth upon which thou standest, and the set time of the greater light which is set to rule the day, and the set time of the lesser light which is set to rule the night. ^verse-6

**7**  Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the time of the earth upon which thou standest. ^verse-7

**8**  And where these two facts exist, there shall be another fact above them, that is, there shall be another planet whose reckoning of time shall be longer still; ^verse-8

**9**  And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one [[#^note-9a|planet]] above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord's time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same [[#^note-9b|order]] as that upon which thou standest. ^verse-9

**10**  And it is given unto thee to know the set time of all the stars that are set to give light, until thou come near unto the throne of God. ^verse-10

**11**  Thus I, Abraham, [[#^note-11a|talked]] with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made; ^verse-11

**12**  And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof. ^verse-12

**13**  And he said unto me: This is Shinehah, which is the sun. And he said unto me: Kokob, which is star. And he said unto me: Olea, which is the moon. And he said unto me: Kokaubeam, which signifies stars, or all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven. ^verse-13

**14**  And it was in the night time when the Lord spake these words unto me: I will [[#^note-14a|multiply]] thee, and thy [[#^note-14b|seed]] after thee, like unto these; and if thou canst count the [[#^note-14c|number]] of sands, so shall be the number of thy seeds. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord said unto me: Abraham, I [[#^note-15a|show]] these things unto thee before ye go into Egypt, that ye may declare all these words. ^verse-15

**16**  If [[#^note-16a|two]] things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things above them; therefore [[#^note-16b|Kolob]] is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me. ^verse-16

**17**  Now, if there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may be that a planet or a star may exist above it; and there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to [[#^note-17a|do]] but what he will do it. ^verse-17

**18**  Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there be two [[#^note-18a|spirits]], and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are [[#^note-18b|gnolaum]], or eternal. ^verse-18

**19**  And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being [[#^note-19a|more intelligent]] than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all. ^verse-19

**20**  The Lord thy God sent his angel to [[#^note-20a|deliver]] thee from the hands of the priest of Elkenah. ^verse-20

**21**  I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, therefore, have come down unto thee to declare unto thee the [[#^note-21a|works]] which my hands have made, wherein my [[#^note-21b|wisdom]] excelleth them all, for I [[#^note-21c|rule]] in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen. ^verse-21

**22**  Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the [[#^note-22a|intelligences]] that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the [[#^note-22b|noble]] and great ones; ^verse-22

**23**  And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast [[#^note-23a|chosen]] before thou wast born. ^verse-23

**24**  And there stood [[#^note-24a|one]] among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who [[#^note-24b|we]]re with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may [[#^note-24c|dwell]]; ^verse-24

**25**  And we will [[#^note-25a|prove]] them herewith, to see if they will [[#^note-25b|do]] all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; ^verse-25

**26**  And they who [[#^note-26a|keep]] their first [[#^note-26b|estate]] shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first [[#^note-26c|estate]] shall not have [[#^note-26d|glory]] in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. ^verse-26

**27**  And the [[#^note-27a|Lord]] said: Whom shall I [[#^note-27b|send]]? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And [[#^note-27c|another]] answered and said: Here am I, [[#^note-27d|send]] me. And the Lord said: I will send the first. ^verse-27

**28**  And the [[#^note-28a|second]] was angry, and kept not his first [[#^note-28b|estate]]; and, at that day, many followed after him. ^verse-28
