*God created all things spiritually before they were naturally upon the earth—He created man, the first flesh, upon the earth—Woman is a help meet for man.*

**1**  Thus the [[#^note-1a|heaven]] and the earth were finished, and all the [[#^note-1b|host]] of them. ^verse-1

**2**  And on the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I [[#^note-2a|rested]] on the [[#^note-2b|seventh day]] from all my work, and all things which I had made were finished, and I, God, saw that they were good; ^verse-2

**3**  And I, God, [[#^note-3a|blessed]] the seventh day, and [[#^note-3b|sanctified]] it; because that in it I had rested from all my [[#^note-3c|work]] which I, God, had created and made. ^verse-3

**4**  And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when they were [[#^note-4a|created]], in the day that I, the Lord God, made the [[#^note-4b|heaven]] and the earth, ^verse-4

**5**  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, [[#^note-5a|created]] all things, of which I have spoken, [[#^note-5b|spiritually]], before they were [[#^note-5c|naturally]] upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had [[#^note-5d|created]] all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the [[#^note-5e|ground]]; for in [[#^note-5f|heaven]] [[#^note-5g|created]] I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air; ^verse-5

**6**  But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a [[#^note-6a|mist]] from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. ^verse-6

**7**  And I, the Lord God, formed man from the [[#^note-7a|dust]] of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the [[#^note-7b|breath of life]]; and [[#^note-7c|man]] became a living [[#^note-7d|soul]], the [[#^note-7e|first]] flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word. ^verse-7

**8**  And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in [[#^note-8a|Eden]], and there I put the man whom I had formed. ^verse-8

**9**  And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, [[#^note-9a|naturally]], that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also a [[#^note-9b|living]] soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the [[#^note-9c|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil. ^verse-9

**10**  And I, the Lord God, caused a river to go out of [[#^note-10a|Eden]] to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four [[#^note-10b|heads]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And I, the Lord God, called the name of the first Pison, and it compasseth the whole land of [[#^note-11a|Havilah]], where I, the Lord God, created much gold; ^verse-11

**12**  And the gold of that land was good, and there was bdellium and the [[#^note-12a|onyx]] stone. ^verse-12

**13**  And the name of the second river was called Gihon; the same that compasseth the whole land of [[#^note-13a|Ethiopia]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And the name of the third river was Hiddekel; that which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was the Euphrates. ^verse-14

**15**  And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of [[#^note-15a|Eden]], to dress it, and to keep it. ^verse-15

**16**  And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, ^verse-16

**17**  But of the tree of the [[#^note-17a|knowledge]] of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest [[#^note-17b|choose]] for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I [[#^note-17c|forbid]] it, for in the [[#^note-17d|day]] thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely [[#^note-17e|die]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And I, the Lord God, said unto mine [[#^note-18a|Only Begotten]], that it was not good that the man should be [[#^note-18b|alone]]; wherefore, I will make an [[#^note-18c|help]] meet for him. ^verse-18

**19**  And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every [[#^note-19a|beast]] of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the [[#^note-19b|breath of life]], and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof. ^verse-19

**20**  And Adam gave [[#^note-20a|names]] to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him. ^verse-20

**21**  And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and I took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof; ^verse-21

**22**  And the rib which I, the Lord God, had taken from man, made I a [[#^note-22a|woman]], and brought her unto the man. ^verse-22

**23**  And [[#^note-23a|Adam]] said: This I know now is bone of my bones, and [[#^note-23b|flesh]] of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall [[#^note-24a|cleave]] unto his [[#^note-24b|wife]]; and [[#^note-24c|they]] shall be [[#^note-24d|one]] flesh. ^verse-24

**25**  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. ^verse-25
