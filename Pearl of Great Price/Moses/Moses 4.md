*How Satan became the devil—He tempts Eve—Adam and Eve fall, and death enters the world.*

**1**  And I, the [[#^note-1a|Lord God]], spake unto Moses, saying: That [[#^note-1b|Satan]], whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the [[#^note-1c|beginning]], and he came before me, saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will [[#^note-1d|redeem]] all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely [[#^note-1e|I]] will do it; wherefore [[#^note-1f|give]] me thine honor. ^verse-1

**2**  But, behold, my Beloved [[#^note-2a|Son]], which was my Beloved and [[#^note-2b|Chosen]] from the beginning, said unto me—[[#^note-2c|Father]], thy [[#^note-2d|will be]] done, and the [[#^note-2e|glory]] be thine forever. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, because that [[#^note-3a|Satan]] [[#^note-3b|rebelled]] against me, and sought to destroy the [[#^note-3c|agency]] of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be [[#^note-3d|cast down]]; ^verse-3

**4**  And he became [[#^note-4a|Satan]], yea, even the [[#^note-4b|devil]], the father of all [[#^note-4c|lies]], to [[#^note-4d|deceive]] and to blind men, and to lead them [[#^note-4e|captive]] at his will, even as many as would not [[#^note-4f|hearken]] unto my voice. ^verse-4

**5**  And now the serpent was more [[#^note-5a|subtle]] than any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had made. ^verse-5

**6**  And [[#^note-6a|Satan]] put it into the heart of the serpent, (for he had drawn away [[#^note-6b|many]] after him,) and he sought also to [[#^note-6c|beguile]] Eve, for he [[#^note-6d|knew not]] the [[#^note-6e|mind]] of God, wherefore he sought to destroy the world. ^verse-6

**7**  And he said unto the woman: Yea, hath God said—Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? (And he spake by the mouth of the serpent.) ^verse-7

**8**  And the woman said unto the serpent: We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; ^verse-8

**9**  But of the fruit of the tree which thou beholdest in the midst of the garden, God hath said—Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. ^verse-9

**10**  And the serpent said unto the [[#^note-10a|woman]]: Ye shall not surely die; ^verse-10

**11**  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your [[#^note-11a|eyes]] shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, [[#^note-11b|knowing]] good and evil. ^verse-11

**12**  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it became pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be [[#^note-12a|desired]] to make her wise, she took of the [[#^note-12b|fruit]] thereof, and did [[#^note-12c|eat]], and also gave unto her husband with her, and he did eat. ^verse-12

**13**  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they had been [[#^note-13a|naked]]. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves [[#^note-13b|aprons]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And they heard the voice of the Lord God, as they were [[#^note-14a|walking]] in the garden, in the cool of the day; and Adam and his wife went to hide themselves from the [[#^note-14b|presence]] of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. ^verse-14

**15**  And I, the Lord God, called unto Adam, and said unto him: Where [[#^note-15a|goest]] thou? ^verse-15

**16**  And he said: I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I beheld that I was naked, and I hid myself. ^verse-16

**17**  And I, the Lord God, said unto Adam: Who told thee thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, if so thou shouldst surely [[#^note-17a|die]]? ^verse-17

**18**  And the man said: The woman thou gavest me, and commandest that she should remain with me, she gave me of the fruit of the tree and I did eat. ^verse-18

**19**  And I, the Lord God, said unto the woman: What is this thing which thou hast done? And the woman said: The serpent [[#^note-19a|beguiled]] me, and I did eat. ^verse-19

**20**  And I, the Lord God, said unto the serpent: Because thou hast done this thou shalt be [[#^note-20a|cursed]] above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life; ^verse-20

**21**  And I will put [[#^note-21a|enmity]] between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed; and he shall [[#^note-21b|bruise]] thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. ^verse-21

**22**  Unto the woman, I, the Lord God, said: I will greatly multiply thy [[#^note-22a|sorrow]] and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy [[#^note-22b|husband]], and he shall rule over thee. ^verse-22

**23**  And unto Adam, I, the Lord God, said: Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the fruit of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying—Thou shalt not eat of it, [[#^note-23a|cursed]] shall be the ground for thy sake; in [[#^note-23b|sorrow]] shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. ^verse-23

**24**  Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. ^verse-24

**25**  By the [[#^note-25a|sweat]] of thy [[#^note-25b|face]] shalt thou eat bread, until thou shalt return unto the ground—for thou shalt surely die—for out of it wast thou taken: for [[#^note-25c|dust]] thou wast, and unto dust shalt thou return. ^verse-25

**26**  And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living; for thus have I, the Lord God, called the first of all women, which are [[#^note-26a|many]]. ^verse-26

**27**  Unto Adam, and also unto his wife, did I, the Lord God, make coats of [[#^note-27a|skins]], and [[#^note-27b|clothed]] them. ^verse-27

**28**  And I, the Lord God, [[#^note-28a|said]] unto mine Only Begotten: Behold, the [[#^note-28b|man]] is become as one of us to [[#^note-28c|know]] good and evil; and now lest he put forth his hand and [[#^note-28d|partake]] also of the [[#^note-28e|tree of life]], and eat and live forever, ^verse-28

**29**  Therefore I, the Lord God, will send him forth from the Garden of [[#^note-29a|Eden]], to till the ground from whence he was taken; ^verse-29

**30**  For as I, the Lord God, liveth, even so my [[#^note-30a|words]] cannot return void, for as they go forth out of my mouth they must be fulfilled. ^verse-30

**31**  So I drove out the man, and I placed at the east of the Garden of [[#^note-31a|Eden]], [[#^note-31b|cherubim]] and a flaming sword, which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. ^verse-31

**32**  (And these are the words which I spake unto my servant Moses, and they are true even as I will; and I have spoken them unto you. See thou show them unto no man, until I command you, except to them that believe. Amen.) ^verse-32
