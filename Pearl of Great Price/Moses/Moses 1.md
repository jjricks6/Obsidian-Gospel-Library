[[Pearl of Great Price/Moses|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Pearl of Great Price/Moses/Moses 2|Next Entry]]

*God reveals Himself to Moses—Moses is transfigured—He is confronted by Satan—Moses sees many inhabited worlds—Worlds without number were created by the Son—God's work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.*

**1**  The words of God, which he [[#^note-1a|spake]] unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high [[#^note-1b|mountain]], ^verse-1

**2**  And he [[#^note-2a|saw]] God [[#^note-2b|face to face]], and he [[#^note-2c|talked]] with him, and the [[#^note-2d|glory]] of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence. ^verse-2

**3**  And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God [[#^note-3a|Almighty]], and [[#^note-3b|Endless]] is my [[#^note-3c|name]]; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless? ^verse-3

**4**  And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore [[#^note-4a|look]], and I will show thee the [[#^note-4b|workmanship]] of mine [[#^note-4c|hands]]; but not all, for my [[#^note-4d|works]] are without [[#^note-4e|end]], and also my [[#^note-4f|words]], for they never cease. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, no man can behold all my [[#^note-5a|works]], except he behold all my [[#^note-5b|glory]]; and no man can [[#^note-5c|behold]] all my [[#^note-5d|glory]], and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth. ^verse-5

**6**  And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the [[#^note-6a|similitude]] of mine [[#^note-6b|Only]] [[#^note-6c|Begotten]]; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the [[#^note-6d|Savior]], for he is full of [[#^note-6e|grace]] and [[#^note-6f|truth]]; but there is [[#^note-6g|no]] God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I [[#^note-6h|know]] them all. ^verse-6

**7**  And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the [[#^note-8a|world]] upon which he was created; and Moses [[#^note-8b|beheld]] the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly [[#^note-8c|marveled]] and wondered. ^verse-8

**9**  And the [[#^note-9a|presence]] of God withdrew from Moses, that his [[#^note-9b|glory]] was not upon Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he [[#^note-9c|fell]] unto the earth. ^verse-9

**10**  And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural [[#^note-10a|strength]] like unto [[#^note-10b|man]]; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is [[#^note-10c|nothing]], which thing I never had supposed. ^verse-10

**11**  But now mine own eyes have [[#^note-11a|beheld]] God; but not my [[#^note-11b|natural]], but my [[#^note-11c|spiritual]] eyes, for my [[#^note-11d|natural]] eyes could not have [[#^note-11e|beheld]]; for I should have [[#^note-11f|withered]] and [[#^note-11g|died]] in his presence; but his [[#^note-11h|glory]] was upon me; and I beheld his [[#^note-11i|face]], for I was [[#^note-11j|transfigured]] before him. ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold, [[#^note-12a|Satan]] came [[#^note-12b|tempting]] him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me. ^verse-12

**13**  And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a [[#^note-13a|son]] of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy [[#^note-13b|glory]], that I should worship thee? ^verse-13

**14**  For behold, I could not look upon God, except his [[#^note-14a|glory]] should come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But I [[#^note-14b|can]] look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely? ^verse-14

**15**  Blessed be the name of my God, for his [[#^note-15a|Spirit]] hath not altogether withdrawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: [[#^note-15b|Worship]] God, for him only shalt thou [[#^note-15c|serve]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the [[#^note-16a|similitude]] of mine Only Begotten. ^verse-16

**17**  And he also gave me commandments when he [[#^note-17a|called]] unto me out of the burning [[#^note-17b|bush]], saying: [[#^note-17c|Call]] upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship me. ^verse-17

**18**  And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his [[#^note-18a|glory]] has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. [[#^note-18b|Depart]] hence, Satan. ^verse-18

**19**  And now, when Moses had said these words, [[#^note-19a|Satan]] cried with a loud voice, and ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the [[#^note-19b|Only Begotten]], worship me. ^verse-19

**20**  And it came to pass that Moses began to [[#^note-20a|fear]] exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of [[#^note-20b|hell]]. Nevertheless, [[#^note-20c|calling]] upon God, he received [[#^note-20d|strength]], and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of [[#^note-20e|glory]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten, [[#^note-21a|depart]] hence, [[#^note-21b|Satan]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and [[#^note-22a|gnashing]] of teeth; and he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses, that he beheld him not. ^verse-22

**23**  And now of this thing Moses bore record; but because of [[#^note-23a|wickedness]] it is [[#^note-23b|not]] had among the children of men. ^verse-23

**24**  And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the [[#^note-24a|Holy Ghost]], which beareth record of the Father and the Son; ^verse-24

**25**  And calling upon the name of God, he beheld his [[#^note-25a|glory]] again, for it was upon him; and he heard a [[#^note-25b|voice]], saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have [[#^note-25c|chosen]] thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many [[#^note-25d|waters]]; for they shall obey thy [[#^note-25e|command]] as if thou wert [[#^note-25f|God]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And lo, I am [[#^note-26a|with thee]], even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt [[#^note-26b|deliver]] my people from [[#^note-26c|bondage]], even [[#^note-26d|Israel]] my [[#^note-26e|chosen]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes and [[#^note-27a|beheld]] the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, [[#^note-27b|discerning]] it by the [[#^note-27c|Spirit]] of God. ^verse-27

**28**  And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a [[#^note-28a|soul]] which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore. ^verse-28

**29**  And he beheld many lands; and each land was called [[#^note-29a|earth]], and there were [[#^note-29b|inhabitants]] on the face thereof. ^verse-29

**30**  And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying: [[#^note-30a|Tell]] me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them? ^verse-30

**31**    And behold, the glory of the Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses stood in the presence of God, and talked with him [[#^note-31a|face to face]]. And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own [[#^note-31b|purpose]] have I made these things. Here is [[#^note-31c|wisdom]] and it remaineth in me. ^verse-31

**32**  And by the [[#^note-32a|word]] of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of [[#^note-32b|grace]] and truth. ^verse-32

**33**  And [[#^note-33a|worlds]] without number have I [[#^note-33b|created]]; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the [[#^note-33c|Son]] I [[#^note-33d|created]] them, which is mine [[#^note-33e|Only Begotten]]. ^verse-33

**34**  And the [[#^note-34a|first]] man of all men have I called [[#^note-34b|Adam]], which is [[#^note-34c|many]]. ^verse-34

**35**  But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I [[#^note-35a|know]] them. ^verse-35

**36**  And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and [[#^note-36a|tell]] me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content. ^verse-36

**37**  And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The [[#^note-37a|heavens]], they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. ^verse-37

**38**  And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no [[#^note-38a|end]] to my works, neither to my words. ^verse-38

**39**  For behold, this is my [[#^note-39a|work]] and my [[#^note-39b|glory]]—to bring to pass the [[#^note-39c|immortality]] and [[#^note-39d|eternal]] [[#^note-39e|life]] of man. ^verse-39

**40**  And now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shalt [[#^note-40a|write]] the things which I shall speak. ^verse-40

**41**  And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as [[#^note-41a|naught]] and [[#^note-41b|take]] many of them from the [[#^note-41c|book]] which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another [[#^note-41d|like]] unto thee; and they shall be [[#^note-41e|had]] again among the children of men—among as many as shall believe. ^verse-41

**42**  (These words were [[#^note-42a|spoken]] unto Moses in the mount, the name of which shall not be known among the children of men. And now they are spoken unto you. Show them not unto any except them that believe. Even so. Amen.) ^verse-42
