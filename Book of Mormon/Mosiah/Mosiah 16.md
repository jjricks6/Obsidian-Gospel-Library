### Chapter 16

[[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Mosiah/Mosiah 17|Next Entry]]

*God redeems men from their lost and fallen state—Those who are carnal remain as though there were no redemption—Christ brings to pass a resurrection to endless life or to endless damnation. About 148 B.C.*

**1**  And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the [[#^note-1a|salvation]] of the Lord; when [[#^note-1b|every]] nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall [[#^note-1c|confess]] before God that his [[#^note-1d|judgments]] are just. ^verse-1

**2**  And then shall the [[#^note-2a|wicked]] be [[#^note-2b|cast out]], and they shall have cause to howl, and [[#^note-2c|weep]], and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not [[#^note-2d|hearken]] unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not. ^verse-2

**3**  For they are [[#^note-3a|carnal]] and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did [[#^note-3b|beguile]] our first parents, which was the [[#^note-3c|cause]] of their f[[#^note-3d|all]]; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, [[#^note-3e|knowing]] evil from good, [[#^note-3f|subjecting]] themselves to the devil. ^verse-3

**4**  Thus all mankind were [[#^note-4a|lost]]; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state. ^verse-4

**5**  But remember that he that persists in his own [[#^note-5a|carnal]] nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the [[#^note-5b|devil]] hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no [[#^note-5c|redemption]] made, being an enemy to God; and also is the [[#^note-5d|devil]] an enemy to God. ^verse-5

**6**  And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come [[#^note-6a|as]] though they had already come, there could have been no redemption. ^verse-6

**7**  And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no [[#^note-7a|sting]], there could have been no resurrection. ^verse-7

**8**  But there is a [[#^note-8a|resurrection]], therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of [[#^note-8b|death]] is swallowed up in Christ. ^verse-8

**9**  He is the [[#^note-9a|light]] and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. ^verse-9

**10**  Even this mortal shall put on [[#^note-10a|immortality]], and this [[#^note-10b|corruption]] shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to [[#^note-10c|stand]] before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil— ^verse-10

**11**  If they be good, to the resurrection of [[#^note-11a|endless]] life and [[#^note-11b|happiness]]; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of [[#^note-11c|endless]] damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation— ^verse-11

**12**  Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would [[#^note-12a|not]]; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent. ^verse-12

**13**  And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved? ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore, if ye teach the [[#^note-14a|law]] of Moses, also teach that it is a [[#^note-14b|shadow]] of those things which are to come— ^verse-14

**15**  Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very [[#^note-15a|Eternal Father]]. Amen. ^verse-15
