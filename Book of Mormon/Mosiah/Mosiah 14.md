*Isaiah speaks messianically—The Messiah's humiliation and sufferings are set forth—He makes His soul an offering for sin and makes intercession for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53. About 148 B.C.*

**1**  Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath [[#^note-1a|believed]] our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? ^verse-1

**2**  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him. ^verse-2

**3**  He is [[#^note-3a|despised]] and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. ^verse-3

**4**  Surely he has [[#^note-4a|borne]] our [[#^note-4b|griefs]], and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. ^verse-4

**5**  But he was [[#^note-5a|wounded]] for our [[#^note-5b|transgressions]], he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are [[#^note-5c|healed]]. ^verse-5

**6**  All we, like [[#^note-6a|sheep]], have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all. ^verse-6

**7**  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he [[#^note-7a|opened]] not his mouth; he is brought as a [[#^note-7b|lamb]] to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth. ^verse-7

**8**  He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken. ^verse-8

**9**  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the [[#^note-9a|rich]] in his death; because he had done no [[#^note-9b|evil]], neither was any deceit in his mouth. ^verse-9

**10**  Yet it pleased the Lord to [[#^note-10a|bruise]] him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his [[#^note-10b|seed]], he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. ^verse-10

**11**  He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall [[#^note-11a|bear]] their iniquities. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the [[#^note-12a|great]], and [[#^note-12b|he]] shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made [[#^note-12c|intercession]] for the transgressors. ^verse-12
