*Alma believes and writes the words of Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death by fire—He prophesies disease and death by fire upon his murderers. About 148 B.C.*

**1**    And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these sayings, that the king commanded that the [[#^note-1a|priests]] should take him and cause that he should be put to [[#^note-1b|death]]. ^verse-1

**2**    But there was one among them whose name was [[#^note-2a|Alma]], he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he [[#^note-2b|believed]] the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace. ^verse-2

**3**  But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that they might slay him. ^verse-3

**4**  But he fled from before them and [[#^note-4a|hid]] himself that they found him not. And he being concealed for many days did [[#^note-4b|write]] all the words which Abinadi had spoken. ^verse-4

**5**  And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison. ^verse-5

**6**  And after three days, having counseled with his [[#^note-6a|priests]], he caused that he should again be brought before him. ^verse-6

**7**  And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death. ^verse-7

**8**  For thou hast said that [[#^note-8a|God]] himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people. ^verse-8

**9**  Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will [[#^note-9a|not]] recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands. ^verse-9

**10**  Yea, and I will [[#^note-10a|suffer]] even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a [[#^note-10b|testimony]] against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed [[#^note-10c|innocent]] blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day. ^verse-10

**11**  And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him. ^verse-11

**12**  But the [[#^note-12a|priests]] lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in [[#^note-12b|anger]] against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain. ^verse-12

**13**  And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and [[#^note-13a|scourged]] his skin with faggots, yea, even unto [[#^note-13b|death]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying: ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy [[#^note-15a|seed]] shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of [[#^note-15b|death]] by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God. ^verse-15

**16**  And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of [[#^note-16a|diseases]] because of your iniquities. ^verse-16

**17**  Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts. ^verse-17

**18**  And in that day ye shall be [[#^note-18a|hunted]], and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of [[#^note-18b|death]] by fire. ^verse-18

**19**  Thus God executeth [[#^note-19a|vengeance]] upon those that destroy his people. O God, [[#^note-19b|receive]] my soul. ^verse-19

**20**  And now, when [[#^note-20a|Abinadi]] had said these words, he fell, having suffered [[#^note-20b|death]] by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death. ^verse-20
