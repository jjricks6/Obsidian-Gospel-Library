*Alma desires to cry repentance with angelic zeal—The Lord grants teachers for all nations—Alma glories in the Lord's work and in the success of Ammon and his brethren. About 76 B.C.*

**1**  O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the [[#^note-1a|trump]] of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people! ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and [[#^note-2a|come]] unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth. ^verse-2

**3**  But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. ^verse-3

**4**  I ought not to harrow up in my [[#^note-4a|desire]]s the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their [[#^note-4b|wills]], whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. ^verse-4

**5**  Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is [[#^note-5a|blameless]]; but he that [[#^note-5b|knoweth]] good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of [[#^note-5c|conscience]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to [[#^note-6a|perform]] the work to which I have been called? ^verse-6

**7**  Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth? ^verse-7

**8**  For behold, the Lord doth [[#^note-8a|grant]] unto [[#^note-8b|all]] nations, of their own nation and [[#^note-8c|tongue]], to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he [[#^note-8d|seeth]] fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true. ^verse-8

**9**  I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do [[#^note-9a|not]] [[#^note-9b|glory]] of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy. ^verse-9

**10**  And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember [[#^note-10a|what]] the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the [[#^note-11a|Lord]] did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who [[#^note-12a|delivered]] them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them out of [[#^note-12b|bondage]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a [[#^note-13a|holy]] calling, to [[#^note-13b|preach]] the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full. ^verse-13

**14**  But I do not joy in my own [[#^note-14a|success]] alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward! ^verse-15

**16**  Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my [[#^note-16a|joy]]. ^verse-16

**17**  And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen. ^verse-17
