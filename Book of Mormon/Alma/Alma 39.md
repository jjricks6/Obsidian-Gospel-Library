*The commandments of Alma to his son Corianton.*

### Chapter 39

[[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 38|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 40|Next Entry]]

*Sexual sin is an abomination—Corianton's sins kept the Zoramites from receiving the word—Christ's redemption is retroactive in saving the faithful who preceded it. About 74 B.C.*

**1**    And now, my [[#^note-1a|son]], I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set a good [[#^note-1b|example]] for thee? ^verse-1

**2**    For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the [[#^note-2a|Zoramites]]. Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom. ^verse-2

**3**  And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the [[#^note-3a|harlot]] Isabel. ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, she did [[#^note-4a|steal]] away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted. ^verse-4

**5**  Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most [[#^note-5a|abominable]] above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent [[#^note-5b|blood]] or denying the Holy Ghost? ^verse-5

**6**  For behold, if ye [[#^note-6a|deny]] the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is [[#^note-6b|unpardonable]]; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain [[#^note-6c|forgiveness]]; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness. ^verse-6

**7**  And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been [[#^note-7a|guilty]] of so great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good. ^verse-7

**8**  But behold, ye cannot [[#^note-8a|hide]] your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day. ^verse-8

**9**  Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the [[#^note-9a|lusts]] of your eyes, but [[#^note-9b|cross]] yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and [[#^note-9c|cross]] yourself in these things. ^verse-9

**10**  And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel. ^verse-10

**11**  Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son, how great [[#^note-11a|iniquity]] ye brought upon the [[#^note-11b|Zoramites]]; for when they saw your [[#^note-11c|conduct]] they would not believe in my words. ^verse-11

**12**  And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: [[#^note-12a|Command]] thy children to do good, lest they [[#^note-12b|lead]] away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye [[#^note-12c|refrain]] from your iniquities; ^verse-12

**13**  That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and [[#^note-13a|acknowledge]] your faults and that wrong which ye have done. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|Seek not]] after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you. ^verse-14

**15**  And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the [[#^note-15a|coming]] of Christ. Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people. ^verse-15

**16**  And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their [[#^note-16a|children]] to hear the word at the time of his coming. ^verse-16

**17**  And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand. Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming? ^verse-17

**18**  Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be [[#^note-18a|made]] known unto this people as well as unto their children? ^verse-18

**19**  Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to [[#^note-19a|send]] his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming? ^verse-19
