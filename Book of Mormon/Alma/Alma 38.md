*The commandments of Alma to his son Shiblon.*

### Chapter 38

[[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 37|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 39|Next Entry]]

*Shiblon was persecuted for righteousness' sake—Salvation is in Christ, who is the life and the light of the world—Bridle all your passions. About 74 B.C.*

**1**    My [[#^note-1a|son]], give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that [[#^note-1b|inasmuch]] as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be [[#^note-1c|cut off]] from his [[#^note-1d|presence]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your [[#^note-2a|steadiness]] and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that [[#^note-2b|endureth]] to the end. ^verse-2

**3**  I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the [[#^note-3a|Zoramites]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with [[#^note-4a|patience]] because the Lord was [[#^note-4b|with thee]]; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee. ^verse-4

**5**  And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your [[#^note-5a|trust]] in God even so much ye shall be [[#^note-5b|delivered]] out of your trials, and your [[#^note-5c|troubles]], and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day. ^verse-5

**6**  Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been [[#^note-6a|born of God]] I should not have known these things. ^verse-6

**7**  But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his [[#^note-7a|angel]] to declare unto me that I must stop the work of [[#^note-7b|destruction]] among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass that I was [[#^note-8a|three]] days and three nights in the most bitter [[#^note-8b|pain]] and [[#^note-8c|anguish]] of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a [[#^note-8d|remission]] of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul. ^verse-8

**9**  And [[#^note-9a|no]]w, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the [[#^note-9b|light]] of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and [[#^note-9c|righteousness]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and [[#^note-10a|temperate]] in all things. ^verse-10

**11**  See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not [[#^note-11a|boast]] in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength. ^verse-11

**12**  Use [[#^note-12a|boldness]], but not overbearance; and also see that ye [[#^note-12b|bridle]] all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness. ^verse-12

**13**  Do not [[#^note-13a|pray]] as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom. ^verse-13

**14**  Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are [[#^note-14a|better]] than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my [[#^note-14b|unworthiness]], and remember my brethren in mercy—yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times. ^verse-14

**15**  And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be [[#^note-15a|sober]]. My son, farewell. ^verse-15
