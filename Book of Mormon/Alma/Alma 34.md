### Chapter 34

[[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 33|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Alma/Alma 35|Next Entry]]

*Amulek testifies that the word is in Christ unto salvation—Unless an atonement is made, all mankind must perish—The whole law of Moses points toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—The eternal plan of redemption is based on faith and repentance—Pray for temporal and spiritual blessings—This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God—Work out your salvation with fear before God. About 74 B.C.*

**1**  And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and [[#^note-1a|Amulek]] arose and began to teach them, saying: ^verse-1

**2**  My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that [[#^note-2a|these things]] were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us. ^verse-2

**3**    And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you [[#^note-3a|what]] ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience— ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to [[#^note-4a|plant]] the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness. ^verse-4

**5**  And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be [[#^note-5a|no]] Christ. ^verse-5

**6**  And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the [[#^note-6a|word]] is in Christ unto salvation. ^verse-6

**7**  My brother has called upon the words of [[#^note-7a|Zenos]], that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of [[#^note-7b|Zenock]]; and also he has appealed unto [[#^note-7c|Moses]], to prove that these things are true. ^verse-7

**8**  And now, behold, I will [[#^note-8a|testify]] unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the [[#^note-8b|transgressions]] of his people, and that he shall [[#^note-8c|atone]] for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it. ^verse-8

**9**  For it is expedient that an [[#^note-9a|atonement]] should be made; for according to the great [[#^note-9b|plan]] of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are [[#^note-9c|fallen]] and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made. ^verse-9

**10**  For it is expedient that there should be a great and last [[#^note-10a|sacrifice]]; yea, not a [[#^note-10b|sacrifice]] of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an [[#^note-10c|infinite]] and [[#^note-10d|eternal]] [[#^note-10e|sacrifice]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is [[#^note-11a|just]], take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay. ^verse-11

**12**  But the law requireth the [[#^note-12a|life]] of him who hath [[#^note-12b|murdered]]; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a [[#^note-13a|stop]] to the shedding of [[#^note-13b|blood]]; then shall the [[#^note-13c|law]] of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away. ^verse-13

**14**  And behold, this is the whole [[#^note-14a|meaning]] of the [[#^note-14b|law]], every whit [[#^note-14c|pointing]] to that great and last [[#^note-14d|sacrifice]]; and that great and last [[#^note-14e|sacrifice]] will be the Son of God, yea, [[#^note-14f|infinite]] and eternal. ^verse-14

**15**  And thus he shall bring [[#^note-15a|salvation]] to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance. ^verse-15

**16**  And thus [[#^note-16a|mercy]] can satisfy the demands of [[#^note-16b|justice]], and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of [[#^note-16c|justice]]; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal [[#^note-16d|plan]] of [[#^note-16e|redemption]]. ^verse-16

**17**    Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your [[#^note-17a|faith]] unto repentance, that ye begin to [[#^note-17b|call]] upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you; ^verse-17

**18**  Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is [[#^note-18a|mighty]] to save. ^verse-18

**19**  Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in [[#^note-19a|prayer]] unto him. ^verse-19

**20**  Cry unto him when ye are in your [[#^note-20a|fields]], yea, over all your flocks. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Cry]] unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening. ^verse-21

**22**  Yea, cry unto him against the power of your [[#^note-22a|enemies]]. ^verse-22

**23**  Yea, [[#^note-23a|cry]] unto him against the [[#^note-23b|devil]], who is an enemy to all [[#^note-23c|righteousness]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. ^verse-24

**25**  Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. ^verse-25

**26**  But this is not all; ye must [[#^note-26a|pour out]] your souls in your [[#^note-26b|closets]], and your secret places, and in your wilderness. ^verse-26

**27**  Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your [[#^note-27a|hearts]] be [[#^note-27b|full]], drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your [[#^note-27c|welfare]], and also for the welfare of [[#^note-27d|those]] who are around you. ^verse-27

**28**  And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye [[#^note-28a|turn away]] the [[#^note-28b|needy]], and the [[#^note-28c|naked]], and visit not the sick and afflicted, and [[#^note-28d|impart]] of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your [[#^note-28e|prayer]] is [[#^note-28f|vain]], and availeth you nothing, and ye are as [[#^note-28g|hypocrites]] who do deny the faith. ^verse-28

**29**  Therefore, if ye do not remember to be [[#^note-29a|charitable]], ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men. ^verse-29

**30**  And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have [[#^note-30a|received]] so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring [[#^note-30b|fruit]] unto repentance. ^verse-30

**31**  Yea, I would that ye would come forth and [[#^note-31a|harden]] not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the [[#^note-31b|day]] of your [[#^note-31c|salvation]]; and therefore, if ye will repent and [[#^note-31d|harden]] not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you. ^verse-31

**32**  For behold, this [[#^note-32a|life]] is the time for men to [[#^note-32b|prepare]] to meet God; yea, behold the day of [[#^note-32c|this]] life is the day for men to perform their [[#^note-32d|labors]]. ^verse-32

**33**  And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many [[#^note-33a|witnesses]], therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not [[#^note-33b|procrastinate]] the day of your [[#^note-33c|repentance]] until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the [[#^note-33d|night]] of [[#^note-33e|darkness]] wherein there can be no labor performed. ^verse-33

**34**  Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful [[#^note-34a|crisis]], that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth [[#^note-34b|possess]] your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world. ^verse-34

**35**  For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become [[#^note-35a|subjected]] to the spirit of the devil, and he doth [[#^note-35b|seal]] you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked. ^verse-35

**36**  And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in [[#^note-36a|unholy]] temples, but in the [[#^note-36b|hearts]] of the [[#^note-36c|righteous]] doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the [[#^note-36d|blood]] of the Lamb. ^verse-36

**37**  And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should [[#^note-37a|work]] out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ; ^verse-37

**38**  That ye [[#^note-38a|contend]] no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the [[#^note-38b|name]] of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and [[#^note-38c|worship]] God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in [[#^note-38d|thanksgiving]] daily, for the many [[#^note-38e|mercies]] and blessings which he doth bestow upon you. ^verse-38

**39**  Yea, and I also [[#^note-39a|exhort]] you, my brethren, that ye be [[#^note-39b|watchful]] unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the [[#^note-39c|temptations]] of the devil, that he may [[#^note-39d|no]]t overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing. ^verse-39

**40**  And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have [[#^note-40a|patience]], and that ye bear with all manner of [[#^note-40b|afflictions]]; that ye do not [[#^note-40c|revile]] against those who do cast you out because of your [[#^note-40d|exceeding]] poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them; ^verse-40

**41**  But that ye have [[#^note-41a|patience]], and bear with those [[#^note-41b|afflictions]], with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions. ^verse-41
