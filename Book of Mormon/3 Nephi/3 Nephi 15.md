[[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 14|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 16|Next Entry]]

*Jesus announces that the law of Moses is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are the other sheep of whom He spoke in Jerusalem—Because of iniquity, the Lord's people in Jerusalem do not know of the scattered sheep of Israel. About A.D. 34.*

**1**    And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I [[#^note-1a|taught]] before I ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and [[#^note-1b|doeth]] them, him will I [[#^note-1c|raise up]] at the last day. ^verse-1

**2**  And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he perceived that there were some among them who marveled, and wondered what he would concerning the law of Moses; for they understood not the saying that [[#^note-2a|old]] things had passed away, and that all things had become new. ^verse-2

**3**  And he said unto them: Marvel not that I said unto you that old things had passed away, and that all things had become [[#^note-3a|new]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I say unto you that the [[#^note-4a|law]] is fulfilled that was given unto Moses. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, [[#^note-5a|I]] am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is [[#^note-5b|fulfil]]led, for I have come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I do [[#^note-6a|not]] destroy the prophets, for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled. ^verse-6

**7**  And because I said unto you that old things have passed away, I do not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which are to come. ^verse-7

**8**  For behold, the [[#^note-8a|covenant]] which I have made with my people is not all fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses hath an end in me. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, I am the [[#^note-9a|law]], and the [[#^note-9b|light]]. Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall [[#^note-9c|live]]; for unto him that [[#^note-9d|endureth]] to the end will I give eternal life. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold, I have given unto you the [[#^note-10a|commandments]]; therefore keep my commandments. And this is the law and the prophets, for they truly [[#^note-10b|testified]] of me. ^verse-10

**11**  And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he [[#^note-11a|said]] unto those twelve whom he had chosen: ^verse-11

**12**    Ye are my [[#^note-12a|disciples]]; and ye are a [[#^note-12b|light]] unto this people, who are a remnant of the house of [[#^note-12c|Joseph]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And behold, this is the [[#^note-13a|land]] of your inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you. ^verse-13

**14**  And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should [[#^note-14a|tell]] it unto your brethren at Jerusalem. ^verse-14

**15**  Neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell unto them concerning the [[#^note-15a|other tribes]] of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land. ^verse-15

**16**  This much did the Father [[#^note-16a|command]] me, that I should tell unto them: ^verse-16

**17**  That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one [[#^note-17a|shepherd]]. ^verse-17

**18**  And now, because of [[#^note-18a|stiffneckedness]] and [[#^note-18b|unbelief]] they [[#^note-18c|understood]] not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the [[#^note-18d|Father]] concerning this thing unto them. ^verse-18

**19**  But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were [[#^note-19a|separated]] from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you. ^verse-19

**20**  And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath the Father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity that they know not of them. ^verse-20

**21**  And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: [[#^note-21a|Other]] sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one [[#^note-21b|shepherd]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the [[#^note-22a|Gentiles]]; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be [[#^note-22b|converted]] through their preaching. ^verse-22

**23**  And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the [[#^note-23a|Gentiles]] should not at any time hear my voice—that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the [[#^note-23b|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-23

**24**  But behold, ye have both heard [[#^note-24a|my voice]], and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among those whom the Father hath [[#^note-24b|given]] me. ^verse-24
