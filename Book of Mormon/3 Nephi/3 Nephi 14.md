### Chapter 14

[[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 13|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 15|Next Entry]]

*Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God; beware of false prophets—He promises salvation to those who do the will of the Father—Compare Matthew 7. About A.D. 34.*

**1**    [[#^note-1a|And]] now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|For]] with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. ^verse-2

**3**  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ^verse-3

**4**  Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thine own eye? ^verse-4

**5**  Thou [[#^note-5a|hypocrite]], first cast the [[#^note-5b|beam]] out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye. ^verse-5

**6**  Give not that which is [[#^note-6a|holy]] unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Ask]], and it shall be given unto you; [[#^note-7b|seek]], and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-7

**8**  For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. ^verse-8

**9**  Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone? ^verse-9

**10**  Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? ^verse-10

**11**  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should [[#^note-12a|do]] to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets. ^verse-12

**13**  Enter ye in at the [[#^note-13a|strait gate]]; for wide is the gate, and [[#^note-13b|broad]] is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat; ^verse-13

**14**  Because strait is the [[#^note-14a|gate]], and [[#^note-14b|narrow]] is the way, which leadeth unto life, and [[#^note-14c|few]] there be that find it. ^verse-14

**15**  Beware of [[#^note-15a|false prophets]], who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. ^verse-15

**16**  Ye shall know them by their [[#^note-16a|fruits]]. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? ^verse-16

**17**  Even so every [[#^note-17a|good]] tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. ^verse-17

**18**  A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ^verse-18

**19**  Every tree that [[#^note-19a|bringeth]] not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore, by their [[#^note-20a|fruits]] ye shall know them. ^verse-20

**21**  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall [[#^note-21a|enter]] into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven. ^verse-21

**22**  Many will [[#^note-22a|say]] to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? ^verse-22

**23**  And then will [[#^note-23a|I]] profess unto them: I never [[#^note-23b|knew]] you; [[#^note-23c|depart]] from me, ye that work iniquity. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a [[#^note-24a|rock]]— ^verse-24

**25**  And the [[#^note-25a|rain]] descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it [[#^note-25b|fell]] not, for it was founded upon a rock. ^verse-25

**26**  And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a [[#^note-26a|foolish]] man, who built his house upon the [[#^note-26b|sand]]— ^verse-26

**27**  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it. ^verse-27
