*There is silence in the land for many hours—The voice of Christ promises to gather His people as a hen gathers her chickens—The more righteous part of the people have been preserved. About A.D. 34-35.*

**1**  And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did [[#^note-1a|hear]] these sayings, and did witness of it. And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours; ^verse-1

**2**  For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours. ^verse-2

**3**  And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying: ^verse-3

**4**  O ye people of these [[#^note-4a|great]] cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I [[#^note-4b|gathered]] you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have [[#^note-4c|nourished]] you. ^verse-4

**5**  And again, [[#^note-5a|how]] oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not. ^verse-5

**6**  O ye house of Israel whom I have [[#^note-6a|spared]], how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and [[#^note-6b|return]] unto me with full purpose of [[#^note-6c|heart]]. ^verse-6

**7**  But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become [[#^note-7a|desolate]] until the time of the fulfilling of the [[#^note-7b|covenant]] to your fathers. ^verse-7

**8**  And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl [[#^note-8a|again]] because of the loss of their kindred and friends. ^verse-8

**9**    And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the [[#^note-9a|darkness]] dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the [[#^note-9b|rocks]] did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away. ^verse-9

**10**  And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the [[#^note-10a|mourning]], and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the [[#^note-10b|praise]] and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer. ^verse-10

**11**  And thus far were the [[#^note-11a|scriptures]] [[#^note-11b|fulfilled]] which had been spoken by the prophets. ^verse-11

**12**  And it was the [[#^note-12a|more]] righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared— ^verse-12

**13**  And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness. ^verse-13

**14**  And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him [[#^note-14a|search]] them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by [[#^note-14b|tempests]], and by whirlwinds, and by the [[#^note-14c|opening]] of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were [[#^note-15a|slain]] because they testified of these things. ^verse-15

**16**  Yea, the prophet [[#^note-16a|Zenos]] did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake [[#^note-16b|concerning]] these things, because they testified particularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a [[#^note-17a|remnant]] of the seed of Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem? ^verse-17

**18**  And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of Nephi who were spared, and also those who had been called [[#^note-18a|Lamanites]], who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto them, and great [[#^note-18b|blessings]] poured out upon their heads, insomuch that soon after the [[#^note-18c|ascension]] of Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them— ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Showing]] his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore for this time I make an end of my sayings. ^verse-19
