*In the last days, Zion and her stakes will be established, and Israel will be gathered in mercy and tenderness—They will triumph—Compare Isaiah 54. About A.D. 34.*

**1**  And then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O [[#^note-1a|barren]], thou that didst not bear; break forth into [[#^note-1b|singing]], and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the [[#^note-1c|desolate]] than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord. ^verse-1

**2**  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy [[#^note-2a|stakes]]; ^verse-2

**3**  For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall [[#^note-3a|inherit]] the [[#^note-3b|Gentiles]] and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. ^verse-3

**4**  Fear not, for thou shalt not be a[[#^note-4a|shame]]d; neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to [[#^note-4b|shame]]; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the [[#^note-4c|reproach]] of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. ^verse-4

**5**  For thy maker, thy [[#^note-5a|husband]], the Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel—the God of the whole earth shall he be called. ^verse-5

**6**  For the Lord hath called thee [[#^note-6a|as]] a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. ^verse-6

**7**  For a small moment have I [[#^note-7a|forsaken]] thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. ^verse-7

**8**  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting [[#^note-8a|kindness]] will I have [[#^note-8b|mercy]] on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. ^verse-8

**9**  For [[#^note-9a|this]], the [[#^note-9b|waters of Noah]] unto me, for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee. ^verse-9

**10**  For the [[#^note-10a|mountains]] shall depart and the hills be removed, but my [[#^note-10b|kindness]] shall not [[#^note-10c|depart]] from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. ^verse-10

**11**  O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold, I will lay thy [[#^note-11a|stones]] with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. ^verse-12

**13**  And [[#^note-13a|all]] thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the [[#^note-13b|peace]] of thy children. ^verse-13

**14**  In [[#^note-14a|righteousness]] shalt thou be established; thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear, and from terror for it shall not come near thee. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, they shall surely gather together [[#^note-15a|against]] thee, not by me; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. ^verse-16

**17**  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the [[#^note-17a|servants]] of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. ^verse-17
