*The latter-day Gentiles are commanded to repent, come unto Christ, and be numbered with the house of Israel. About A.D. 34-35.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, which he hath [[#^note-1a|commanded]] me that I should speak concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should write, saying: ^verse-1

**2**  Turn, all ye [[#^note-2a|Gentiles]], from your wicked ways; and [[#^note-2b|repent]] of your evil doings, of your [[#^note-2c|lyings]] and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your [[#^note-2d|murders]], and your [[#^note-2e|priestcrafts]], and your [[#^note-2f|envyings]], and your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be [[#^note-2g|numbered]] with my people who are of the house of Israel. ^verse-2
