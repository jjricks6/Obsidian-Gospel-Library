*Israel will be gathered when the Book of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles will be established as a free people in America—They will be saved if they believe and obey; otherwise, they will be cut off and destroyed—Israel will build the New Jerusalem, and the lost tribes will return. About A.D. 34.*

**1**  And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a [[#^note-1a|sign]], that ye may know the [[#^note-1b|time]] when these things shall be about to take place—that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them my Zion; ^verse-1

**2**  And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign—for verily I say unto you that [[#^note-2a|when]] these things which I declare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be scattered by them; ^verse-2

**3**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these things shall be made [[#^note-3a|known]] unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father, [[#^note-3b|from them]] unto you; ^verse-3

**4**  For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a [[#^note-4a|free]] people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the [[#^note-4b|covenant]] of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel; ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be wrought among you hereafter shall come forth [[#^note-5a|from]] the Gentiles, unto your [[#^note-5b|seed]] which shall dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity; ^verse-5

**6**  For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the [[#^note-6a|Gentiles]], that he may show forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and know of the true points of my doctrine, that they may be [[#^note-6b|numbered]] among my people, O house of Israel; ^verse-6

**7**  And when these things come to pass that thy [[#^note-7a|seed]] shall begin to know these things—it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who are of the house of Israel. ^verse-7

**8**  And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they [[#^note-8a|consider]]. ^verse-8

**9**  For in that day, for my sake shall the Father [[#^note-9a|work]] a work, which shall be a great and a [[#^note-9b|marvelous]] [[#^note-9c|work]] among them; and there shall be among them those who will not believe it, although a man shall declare it unto them. ^verse-9

**10**  But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they shall not hurt him, although he shall be [[#^note-10a|marred]] because of them. Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that [[#^note-10b|my]] wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause [[#^note-11a|him]] to bring forth unto the [[#^note-11b|Gentiles]], and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be [[#^note-11c|cut off]] from among my people who are of the covenant. ^verse-11

**12**  And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a [[#^note-12a|lion]] among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. ^verse-12

**13**  Their hand shall be lifted up upon their [[#^note-13a|adversaries]], and all their enemies shall be cut off. ^verse-13

**14**  Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they [[#^note-14a|repent]]; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy [[#^note-14b|chariots]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy [[#^note-15a|strongholds]]; ^verse-15

**16**  And I will cut off [[#^note-16a|witchcrafts]] out of thy land, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers; ^verse-16

**17**  Thy [[#^note-17a|graven images]] I will also cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hands; ^verse-17

**18**  And I will pluck up thy [[#^note-18a|groves]] out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities. ^verse-18

**19**  And it shall come to pass that all [[#^note-19a|lyings]], and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away. ^verse-19

**20**  For it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that at that [[#^note-20a|day]] whosoever will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will I [[#^note-20b|cut off]] from among my people, O house of Israel; ^verse-20

**21**  And I will execute [[#^note-21a|vengeance]] and [[#^note-21b|fury]] upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. ^verse-21

**22**  But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and [[#^note-22a|harden]] not their hearts, I will [[#^note-22b|establish]] my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant and be [[#^note-22c|numbered]] among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their [[#^note-22d|inheritance]]; ^verse-22

**23**  And they shall assist my [[#^note-23a|people]], the remnant of Jacob, and also as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be called the [[#^note-23b|New Jerusalem]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And then shall [[#^note-24a|they]] assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem. ^verse-24

**25**  And then shall the [[#^note-25a|power]] of heaven come down among them; and [[#^note-25b|I]] also will be in the midst. ^verse-25

**26**  And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even [[#^note-26a|when]] this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of [[#^note-26b|this people]]. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been [[#^note-26c|lost]], which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem. ^verse-26

**27**  Yea, the work shall commence among all the [[#^note-27a|dispersed]] of my people, with the Father to prepare the way whereby they may [[#^note-27b|come]] unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name. ^verse-27

**28**  Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be [[#^note-28a|gathered]] home to the land of their inheritance. ^verse-28

**29**  And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall [[#^note-29a|not go]] out in [[#^note-29b|haste]], nor go by flight, for I will go before them, saith the Father, and I will be their rearward. ^verse-29
