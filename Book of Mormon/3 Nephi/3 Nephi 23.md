### Chapter 23

[[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 22|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 24|Next Entry]]

*Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—He commands the people to search the prophets—The words of Samuel the Lamanite concerning the Resurrection are added to their records. About A.D. 34.*

**1**  And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought to [[#^note-1a|search]] these things. Yea, a commandment I give unto you that ye search these things diligently; for great are the words of [[#^note-1b|Isaiah]]. ^verse-1

**2**  For surely he spake as touching all things concerning my people which are of the house of Israel; [[#^note-2a|therefore]] it must needs be that he must speak also to the Gentiles. ^verse-2

**3**  And all things that he spake have been and [[#^note-3a|shall]] be, even according to the words which he spake. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore give heed to my words; write the things which I have told you; and according to the time and the will of the Father [[#^note-4a|they]] shall go forth unto the Gentiles. ^verse-4

**5**  And whosoever will hearken unto my words and repenteth and is baptized, the same shall be saved. Search the [[#^note-5a|prophets]], for many there be that testify of these things. ^verse-5

**6**  And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he said unto them again, after he had expounded all the scriptures unto them which they had received, he said unto them: Behold, other scriptures I would that ye should write, that ye have not. ^verse-6

**7**  And it came to pass that he said unto [[#^note-7a|Nephi]]: Bring forth the record which ye have kept. ^verse-7

**8**  And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them before him, he cast his eyes upon them and said: ^verse-8

**9**  Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant [[#^note-9a|Samuel]], the Lamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should glorify his name in me that there were [[#^note-9b|many]] [[#^note-9c|saints]] who should [[#^note-9d|arise]] from the dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he said unto them: Was it not so? ^verse-9

**10**  And his disciples answered him and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words, and they were all fulfilled. ^verse-10

**11**  And Jesus said unto them: How be it that ye have not [[#^note-11a|written]] this thing, that many [[#^note-11b|saints]] did arise and appear unto many and did minister unto them? ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had not been written. ^verse-12

**13**  And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be [[#^note-13a|written]]; therefore it was written according as he commanded. ^verse-13

**14**  And now it came to pass that when Jesus had [[#^note-14a|expounded]] all the scriptures in one, which they had written, he commanded them that they should [[#^note-14b|teach]] the things which he had expounded unto them. ^verse-14
