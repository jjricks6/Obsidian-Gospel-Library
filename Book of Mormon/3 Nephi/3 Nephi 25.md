[[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 24|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 26|Next Entry]]

*At the Second Coming, the proud and wicked will be burned as stubble—Elijah will return before that great and dreadful day—Compare Malachi 4. About A.D. 34.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|For]] behold, the day cometh that shall [[#^note-1b|burn]] as an oven; and all the [[#^note-1c|proud]], yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. ^verse-1

**2**  But unto you that fear my name, shall the [[#^note-2a|Son of Righteousness]] arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and [[#^note-2b|grow up]] as [[#^note-2c|calves]] in the stall. ^verse-2

**3**  And ye shall [[#^note-3a|tread]] down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-3

**4**  Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him in [[#^note-4a|Horeb]] for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I will send you [[#^note-5a|Elijah]] the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful [[#^note-5b|day]] of the Lord; ^verse-5

**6**  And he shall [[#^note-6a|turn]] the heart of the [[#^note-6b|fathers]] to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and [[#^note-6c|smite]] the earth with a curse. ^verse-6
