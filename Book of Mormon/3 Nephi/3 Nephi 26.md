### Chapter 26

[[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 25|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/3 Nephi/3 Nephi 27|Next Entry]]

*Jesus expounds all things from the beginning to the end—Babes and children utter marvelous things that cannot be written—Those in the Church of Christ have all things in common among them. About A.D. 34.*

**1**  And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things he expounded them unto the multitude; and he did expound all things unto them, both great and small. ^verse-1

**2**  And he saith: [[#^note-2a|These scriptures]], which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations. ^verse-2

**3**  And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the [[#^note-3a|time]] that he should come in his [[#^note-3b|glory]]—yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the [[#^note-3c|elements]] should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be [[#^note-3d|wrapt]] together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away; ^verse-3

**4**  And even unto the [[#^note-4a|great]] and last day, when all people, and all kindreds, and all nations and tongues shall [[#^note-4b|stand]] before God, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil— ^verse-4

**5**  If they be good, to the [[#^note-5a|resurrection]] of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the [[#^note-5b|justice]], and the holiness which is in Christ, who was [[#^note-5c|before]] the world began. ^verse-5

**6**  And now there cannot be written in this book even a [[#^note-6a|hundredth]] part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people; ^verse-6

**7**  But behold the [[#^note-7a|plates of Nephi]] do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people. ^verse-7

**8**  And these things have I written, which are a [[#^note-8a|lesser]] part of the things which he taught the people; and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, [[#^note-8b|from]] the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken. ^verse-8

**9**  And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the [[#^note-9a|greater things]] be made manifest unto them. ^verse-9

**10**  And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the [[#^note-10a|greater things]] be [[#^note-10b|withheld]] from them, unto their condemnation. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord [[#^note-11a|forbade]] it, saying: I will [[#^note-11b|try]] the faith of my people. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore I, [[#^note-12a|Mormon]], do write the things which have been commanded me of the Lord. And now I, [[#^note-12b|Mormon]], make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have been commanded me. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that he did [[#^note-13a|show]] himself unto them oft, and did break [[#^note-13b|bread]] oft, and bless it, and give it unto them. ^verse-13

**14**  And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the [[#^note-14a|children]] of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did [[#^note-14b|loose]] their [[#^note-14c|tongues]], and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people; and he loosed their tongues that they could utter. ^verse-14

**15**  And it came to pass that after he had ascended into heaven—the second time that he showed himself unto them, and had gone unto the Father, after having [[#^note-15a|healed]] all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind and unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among them, and raised a man from the [[#^note-15b|dead]], and had shown forth his power unto them, and had ascended unto the Father— ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even [[#^note-16a|babes]] did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were [[#^note-16b|forbidden]] that there should not any man write them. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass that the [[#^note-17a|disciples]] whom Jesus had chosen began [[#^note-17b|from]] that time forth to [[#^note-17c|baptize]] and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus were filled with the Holy Ghost. ^verse-17

**18**  And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are [[#^note-18a|not lawful]] to be written. ^verse-18

**19**  And they taught, and did [[#^note-19a|minister]] one to another; and they had [[#^note-19b|all]] things [[#^note-19c|common]] among them, every man dealing justly, one with another. ^verse-19

**20**  And it came to pass that they did do all things even as Jesus had commanded them. ^verse-20

**21**  And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the [[#^note-21a|church]] of Christ. ^verse-21
