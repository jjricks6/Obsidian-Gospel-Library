*Nephi makes two sets of records—Each is called the plates of Nephi—The larger plates contain a secular history; the smaller ones deal primarily with sacred things. About 600-592 B.C.*

**1**  And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the [[#^note-1a|valley of Lemuel]], and also a great many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates. ^verse-1

**2**  And now, as I have spoken concerning these [[#^note-2a|plates]], behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi. ^verse-2

**3**  Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special [[#^note-3a|purpose]] that there should be an account engraven of the [[#^note-3b|ministry]] of my people. ^verse-3

**4**  Upon the [[#^note-4a|other plates]] should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people; wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a [[#^note-5a|wise]] purpose in him, which purpose I know not. ^verse-5

**6**  But the Lord [[#^note-6a|knoweth]] all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all [[#^note-6b|power]] unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen. ^verse-6
