[[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 20|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 22|Next Entry]]

*The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles and will free the prisoners—Israel will be gathered with power in the last days—Kings will be their nursing fathers—Compare Isaiah 49. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O [[#^note-1b|isles]], unto me, and hearken ye people from [[#^note-1c|far]]; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. ^verse-1

**2**  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; ^verse-2

**3**  And said unto me: Thou art my [[#^note-3a|servant]], O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. ^verse-3

**4**  Then I said, I have labored in [[#^note-4a|vain]], I have spent my strength for naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God. ^verse-4

**5**  And now, saith the Lord—that [[#^note-5a|formed]] me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him—though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my [[#^note-5b|strength]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the [[#^note-6a|tribes]] of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a [[#^note-6b|light]] to the [[#^note-6c|Gentiles]], that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful. ^verse-7

**8**  Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O isles of the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee [[#^note-8a|my servant]] for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; ^verse-8

**9**  That thou mayest say to the [[#^note-9a|prisoners]]: Go forth; to them that sit in [[#^note-9b|darkness]]: Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their [[#^note-9c|pastures]] shall be in all high places. ^verse-9

**10**  They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will make all my mountains a way, and my [[#^note-11a|highways]] shall be exalted. ^verse-11

**12**  And then, O house of Israel, behold, [[#^note-12a|these]] shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Sing]], O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and [[#^note-13b|break forth]] into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his [[#^note-13c|afflicted]]. ^verse-13

**14**  But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me—but he will show that he hath not. ^verse-14

**15**  For can a [[#^note-15a|woman]] forget her sucking child, that she should not have [[#^note-15b|compassion]] on the son of her womb? Yea, they may [[#^note-15c|forget]], yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, I have graven thee upon the [[#^note-16a|palms]] of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. ^verse-16

**17**  Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and they that made thee [[#^note-17a|waste]] shall go forth of thee. ^verse-17

**18**  Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all these [[#^note-18a|gather]] themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride. ^verse-18

**19**  For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. ^verse-19

**20**  The children whom thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the first, shall [[#^note-20a|again]] in thine ears say: The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell. ^verse-20

**21**  Then shalt thou say in thine heart: Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am [[#^note-21a|desolate]], a captive, and removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been? ^verse-21

**22**  Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the [[#^note-22a|Gentiles]], and set up my [[#^note-22b|standard]] to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their [[#^note-22c|arms]], and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. ^verse-22

**23**  And [[#^note-23a|kings]] shall be thy [[#^note-23b|nursing fathers]], and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that [[#^note-23c|wait]] for me. ^verse-23

**24**  For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the [[#^note-24a|lawful captives]] delivered? ^verse-24

**25**  But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. ^verse-25

**26**  And I will [[#^note-26a|feed]] them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall [[#^note-26b|know]] that I, the Lord, am thy [[#^note-26c|Savior]] and thy Redeemer, the [[#^note-26d|Mighty One]] of Jacob. ^verse-26
