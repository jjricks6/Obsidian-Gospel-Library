[[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 21|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi|Next Entry]]

*Israel will be scattered upon all the face of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse and nourish Israel with the gospel in the last days—Israel will be gathered and saved, and the wicked will burn as stubble—The kingdom of the devil will be destroyed, and Satan will be bound. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**  And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the [[#^note-1a|plates of brass]], my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What [[#^note-1b|meaneth]] these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are [[#^note-1c|spiritual]], which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh? ^verse-1

**2**  And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were [[#^note-2a|manifest]] unto the prophet by the voice of the [[#^note-2b|Spirit]]; for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the [[#^note-2c|prophets]], which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both [[#^note-3a|temporal]] and spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be [[#^note-3b|scattered]] upon all the face of the earth, and also [[#^note-3c|among]] all nations. ^verse-3

**4**  And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the [[#^note-4a|tribes]] have been [[#^note-4b|led away]]; and they are [[#^note-4c|scattered]] to and fro upon the [[#^note-4d|isles]] of the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away. ^verse-4

**5**  And since they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel; for against him will they [[#^note-5a|harden]] their hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be [[#^note-5b|hated]] of all men. ^verse-5

**6**  Nevertheless, after they shall be [[#^note-6a|nursed]] by the [[#^note-6b|Gentiles]], and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and their [[#^note-6c|children]] have been carried in their arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders, behold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the house of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the [[#^note-7a|Gentiles]], yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be [[#^note-7b|scattered]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a [[#^note-8a|marvelous work]] among the [[#^note-8b|Gentiles]], which shall be of great [[#^note-8c|worth]] unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the [[#^note-8d|Gentiles]] and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders. ^verse-8

**9**  And it shall also be of [[#^note-9a|worth]] [[#^note-9b|unto]] the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the [[#^note-9c|house of Israel]], unto the making known of the [[#^note-9d|covenants]] of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy [[#^note-9e|seed]] shall all the kindreds of the earth be [[#^note-9f|blessed]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make [[#^note-10a|bare]] his arm in the eyes of the nations. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the [[#^note-11a|nations]], in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, he will [[#^note-12a|bring]] them again out of [[#^note-12b|captivity]], and they shall be [[#^note-12c|gathered]] together to the lands of their [[#^note-12d|inheritance]]; and they shall be [[#^note-12e|brought]] out of obscurity and out of [[#^note-12f|darkness]]; and they shall know that the [[#^note-12g|Lord]] is their [[#^note-12h|Savior]] and their Redeemer, the [[#^note-12i|Mighty One]] of Israel. ^verse-12

**13**  And the blood of that great and [[#^note-13a|abominable]] church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall [[#^note-13b|war]] among themselves, and the sword of their [[#^note-13c|own]] hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood. ^verse-13

**14**  And every [[#^note-14a|nation]] which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall [[#^note-14b|fall]] into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that [[#^note-14c|fight]] against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the [[#^note-14d|dust]] and great shall be the fall of it. ^verse-14

**15**  For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do wickedly shall be as [[#^note-15a|stubble]]; and the day cometh that they must be [[#^note-15b|burned]]. ^verse-15

**16**  For the time soon cometh that the fulness of the [[#^note-16a|wrath]] of God shall be poured out upon all the children of men; for he will not suffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore, he will [[#^note-17a|preserve]] the [[#^note-17b|righteous]] by his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for thus saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel. ^verse-18

**19**  For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come that all they who fight against Zion shall be cut off. ^verse-19

**20**  And the Lord will surely [[#^note-20a|prepare]] a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A [[#^note-20b|prophet]] shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be [[#^note-20c|cut off]] from among the people. ^verse-20

**21**  And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this [[#^note-21a|prophet]] of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute [[#^note-21b|judgment]] in righteousness. ^verse-21

**22**  And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh— ^verse-22

**23**  For the time speedily shall come that all [[#^note-23a|churches]] which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up to become [[#^note-23b|popular]] in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the [[#^note-23c|devil]] are they who need fear, and tremble, and [[#^note-23d|quake]]; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be [[#^note-23e|consumed]] as stubble; and this is according to the words of the prophet. ^verse-23

**24**  And the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led up as [[#^note-24a|calves]] of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great [[#^note-24b|glory]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And he [[#^note-25a|gathereth]] his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his [[#^note-25b|sheep]], and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find [[#^note-25c|pasture]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And because of the [[#^note-26a|righteousness]] of his people, [[#^note-26b|Satan]] has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of [[#^note-26c|many years]]; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel [[#^note-26d|reigneth]]. ^verse-26

**27**  And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all these [[#^note-27a|things]] must come according to the flesh. ^verse-27

**28**  But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people shall dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel if it so be that they will [[#^note-28a|repent]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things. ^verse-29

**30**  Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the things which have been written upon the [[#^note-30a|plates of brass]] are true; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God. ^verse-30

**31**  Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the [[#^note-31a|commandments]], and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen. ^verse-31
