[[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 19|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 21|Next Entry]]

*The Lord reveals His purposes to Israel—Israel has been chosen in the furnace of affliction and is to go forth from Babylon—Compare Isaiah 48. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Hearken]] and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or out of the waters of [[#^note-1b|baptism]], who [[#^note-1c|swear]] by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear [[#^note-1d|not]] in truth nor in righteousness. ^verse-1

**2**  Nevertheless, they call themselves of the [[#^note-2a|holy city]], but they do [[#^note-2b|not]] stay themselves upon the God of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts; yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I have declared the [[#^note-3a|former]] things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them. I did show them suddenly. ^verse-3

**4**  And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy [[#^note-4a|neck]] is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; ^verse-4

**5**  And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it came to pass I [[#^note-5a|showed]] them thee; and I showed them for fear lest thou shouldst say—Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image hath commanded them. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye [[#^note-6a|not declare]] them? And that I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. ^verse-6

**7**  They are created now, and not from the beginning, even before the day when thou heardest them not they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst say—Behold I knew them. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a [[#^note-8a|transgressor]] from the womb. ^verse-8

**9**  Nevertheless, for my [[#^note-9a|name's]] sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off. ^verse-9

**10**  For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in the furnace of [[#^note-10a|affliction]]. ^verse-10

**11**  For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do this, for I will not suffer my [[#^note-11a|name]] to be polluted, and I will [[#^note-11b|not give]] my glory unto another. ^verse-11

**12**  Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called, for I am he; I am the [[#^note-12a|first]], and I am also the last. ^verse-12

**13**  Mine hand hath also [[#^note-13a|laid]] the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens. I [[#^note-13b|call]] unto them and they stand up together. ^verse-13

**14**  All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him; yea, and he will [[#^note-14a|fulfil]] his word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on [[#^note-14b|Babylon]], and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans. ^verse-14

**15**  Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called [[#^note-15a|him]] to declare, I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. ^verse-15

**16**  Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in [[#^note-16a|secret]]; from the beginning, from the time that it was declared have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his [[#^note-16b|Spirit]], hath sent me. ^verse-16

**17**  And thus saith the Lord, thy [[#^note-17a|Redeemer]], the Holy One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who [[#^note-17b|leadeth]] thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it. ^verse-17

**18**  O that thou hadst hearkened to my [[#^note-18a|commandments]]—then had thy [[#^note-18b|peace]] been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea. ^verse-18

**19**  Thy [[#^note-19a|seed]] also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Go]] ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the [[#^note-20b|Chaldeans]], with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye: The Lord hath redeemed his [[#^note-20c|servant]] Jacob. ^verse-20

**21**  And they [[#^note-21a|thirsted]] not; he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the [[#^note-21b|rock]] for them; he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out. ^verse-21

**22**  And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, there is no [[#^note-22a|peace]], saith the Lord, unto the wicked. ^verse-22
