### Chapter 8

[[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 9|Next Entry]]

*Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life—He partakes of its fruit and desires his family to do likewise—He sees a rod of iron, a strait and narrow path, and the mists of darkness that enshroud men—Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse. About 600-592 B.C.*

**1**  And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of [[#^note-1a|seeds]] of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of the seeds of fruit of every kind. ^verse-1

**2**    And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have [[#^note-2a|dreamed]] a dream; or, in other words, I have [[#^note-2b|seen]] a [[#^note-2c|vision]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of [[#^note-3a|Nephi]] and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved. ^verse-3

**4**  But behold, [[#^note-4a|Laman]] and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness. ^verse-4

**5**  And it came to pass that I saw a [[#^note-5a|man]], and he was dressed in a white [[#^note-5b|robe]]; and he came and stood before me. ^verse-5

**6**  And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him. ^verse-6

**7**  And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste. ^verse-7

**8**  And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have [[#^note-8a|mercy]] on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies. ^verse-8

**9**  And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious [[#^note-9a|field]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And it came to pass that I beheld a [[#^note-10a|tree]], whose [[#^note-10b|fruit]] was desirable to make one [[#^note-10c|happy]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the [[#^note-11a|fruit]] thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the [[#^note-11b|whiteness]] that I had ever seen. ^verse-11

**12**    And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great [[#^note-12a|joy]]; wherefore, I began to be [[#^note-12b|desirous]] that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was [[#^note-12c|desirable]] above all other fruit. ^verse-12

**13**  And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a [[#^note-13a|river]] of water; and it ran along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit. ^verse-13

**14**  And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam, and [[#^note-14a|Nephi]]; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go. ^verse-14

**15**  And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit. ^verse-15

**16**  And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of the fruit also. ^verse-16

**17**  And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see them. ^verse-17

**18**  And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would [[#^note-18a|not]] come unto me and partake of the fruit. ^verse-18

**19**    And I beheld a [[#^note-19a|rod of iron]], and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood. ^verse-19

**20**  And I also beheld a [[#^note-20a|strait]] and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a [[#^note-20b|world]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were [[#^note-21a|pressing]] forward, that they might obtain the [[#^note-21b|path]] which led unto the tree by which I stood. ^verse-21

**22**  And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree. ^verse-22

**23**  And it came to pass that there arose a [[#^note-23a|mist]] of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were [[#^note-23b|lost]]. ^verse-23

**24**  And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, [[#^note-24a|clinging]] to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the [[#^note-24b|fruit]] of the tree. ^verse-24

**25**  And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were [[#^note-25a|ashamed]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the [[#^note-26a|other]] side of the river of water, a great and [[#^note-26b|spacious]] building; and it stood as it were in the [[#^note-26c|air]], high above the earth. ^verse-26

**27**  And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the [[#^note-27a|attitude]] of [[#^note-27b|mocking]] and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. ^verse-27

**28**  And after they had [[#^note-28a|tasted]] of the fruit they were [[#^note-28b|ashamed]], because of those that were [[#^note-28c|scoffing]] at them; and they [[#^note-28d|fell away]] into forbidden paths and were lost. ^verse-28

**29**    And now I, Nephi, do not speak [[#^note-29a|all]] the words of my father. ^verse-29

**30**  But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the [[#^note-30a|rod of iron]]; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree. ^verse-30

**31**  And he also saw other [[#^note-31a|multitudes]] feeling their way towards that great and spacious building. ^verse-31

**32**  And it came to pass that many were drowned in the [[#^note-32a|depths]] of the [[#^note-32b|fountain]]; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads. ^verse-32

**33**  And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger of [[#^note-33a|scorn]] at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not. ^verse-33

**34**  These are the words of my father: For as many as [[#^note-34a|heeded]] them, had fallen away. ^verse-34

**35**  And [[#^note-35a|Laman]] and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my father. ^verse-35

**36**  And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord. ^verse-36

**37**  And he did [[#^note-37a|exhort]] them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them. ^verse-37

**38**  And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them. ^verse-38
