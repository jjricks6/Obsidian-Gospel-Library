[[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 5|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/1 Nephi/1 Nephi 7|Next Entry]]

*Nephi writes of the things of Godâ€”Nephi's purpose is to persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham and be saved. About 600-592 B.C.*

**1**  And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in [[#^note-1a|this]] part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon these [[#^note-1b|plates]] which I am [[#^note-1c|writing]]; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my [[#^note-1d|father]]; wherefore, I do not write it in this work. ^verse-1

**2**  For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of [[#^note-2a|Joseph]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon [[#^note-3a|these plates]], for I desire the room that I may write of the things of God. ^verse-3

**4**  For the fulness of mine intent is that I may [[#^note-4a|persuade]] men to [[#^note-4b|come]] unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, the things which are [[#^note-5a|pleasing]] unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men. ^verse-6
