*Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghostâ€”Men must pray and gain knowledge for themselves from the Holy Ghost. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts? ^verse-1

**2**  Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had [[#^note-2a|received]] the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the [[#^note-2b|tongue]] of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost? ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Angels]] speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, [[#^note-3b|feast]] upon the [[#^note-3c|words]] of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will [[#^note-3d|tell]] you all things what ye should do. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye [[#^note-4a|ask]] not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark. ^verse-4

**5**    For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will [[#^note-5a|show]] unto you all things what ye should do. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall [[#^note-6a|manifest]] himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do. ^verse-6

**7**  And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the [[#^note-7a|unbelief]], and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the [[#^note-7b|stiffneckedness]] of men; for they will [[#^note-7c|not]] search [[#^note-7d|knowledge]], nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in [[#^note-7e|plainness]], even as plain as word can be. ^verse-7

**8**    And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the [[#^note-8a|Spirit]] which teacheth a man to [[#^note-8b|pray]], ye would know that ye must [[#^note-8c|pray]]; for the [[#^note-8d|evil spirit]] teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray. ^verse-8

**9**  But behold, I say unto you that ye must [[#^note-9a|pray]] always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall [[#^note-9b|pray]] unto the Father in the [[#^note-9c|name]] of Christ, that he will [[#^note-9d|consecrate]] thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the [[#^note-9e|welfare]] of thy soul. ^verse-9
