*Nephi's words are true—They testify of Christ—Those who believe in Christ will believe Nephi's words, which will stand as a witness before the judgment bar. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I [[#^note-1a|mighty]] in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man [[#^note-1b|speaketh]] by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men. ^verse-1

**2**  But behold, there are many that [[#^note-2a|harden]] their [[#^note-2b|hearts]] against the [[#^note-2c|Holy Spirit]], that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught. ^verse-2

**3**  But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great [[#^note-3a|worth]], and especially unto my people. For I [[#^note-3b|pray]] continually for them by day, and mine [[#^note-3c|eyes]] water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry. ^verse-3

**4**  And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it [[#^note-4a|persuadeth]] them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life [[#^note-4b|eternal]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And it speaketh [[#^note-5a|harshly]] against sin, according to the [[#^note-5b|plainness]] of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil. ^verse-5

**6**  I [[#^note-6a|glory]] in [[#^note-6b|plainness]]; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath [[#^note-6c|redeemed]] my soul from hell. ^verse-6

**7**  I have [[#^note-7a|charity]] for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat. ^verse-7

**8**  I have charity for the [[#^note-8a|Jew]]—I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came. ^verse-8

**9**  I also have charity for the Gentiles. But behold, for none of [[#^note-9a|these]] can I hope except they shall be [[#^note-9b|reconciled]] unto Christ, and enter into the [[#^note-9c|narrow]] [[#^note-9d|gate]], and [[#^note-9e|walk]] in the [[#^note-9f|strait]] path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of [[#^note-9g|probation]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And now, my beloved brethren, and also [[#^note-10a|Jew]], and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and [[#^note-10b|believe]] in Christ; and if ye [[#^note-10c|believe]] not in these [[#^note-10d|words]] believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these [[#^note-10e|words]], for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they [[#^note-10f|teach]] all men that they should do good. ^verse-10

**11**  And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will show unto you, with [[#^note-11a|power]] and great [[#^note-11b|glory]], that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness. ^verse-11

**12**  And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his [[#^note-12a|kingdom]] at that great and last day. ^verse-12

**13**  And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one [[#^note-13a|crying]] from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come. ^verse-13

**14**  And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the [[#^note-14a|Jews]], and also my [[#^note-14b|words]], and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall [[#^note-14c|condemn]] you at the last day. ^verse-14

**15**  For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the [[#^note-15a|judgment]] bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must [[#^note-15b|obey]]. Amen. ^verse-15
