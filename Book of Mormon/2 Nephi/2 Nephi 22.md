*In the millennial day all men will praise the Lord—He will dwell among them—Compare Isaiah 12. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, God is my salvation; I will [[#^note-2a|trust]], and not be afraid; for the Lord [[#^note-2b|Jehovah]] is my [[#^note-2c|strength]] and my [[#^note-2d|song]]; he also has become my salvation. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore, with joy shall ye draw [[#^note-3a|water]] out of the wells of salvation. ^verse-3

**4**  And in that day shall ye say: [[#^note-4a|Praise]] the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Sing]] unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|Cry]] out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. ^verse-6
