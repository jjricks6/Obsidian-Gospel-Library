### Chapter 1

[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 2|Next Entry]]

*Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—His seed will be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel—He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**  And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of teaching my brethren, our [[#^note-1a|father]], Lehi, also spake many things unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem. ^verse-1

**2**  And he spake unto them concerning their [[#^note-2a|rebellions]] upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed up in the sea. ^verse-2

**3**  And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which they had obtained—how [[#^note-3a|merciful]] the Lord had been in [[#^note-3b|warning]] us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem. ^verse-3

**4**    For, behold, said he, I have [[#^note-4a|seen]] a [[#^note-4b|vision]], in which I know that [[#^note-4c|Jerusalem]] is [[#^note-4d|destroyed]]; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have [[#^note-4e|perished]]. ^verse-4

**5**  But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a [[#^note-5a|land of promise]], a land which is [[#^note-5b|choice]] above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath [[#^note-5c|covenanted]] with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath [[#^note-5d|covenanted]] this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be [[#^note-5e|led]] out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall [[#^note-6a|none]] come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, this [[#^note-7a|land]] is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of [[#^note-7b|liberty]] unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound [[#^note-7c|cursed]] shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever. ^verse-7

**8**  And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be [[#^note-8a|kept]] as yet from the knowledge of other [[#^note-8b|nations]]; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a [[#^note-9a|promise]], that [[#^note-9b|inasmuch]] as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall [[#^note-9c|prosper]] upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall [[#^note-9d|keep]] his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their [[#^note-9e|inheritance]]; and they shall dwell safely forever. ^verse-9

**10**  But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in [[#^note-10a|unbelief]], after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord—having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true [[#^note-10b|Messiah]], their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is [[#^note-10c|just]] shall rest upon them. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, he will bring [[#^note-11a|other nations]] unto them, and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be [[#^note-11b|scattered]] and smitten. ^verse-11

**12**  Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be [[#^note-12a|bloodsheds]], and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words. ^verse-12

**13**  O that ye would awake; awake from a deep [[#^note-13a|sleep]], yea, even from the sleep of [[#^note-13b|hell]], and shake off the awful [[#^note-13c|chains]] by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal [[#^note-13d|gulf]] of misery and woe. ^verse-13

**14**  Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling [[#^note-14a|parent]], whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent [[#^note-14b|grave]], from whence no traveler can [[#^note-14c|return]]; a few more [[#^note-14d|days]] and I go the [[#^note-14e|way]] of all the earth. ^verse-14

**15**  But behold, the Lord hath [[#^note-15a|redeemed]] my soul from hell; I have beheld his [[#^note-15b|glory]], and I am encircled about eternally in the [[#^note-15c|arms]] of his [[#^note-15d|love]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And I desire that ye should remember to observe the [[#^note-16a|statutes]] and the judgments of the Lord; behold, this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning. ^verse-16

**17**  My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time, for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his [[#^note-17a|wrath]] upon you, that ye be [[#^note-17b|cut off]] and destroyed forever; ^verse-17

**18**  Or, that a [[#^note-18a|cursing]] should come upon you for the space of [[#^note-18b|many generations]]; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the [[#^note-18c|devil]]. ^verse-18

**19**  O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a [[#^note-19a|favored]] people of the Lord. But behold, his will be done; for his [[#^note-19b|ways]] are righteousness forever. ^verse-19

**20**  And he hath said that: [[#^note-20a|Inasmuch]] as ye shall keep my [[#^note-20b|commandments]] ye shall [[#^note-20c|prosper]] in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. ^verse-20

**21**  And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart might leave this world with gladness because of you, that I might not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, and be [[#^note-21a|men]], and be determined in [[#^note-21b|one]] mind and in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity; ^verse-21

**22**  That ye may not be [[#^note-22a|cursed]] with a sore cursing; and also, that ye may not incur the displeasure of a [[#^note-22b|just]] God upon you, unto the destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body. ^verse-22

**23**  Awake, my sons; put on the armor of [[#^note-23a|righteousness]]. Shake off the [[#^note-23b|chains]] with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust. ^verse-23

**24**  Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been [[#^note-24a|glorious]], and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we must have perished with [[#^note-24b|hunger]] in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to [[#^note-24c|take away]] his life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you. ^verse-24

**25**  And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye have [[#^note-25a|accused]] him that he sought power and [[#^note-25b|authority]] over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare. ^verse-25

**26**  And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used [[#^note-26a|sharpness]]; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his [[#^note-26b|sharpness]] was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities. ^verse-26

**27**  And it must needs be that the [[#^note-27a|power]] of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But behold, it was not he, but it was the [[#^note-27b|Spirit]] of the Lord which was in him, which [[#^note-27c|opened]] his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it. ^verse-27

**28**  And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a [[#^note-28a|blessing]], yea, even my first blessing. ^verse-28

**29**  But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my [[#^note-29a|first]] blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him. ^verse-29

**30**  And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the [[#^note-30a|servant]] of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true [[#^note-30b|friend]] unto my son, Nephi, forever. ^verse-30

**31**  Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed [[#^note-31a|with]] his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever. ^verse-31

**32**  Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son. ^verse-32
