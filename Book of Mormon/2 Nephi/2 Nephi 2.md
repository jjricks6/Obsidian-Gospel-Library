*Redemption comes through the Holy Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is essential to existence and progression—Adam fell that men might be—Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**    And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my [[#^note-1a|firstborn]] in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren. ^verse-1

**2**  Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine [[#^note-2a|afflictions]] for thy gain. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be [[#^note-3a|spent]] in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast [[#^note-3b|beheld]] that in the [[#^note-3c|fulness]] of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men. ^verse-3

**4**  And thou hast [[#^note-4a|beheld]] in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and [[#^note-4b|salvation]] is [[#^note-4c|free]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And men are instructed sufficiently that they [[#^note-5a|know]] good from evil. And the [[#^note-5b|law]] is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is [[#^note-5c|justified]]; or, by the law men are [[#^note-5d|cut off]]. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, [[#^note-6a|redemption]] cometh in and through the [[#^note-6b|Holy]] [[#^note-6c|Messiah]]; for he is full of [[#^note-6d|grace]] and truth. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, he offereth himself a [[#^note-7a|sacrifice]] for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto [[#^note-7b|none]] else can the [[#^note-7c|ends]] of the law be answered. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, [[#^note-8a|save]] it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who [[#^note-8b|layeth]] down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the [[#^note-8c|resurrection]] of the dead, being the first that should rise. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make [[#^note-9a|intercession]] for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved. ^verse-9

**10**  And because of the intercession for [[#^note-10a|all]], all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be [[#^note-10b|judged]] of him according to the truth and [[#^note-10c|holiness]] which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the [[#^note-10d|punishment]] which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the [[#^note-10e|atonement]]— ^verse-10

**11**  For it must needs be, that there is an [[#^note-11a|opposition]] in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no [[#^note-12a|purpose]] in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the [[#^note-12b|justice]] of God. ^verse-12

**13**  And if ye shall say there is [[#^note-13a|no law]], ye shall also say [[#^note-13b|there]] is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away. ^verse-13

**14**  And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and [[#^note-14a|learning]]; for there is a God, and he hath [[#^note-14b|created]] all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be [[#^note-14c|acted]] upon. ^verse-14

**15**  And to bring about his eternal [[#^note-15a|purposes]] in the end of man, after he had [[#^note-15b|created]] our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the [[#^note-15c|fowls]] of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the [[#^note-15d|forbidden]] [[#^note-15e|fruit]] in [[#^note-15f|opposition]] to the [[#^note-15g|tree of life]]; the one being sweet and the other bitter. ^verse-15

**16**    Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should [[#^note-16a|act]] for himself. Wherefore, man could not [[#^note-16b|act]] for himself save it should be that he was [[#^note-16c|enticed]] by the one or the other. ^verse-16

**17**  And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose that an [[#^note-17a|angel]] of God, according to that which is written, had [[#^note-17b|fallen]] from heaven; wherefore, he became a [[#^note-17c|devil]], having sought that which was evil before God. ^verse-17

**18**  And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he [[#^note-18a|sought]] also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all [[#^note-18b|lies]], wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, [[#^note-18c|knowing]] good and evil. ^verse-18

**19**    And after Adam and Eve had [[#^note-19a|partaken]] of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of [[#^note-19b|Eden]], to till the earth. ^verse-19

**20**  And they have brought forth children; yea, even the [[#^note-20a|family]] of all the earth. ^verse-20

**21**  And the days of the children of [[#^note-21a|men]] were prolonged, according to the [[#^note-21b|will]] of God, that they might [[#^note-21c|repent]] while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of [[#^note-21d|probation]], and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were [[#^note-21e|lost]], because of the transgression of their parents. ^verse-21

**22**  And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. ^verse-22

**23**  And they would have had no [[#^note-23a|children]]; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no [[#^note-23b|joy]], for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no [[#^note-23c|sin]]. ^verse-23

**24**  But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who [[#^note-24a|knoweth]] all things. ^verse-24

**25**  [[#^note-25a|Adam]] [[#^note-25b|fell]] that men might be; and men [[#^note-25c|are]], that they might have [[#^note-25d|joy]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And the [[#^note-26a|Messiah]] cometh in the fulness of time, that he may [[#^note-26b|redeem]] the children of men from the fall. And because that they are [[#^note-26c|redeemed]] from the fall they have become [[#^note-26d|free]] forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the [[#^note-26e|law]] at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given. ^verse-26

**27**  Wherefore, men are [[#^note-27a|free]] according to the [[#^note-27b|flesh]]; and [[#^note-27c|all]] things are [[#^note-27d|given]] them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to [[#^note-27e|choose]] [[#^note-27f|liberty]] and eternal [[#^note-27g|life]], through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be [[#^note-27h|miserable]] like unto himself. ^verse-27

**28**  And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great [[#^note-28a|Mediator]], and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit; ^verse-28

**29**  And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the [[#^note-29a|evil]] which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to [[#^note-29b|captivate]], to bring you down to [[#^note-29c|hell]], that he may reign over you in his own kingdom. ^verse-29

**30**  I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting [[#^note-30a|welfare]] of your souls. Amen. ^verse-30
