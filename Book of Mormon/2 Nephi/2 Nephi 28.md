### Chapter 28

[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 27|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 29|Next Entry]]

*Many false churches will be built up in the last days—They will teach false, vain, and foolish doctrines—Apostasy will abound because of false teachers—The devil will rage in the hearts of men—He will teach all manner of false doctrines. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to pass. ^verse-1

**2**  And the things which shall be written out of the [[#^note-2a|book]] shall be of great [[#^note-2b|worth]] unto the children of men, and especially unto our seed, which is a [[#^note-2c|remnant]] of the house of Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  For it shall come to pass in that day that the [[#^note-3a|churches]] which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built up [[#^note-3b|churches]], and not unto the Lord— ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their [[#^note-4a|learning]], and deny the [[#^note-4b|Holy Ghost]], which giveth utterance. ^verse-4

**5**  And they [[#^note-5a|deny]] the [[#^note-5b|power]] of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept; for behold there is [[#^note-5c|no]] God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he hath given his power unto men; ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a God of [[#^note-6a|miracles]]; he hath done his work. ^verse-6

**7**  Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: [[#^note-7a|Eat]], drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us. ^verse-7

**8**  And there shall also be many which shall say: [[#^note-8a|Eat]], drink, and be [[#^note-8b|merry]]; nevertheless, fear God—he will [[#^note-8c|justify]] in committing a little [[#^note-8d|sin]]; yea, [[#^note-8e|lie]] a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a [[#^note-8f|pit]] for thy neighbor; there is [[#^note-8g|no]] harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God. ^verse-8

**9**  Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, [[#^note-9a|false]] and vain and [[#^note-9b|foolish]] [[#^note-9c|doctrines]], and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark. ^verse-9

**10**  And the [[#^note-10a|blood]] of the saints shall cry from the ground against them. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, they have all gone out of the [[#^note-11a|way]]; they have become [[#^note-11b|corrupted]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Because of [[#^note-12a|pride]], and because of [[#^note-12b|false]] teachers, and [[#^note-12c|false doctrine]], their churches have become corrupted, and their churches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up. ^verse-12

**13**  They [[#^note-13a|rob]] the [[#^note-13b|poor]] because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart, because in their [[#^note-13c|pride]] they are puffed up. ^verse-13

**14**  They wear [[#^note-14a|stiff]] necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and [[#^note-14b|whoredoms]], they have all [[#^note-14c|gone astray]] save it be a [[#^note-14d|few]], who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are [[#^note-14e|led]], that in many instances they do [[#^note-14f|err]] because they are taught by the precepts of men. ^verse-14

**15**  O the [[#^note-15a|wise]], and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the [[#^note-15b|pride]] of their [[#^note-15c|hearts]], and all those who preach [[#^note-15d|false doctrines]], and all those who commit [[#^note-15e|whoredoms]], and pervert the right way of the Lord, [[#^note-15f|wo]], wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell! ^verse-15

**16**  Wo unto them that [[#^note-16a|turn]] aside the just for a thing of naught and [[#^note-16b|revile]] against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth! For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are [[#^note-16c|fully]] ripe in iniquity they shall perish. ^verse-16

**17**  But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-17

**18**  But behold, that great and [[#^note-18a|abominable]] church, the [[#^note-18b|whore]] of all the earth, must [[#^note-18c|tumble]] to the earth, and great must be the fall thereof. ^verse-18

**19**  For the kingdom of the devil must [[#^note-19a|shake]], and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the [[#^note-19b|devil]] will grasp them with his everlasting [[#^note-19c|chains]], and they be stirred up to anger, and perish; ^verse-19

**20**  For behold, at that day shall he [[#^note-20a|rage]] in the [[#^note-20b|hearts]] of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good. ^verse-20

**21**  And others will he [[#^note-21a|pacify]], and lull them away into carnal [[#^note-21b|security]], that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the [[#^note-21c|devil]] [[#^note-21d|cheateth]] their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. ^verse-21

**22**  And behold, others he [[#^note-22a|flattereth]] away, and telleth them there is no [[#^note-22b|hell]]; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none—and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful [[#^note-22c|chains]], from whence there is no deliverance. ^verse-22

**23**  Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be [[#^note-23a|judged]] according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a [[#^note-23b|lake]] of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment. ^verse-23

**24**  Therefore, wo be unto him that is at [[#^note-24a|ease]] in Zion! ^verse-24

**25**  Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well! ^verse-25

**26**  Yea, wo be unto him that [[#^note-26a|hearkeneth]] unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost! ^verse-26

**27**  Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we [[#^note-27a|need]] no more! ^verse-27

**28**  And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are [[#^note-28a|angry]] because of [[#^note-28b|the truth]] of God! For behold, he that is built upon the [[#^note-28c|rock]] [[#^note-28d|receiveth]] it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall. ^verse-28

**29**  Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we [[#^note-29a|need]] [[#^note-29b|no more]] of the word of God, for we have enough! ^verse-29

**30**  For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, [[#^note-30a|precept]] upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn [[#^note-30b|wisdom]]; for unto him that [[#^note-30c|receiveth]] I will give [[#^note-30d|more]]; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have. ^verse-30

**31**  Cursed is he that putteth his [[#^note-31a|trust]] in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the [[#^note-31b|precepts]] of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-31

**32**  [[#^note-32a|Wo]] be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts! For notwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and [[#^note-32b|come]] unto me; for mine [[#^note-32c|arm]] is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord God of Hosts. ^verse-32
