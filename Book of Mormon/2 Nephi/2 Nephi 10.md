*Jacob explains that the Jews will crucify their God—They will be scattered until they begin to believe in Him—America will be a land of liberty where no king will rule—Reconcile yourselves to God and gain salvation through His grace. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous [[#^note-1a|branch]] of which I have spoken. ^verse-1

**2**  For behold, the [[#^note-2a|promises]] which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of [[#^note-2b|unbelief]], nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be [[#^note-2c|restored]], that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer. ^verse-2

**3**    Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ—for in the last night the [[#^note-3a|angel]] spake unto me that this should be his name—should [[#^note-3b|come]] among the [[#^note-3c|Jews]], among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall [[#^note-3d|crucify]] him—for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would [[#^note-3e|crucify]] their [[#^note-3f|God]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For should the mighty [[#^note-4a|miracles]] be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be their God. ^verse-4

**5**  But because of [[#^note-5a|priestcrafts]] and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will [[#^note-5b|stiffen]] their necks against him, that he be [[#^note-5c|crucified]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, [[#^note-6a|pestilences]], and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be [[#^note-6b|scattered]] among all nations. ^verse-6

**7**  But behold, thus saith the [[#^note-7a|Lord God]]: [[#^note-7b|When]] the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be [[#^note-7c|restored]] in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the [[#^note-7d|lands]] of their inheritance. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass that they shall be [[#^note-8a|gathered]] in from their long dispersion, from the [[#^note-8b|isles]] of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in [[#^note-8c|carrying]] them forth to the lands of their inheritance. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Yea]], the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore, the [[#^note-9b|promises]] of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute? ^verse-9

**10**  But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the [[#^note-10a|Gentiles]] shall be blessed upon the land. ^verse-10

**11**  And this land shall be a land of [[#^note-11a|liberty]] unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no [[#^note-11b|kings]] upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles. ^verse-11

**12**  And I will fortify this land [[#^note-12a|against]] all other nations. ^verse-12

**13**  And he that [[#^note-13a|fighteth]] against Zion shall [[#^note-13b|perish]], saith God. ^verse-13

**14**  For he that raiseth up a [[#^note-14a|king]] against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the [[#^note-14b|king]] of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a [[#^note-14c|light]] unto them forever, that hear my words. ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore, for this cause, that my [[#^note-15a|covenants]] may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the [[#^note-15b|secret]] works of [[#^note-15c|darkness]], and of murders, and of abominations. ^verse-15

**16**  Wherefore, he that [[#^note-16a|fighteth]] against [[#^note-16b|Zion]], both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, [[#^note-16c|shall]] perish; for [[#^note-16d|they]] are they who are the [[#^note-16e|whore]] of all the earth; for [[#^note-16f|they]] who are [[#^note-16g|not]] for me are [[#^note-16h|against]] me, saith our God. ^verse-16

**17**  For I will [[#^note-17a|fulfil]] my [[#^note-17b|promises]] which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh— ^verse-17

**18**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will [[#^note-18a|soften]] the hearts of the [[#^note-18b|Gentiles]], that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be [[#^note-18c|blessed]] and [[#^note-18d|numbered]] among the house of Israel. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, I will [[#^note-19a|consecrate]] this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God. ^verse-19

**20**  And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been [[#^note-20a|driven out]] of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a [[#^note-20b|better land]], for the Lord has made the sea our [[#^note-20c|path]], and we are upon an [[#^note-20d|isle]] of the sea. ^verse-20

**21**  But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the [[#^note-21a|isles]] of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren. ^verse-21

**22**  For behold, the Lord God has [[#^note-22a|led away]] from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us also. ^verse-22

**23**  Therefore, [[#^note-23a|cheer up]] your hearts, and remember that ye are [[#^note-23b|free]] to [[#^note-23c|act]] for yourselves—to [[#^note-23d|choose]] the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life. ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, [[#^note-24a|reconcile]] yourselves to the [[#^note-24b|will]] of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the [[#^note-24c|grace]] of God that ye are [[#^note-24d|saved]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Wherefore, may God [[#^note-25a|raise]] you from death by the power of the resurrection, and also from everlasting death by the power of the [[#^note-25b|atonement]], that ye may be received into the [[#^note-25c|eternal]] kingdom of God, that ye may praise him through grace divine. Amen. ^verse-25
