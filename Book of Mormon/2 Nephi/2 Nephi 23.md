*The destruction of Babylon is a type of the destruction at the Second Coming—It will be a day of wrath and vengeance—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—Compare Isaiah 13. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|The burden]] of [[#^note-1b|Babylon]], which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. ^verse-1

**2**  Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, [[#^note-2a|shake the hand]], that they may go into the gates of the nobles. ^verse-2

**3**  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my [[#^note-3a|mighty]] ones, for mine anger is not upon them that rejoice in my highness. ^verse-3

**4**  The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a great people, a tumultuous noise of the [[#^note-4a|kingdoms]] of nations [[#^note-4b|gathered]] together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle. ^verse-4

**5**  They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. ^verse-5

**6**  Howl ye, for the [[#^note-6a|day]] of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore shall all hands be faint, every man's heart shall [[#^note-7a|melt]]; ^verse-7

**8**  And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall [[#^note-9a|destroy]] the sinners thereof out of it. ^verse-9

**10**  For the [[#^note-10a|stars]] of heaven and the [[#^note-10b|constellations]] thereof shall not give their [[#^note-10c|light]]; the [[#^note-10d|sun]] shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will [[#^note-11a|punish]] the world for evil, and the [[#^note-11b|wicked]] for their iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy of the [[#^note-11c|proud]] to cease, and will lay down the haughtiness of the terrible. ^verse-11

**12**  I will make a [[#^note-12a|man]] more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. ^verse-12

**13**  Therefore, I will [[#^note-13a|shake]] the heavens, and the earth shall [[#^note-13b|remove]] out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. ^verse-13

**14**  And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up; and they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own [[#^note-14a|land]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Every one that is proud shall be thrust through; yea, and every one that is [[#^note-15a|joined]] to the wicked shall fall by the sword. ^verse-15

**16**  Their [[#^note-16a|children]] also shall be [[#^note-16b|dashed]] to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished. ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, I will stir up the [[#^note-17a|Medes]] against them, which shall not regard silver and gold, nor shall they delight in it. ^verse-17

**18**  Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no [[#^note-18a|pity]] on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children. ^verse-18

**19**  And [[#^note-19a|Babylon]], the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew [[#^note-19b|Sodom]] and Gomorrah. ^verse-19

**20**  It shall never be [[#^note-20a|inhabited]], neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. ^verse-20

**21**  But [[#^note-21a|wild]] beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. ^verse-21

**22**  And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her day shall not be prolonged. For I will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish. ^verse-22
