*Jacob continues reading from Isaiah: In the last days, the Lord will comfort Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed will come to Zion amid great joy—Compare Isaiah 51 and 52:1-2. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Hearken]] unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look unto the [[#^note-1b|rock]] from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged. ^verse-1

**2**  Look unto Abraham, your [[#^note-2a|father]], and unto [[#^note-2b|Sarah]], she that bare you; for I called him alone, and blessed him. ^verse-2

**3**  For the Lord shall [[#^note-3a|comfort]] [[#^note-3b|Zion]], he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her [[#^note-3c|wilderness]] like [[#^note-3d|Eden]], and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody. ^verse-3

**4**  Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for a [[#^note-4a|law]] shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a [[#^note-4b|light]] for the people. ^verse-4

**5**  My righteousness is near; my [[#^note-5a|salvation]] is gone forth, and mine arm shall [[#^note-5b|judge]] the people. The [[#^note-5c|isles]] shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. ^verse-5

**6**  Lift up your eyes to the [[#^note-6a|heavens]], and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall [[#^note-6b|vanish]] away like smoke, and the earth shall [[#^note-6c|wax old]] like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. ^verse-6

**7**  Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart I have written my law, [[#^note-7a|fear]] ye not the [[#^note-7b|reproach]] of men, neither be ye afraid of their [[#^note-7c|revilings]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For the [[#^note-8a|moth]] shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from generation to generation. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Awake]], awake! Put on [[#^note-9b|strength]], O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut [[#^note-9c|Rahab]], and wounded the [[#^note-9d|dragon]]? ^verse-9

**10**  Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a [[#^note-10a|way]] for the ransomed to pass over? ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore, the [[#^note-11a|redeemed]] of the Lord shall [[#^note-11b|return]], and come with [[#^note-11c|singing]] unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and [[#^note-11d|mourning]] shall flee away. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|I]] am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be [[#^note-12b|afraid]] of man, who shall die, and of the son of man, who shall be made like unto [[#^note-12c|grass]]? ^verse-12

**13**  And [[#^note-13a|forgettest]] the Lord thy maker, that hath [[#^note-13b|stretched]] forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the [[#^note-13c|oppressor]], as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor? ^verse-13

**14**  The [[#^note-14a|captive]] exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. ^verse-14

**15**  But I am the Lord thy God, whose [[#^note-15a|waves]] roared; the Lord of Hosts is my name. ^verse-15

**16**  And I have [[#^note-16a|put]] my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my [[#^note-16b|people]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the [[#^note-17a|cup]] of his [[#^note-17b|fury]]—thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling wrung out— ^verse-17

**18**  And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she hath brought up. ^verse-18

**19**  These two [[#^note-19a|sons]] are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for thee—thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword—and by whom shall I comfort thee? ^verse-19

**20**  Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God. ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and [[#^note-21a|drunken]], and not with wine: ^verse-21

**22**  Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God [[#^note-22a|pleadeth]] the cause of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again. ^verse-22

**23**  But [[#^note-23a|I]] will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over—and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over. ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Awake]], awake, put on thy [[#^note-24b|strength]], O [[#^note-24c|Zion]]; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall [[#^note-24d|no more]] come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. ^verse-24

**25**  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the [[#^note-25a|bands]] of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. ^verse-25
