*Jacob continues reading from Isaiah: Isaiah speaks messianically—The Messiah will have the tongue of the learned—He will give His back to the smiters—He will not be confounded—Compare Isaiah 50. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Yea]], for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the [[#^note-1b|bill]] of your mother's [[#^note-1c|divorcement]]? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my [[#^note-1d|creditors]] have I [[#^note-1e|sold]] you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I [[#^note-2a|called]], yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I [[#^note-2b|dry up]] the [[#^note-2c|sea]], I make their [[#^note-2d|rivers]] a wilderness and their [[#^note-2e|fish]] to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst. ^verse-2

**3**  I clothe the heavens with [[#^note-3a|blackness]], and I make [[#^note-3b|sackcloth]] their covering. ^verse-3

**4**  The Lord God hath given me the [[#^note-4a|tongue]] of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of Israel. When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord God hath opened mine [[#^note-5a|ear]], and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. ^verse-5

**6**  I gave my back to the [[#^note-6a|smiter]], and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from [[#^note-6b|shame]] and spitting. ^verse-6

**7**  For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be [[#^note-7a|ashamed]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And the Lord is near, and he [[#^note-8a|justifieth]] me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me, and I will [[#^note-8b|smite]] him with the strength of my mouth. ^verse-8

**9**  For the Lord God will help me. And all they who shall [[#^note-9a|condemn]] me, behold, all they shall [[#^note-9b|wax old]] as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up. ^verse-9

**10**  Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the [[#^note-10a|voice]] of his servant, that [[#^note-10b|walketh]] in darkness and hath no light? ^verse-10

**11**  Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass [[#^note-11a|your]]selves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled. [[#^note-11b|This]] shall ye have of mine hand—ye shall lie down in sorrow. ^verse-11
