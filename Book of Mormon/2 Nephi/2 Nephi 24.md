[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 23|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 25|Next Entry]]

*Israel will be gathered and will enjoy millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out of heaven for rebellion—Israel will triumph over Babylon (the world)—Compare Isaiah 14. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|For]] the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet [[#^note-1b|choose]] Israel, and set them in their own land; and the [[#^note-1c|strangers]] shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. ^verse-1

**2**  And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return to their [[#^note-2a|lands of promise]]. And the house of Israel shall [[#^note-2b|possess]] them, and the land of the Lord shall be for [[#^note-2c|servants]] and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall [[#^note-2d|rule]] over their oppressors. ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee [[#^note-3a|rest]], from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve. ^verse-3

**4**  And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb [[#^note-4a|against]] the king of [[#^note-4b|Babylon]], and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased! ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord hath broken the staff of the [[#^note-5a|wicked]], the scepters of the rulers. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|He]] who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. ^verse-6

**7**  The whole earth is at [[#^note-7a|rest]], and is quiet; they break forth into [[#^note-7b|singing]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Hell]] from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the [[#^note-9b|dead]] for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. ^verse-9

**10**  All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us? ^verse-10

**11**  Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols is not heard; the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|How]] art thou fallen from heaven, O [[#^note-12b|Lucifer]], son of the morning! Art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations! ^verse-12

**13**  For thou hast said in thy heart: [[#^note-13a|I]] will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|I]] will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. ^verse-14

**15**  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the [[#^note-15a|pit]]. ^verse-15

**16**  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and shall consider thee, and shall say: Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms? ^verse-16

**17**  And made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners? ^verse-17

**18**  All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, lie in glory, every one of them in his own house. ^verse-18

**19**  But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet. ^verse-19

**20**  Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people; the [[#^note-20a|seed]] of [[#^note-20b|evil-doers]] shall never be renowned. ^verse-20

**21**  Prepare slaughter for his children for the [[#^note-21a|iniquities]] of their fathers, that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. ^verse-21

**22**  For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off from Babylon the [[#^note-22a|name]], and remnant, and son, and [[#^note-22b|nephew]], saith the Lord. ^verse-22

**23**  I will also make it a [[#^note-23a|possession]] for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-23

**24**  The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand— ^verse-24

**25**  That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot; then shall his [[#^note-25a|yoke]] depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. ^verse-25

**26**  This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations. ^verse-26

**27**  For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? ^verse-27

**28**  In the year that king [[#^note-28a|Ahaz]] died was this burden. ^verse-28

**29**  Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that [[#^note-29a|smote]] thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his [[#^note-29b|fruit]] shall be a [[#^note-29c|fiery flying serpent]]. ^verse-29

**30**  And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. ^verse-30

**31**  Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved; for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. ^verse-31

**32**  What shall then answer the messengers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded [[#^note-32a|Zion]], and the [[#^note-32b|poor]] of his people shall trust in it. ^verse-32
