### Chapter 16

[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 15|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 17|Next Entry]]

*Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah's sins are forgiven—He is called to prophesy—He prophesies of the rejection by the Jews of Christ's teachings—A remnant will return—Compare Isaiah 6. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|In]] the [[#^note-1b|year]] that king Uzziah died, I [[#^note-1c|saw]] also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. ^verse-1

**2**  Above it stood the [[#^note-2a|seraphim]]; each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. ^verse-2

**3**  And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his [[#^note-3a|glory]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. ^verse-4

**5**  Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have [[#^note-5a|seen]] the King, the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-5

**6**  Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; ^verse-6

**7**  And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine [[#^note-7a|iniquity]] is taken away, and thy sin purged. ^verse-7

**8**  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: [[#^note-8a|Whom]] shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: Here am I; send me. ^verse-8

**9**  And he said: Go and tell this people—Hear ye indeed, but they understood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not. ^verse-9

**10**  Make the [[#^note-10a|hear]]t of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes—lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their [[#^note-10b|heart]], and be converted and be healed. ^verse-10

**11**  Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate; ^verse-11

**12**  And the Lord have [[#^note-12a|removed]] men far away, for there shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. ^verse-12

**13**  But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the [[#^note-13a|holy seed]] shall be the substance thereof. ^verse-13
