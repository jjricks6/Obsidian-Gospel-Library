*Many Gentiles will reject the Book of Mormon—They will say, We need no more Bible—The Lord speaks to many nations—He will judge the world out of the books which will be written. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  But behold, there shall be many—at that day when I shall proceed to do a [[#^note-1a|marvelous work]] among them, that I may remember my [[#^note-1b|covenants]] which I have made unto the children of men, that I may set my hand again the [[#^note-1c|second]] time to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel; ^verse-1

**2**  And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the [[#^note-2a|words]] of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall [[#^note-2b|hiss]] forth unto the [[#^note-2c|ends]] of the earth, for a [[#^note-2d|standard]] unto my people, which are of the house of Israel; ^verse-2

**3**  And because my words shall hiss forth—many of the Gentiles shall say: A [[#^note-3a|Bible]]! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible. ^verse-3

**4**  But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a [[#^note-4a|Bible]]; and it shall proceed forth from the [[#^note-4b|Jews]], mine ancient covenant people. And what [[#^note-4c|thank]] they the [[#^note-4d|Jews]] for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles? ^verse-4

**5**  O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have [[#^note-5a|cursed]] them, and have [[#^note-5b|hated]] them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou fool, that shall say: A [[#^note-6a|Bible]], we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews? ^verse-6

**7**  Know ye not that there are more [[#^note-7a|nations]] than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the [[#^note-7b|isles]] of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the [[#^note-7c|earth]] beneath; and I bring forth my [[#^note-7d|word]] unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth? ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the [[#^note-8a|testimony]] of [[#^note-8b|two]] nations is a [[#^note-8c|witness]] unto you that I am God, that I remember one [[#^note-8d|nation]] like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two [[#^note-8e|nations]] shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also. ^verse-8

**9**  And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the [[#^note-9a|same]] yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my [[#^note-9b|words]] according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken one [[#^note-9c|word]] ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my [[#^note-9d|work]] is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my [[#^note-10a|words]]; neither [[#^note-10b|need]] ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written. ^verse-10

**11**  For I command [[#^note-11a|all]] men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall [[#^note-11b|write]] the words which I speak unto them; for out of the [[#^note-11c|books]] which shall be written I will [[#^note-11d|judge]] the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written. ^verse-11

**12**  For behold, I shall speak unto the [[#^note-12a|Jews]] and they shall [[#^note-12b|write]] it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall [[#^note-12c|write]] it; and I sh[[#^note-12d|all]] also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it. ^verse-12

**13**  And it shall come to pass that the [[#^note-13a|Jews]] shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the [[#^note-13b|lost tribes]] of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews. ^verse-13

**14**  And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the [[#^note-14a|house of Israel]], shall be gathered home unto the [[#^note-14b|lands]] of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in [[#^note-14c|one]]. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my [[#^note-14d|people]], who are of the [[#^note-14e|house of Israel]], that I am God, and that I [[#^note-14f|covenanted]] with [[#^note-14g|Abraham]] that I would remember his [[#^note-14h|seed]] [[#^note-14i|forever]]. ^verse-14
