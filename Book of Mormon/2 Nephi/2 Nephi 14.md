*Zion and her daughters will be redeemed and cleansed in the millennial day—Compare Isaiah 4. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] in that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name to take away our [[#^note-1b|reproach]]. ^verse-1

**2**  In that day shall the [[#^note-2a|branch]] of the Lord be beautiful and glorious; the fruit of the earth excellent and comely to them that are escaped of Israel. ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall come to pass, they that are [[#^note-3a|left]] in Zion and remain in Jerusalem shall be called holy, every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem— ^verse-3

**4**  When the Lord shall have [[#^note-4a|washed]] away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of [[#^note-4b|burning]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And the [[#^note-5a|Lord]] will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a [[#^note-5b|cloud]] and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall be a defence. ^verse-5

**6**  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of [[#^note-6a|refuge]], and a covert from storm and from rain. ^verse-6
