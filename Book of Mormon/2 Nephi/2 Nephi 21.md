*The stem of Jesse (Christ) will judge in righteousness—The knowledge of God will cover the earth in the Millennium—The Lord will raise an ensign and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 11. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|And]] there shall [[#^note-1b|come]] forth a rod out of the [[#^note-1c|stem of Jesse]], and a [[#^note-1d|branch]] shall grow out of his roots. ^verse-1

**2**  And the [[#^note-2a|Spirit]] of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of [[#^note-2b|wisdom]] and [[#^note-2c|understanding]], the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; ^verse-2

**3**  And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; and he shall not [[#^note-3a|judge]] after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears. ^verse-3

**4**  But with [[#^note-4a|righteousness]] shall he [[#^note-4b|judge]] the poor, and reprove with equity for the [[#^note-4c|meek]] of the earth; and he shall [[#^note-4d|smite]] the earth with the [[#^note-4e|rod]] of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. ^verse-4

**5**  And [[#^note-5a|righteousness]] shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. ^verse-5

**6**  The [[#^note-6a|wolf]] also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. ^verse-6

**7**  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. ^verse-7

**8**  And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den. ^verse-8

**9**  They shall [[#^note-9a|not]] hurt nor [[#^note-9b|destroy]] in all my holy mountain, for the [[#^note-9c|earth]] shall be full of the [[#^note-9d|knowledge]] of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. ^verse-9

**10**  And in that day there shall be a [[#^note-10a|root of Jesse]], which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the [[#^note-10b|Gentiles]] seek; and his [[#^note-10c|rest]] shall be glorious. ^verse-10

**11**  And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the [[#^note-11a|second]] time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left, from [[#^note-11b|Assyria]], and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from [[#^note-11c|Shinar]], and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. ^verse-11

**12**  And he shall set up an [[#^note-12a|ensign]] for the nations, and shall assemble the [[#^note-12b|outcasts]] of Israel, and [[#^note-12c|gather]] together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|envy]] of Ephraim also shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not [[#^note-13b|envy]] [[#^note-13c|Judah]], and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. ^verse-13

**14**  But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the [[#^note-14a|Philistines]] towards the west; they shall spoil them of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon [[#^note-14b|Edom]] and [[#^note-14c|Moab]]; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. ^verse-14

**15**  And the Lord shall utterly [[#^note-15a|destroy]] the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind he shall shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over [[#^note-15b|dry]] shod. ^verse-15

**16**  And there shall be a [[#^note-16a|highway]] for the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. ^verse-16
