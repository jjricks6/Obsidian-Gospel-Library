*Isaiah speaks messianically—The people in darkness will see a great light—Unto us a child is born—He will be the Prince of Peace and will reign on David's throne—Compare Isaiah 9. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Nevertheless]], the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the [[#^note-1b|land]] of [[#^note-1c|Zebulun]], and the land of [[#^note-1d|Naphtali]], and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations. ^verse-1

**2**  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. ^verse-2

**3**  Thou hast multiplied the nation, and [[#^note-3a|increased]] the joy—they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. ^verse-3

**4**  For thou hast broken the yoke of [[#^note-4a|his]] burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his [[#^note-4b|oppressor]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but [[#^note-5a|this]] shall be with burning and fuel of fire. ^verse-5

**6**  For unto us a [[#^note-6a|child]] is born, unto us a son is given; and the [[#^note-6b|government]] shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The [[#^note-6c|Mighty God]], The [[#^note-6d|Everlasting Father]], The Prince of [[#^note-6e|Peace]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Of the increase of [[#^note-7a|government]] and peace [[#^note-7b|there]] is no end, upon the throne of [[#^note-7c|David]], and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this. ^verse-7

**8**  The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel. ^verse-8

**9**  And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart: ^verse-9

**10**  The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn [[#^note-10a|stones]]; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into [[#^note-10b|cedars]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of [[#^note-11a|Rezin]] against him, and join his enemies together; ^verse-11

**12**  The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall [[#^note-12a|devour]] Israel with open mouth. For all this his [[#^note-12b|anger]] is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. ^verse-12

**13**  For the people turneth not unto [[#^note-13a|him]] that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush [[#^note-14a|in]] one day. ^verse-14

**15**  The [[#^note-15a|ancient]], he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. ^verse-15

**16**  For the [[#^note-16a|leaders]] of this people cause them to err; and they that are [[#^note-16b|led]] of them are destroyed. ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have [[#^note-17a|mercy]] on their fatherless and [[#^note-17b|widows]]; for [[#^note-17c|every]] one of them is a hypocrite and an [[#^note-17d|evildoer]], and every mouth speaketh [[#^note-17e|folly]]. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his [[#^note-17f|hand]] is stretched out still. ^verse-17

**18**  For [[#^note-18a|wickedness]] burneth as the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. ^verse-18

**19**  Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the [[#^note-19a|land]] darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; [[#^note-19b|no man]] shall spare his brother. ^verse-19

**20**  And he [[#^note-20a|shall]] snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall [[#^note-20b|eat]] on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm— ^verse-20

**21**  Manasseh, [[#^note-21a|Ephraim]]; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together shall be against [[#^note-21b|Judah]]. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. ^verse-21
