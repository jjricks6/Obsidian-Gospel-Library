[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 12|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 14|Next Entry]]

*Judah and Jerusalem will be punished for their disobedience—The Lord pleads for and judges His people—The daughters of Zion are cursed and tormented for their worldliness—Compare Isaiah 3. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|For]] behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole staff of bread, and the whole stay of water— ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|mighty]] man, and the man of [[#^note-2b|war]], the judge, and the prophet, and the [[#^note-2c|prudent]], and the ancient; ^verse-2

**3**  The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. ^verse-3

**4**  And I will give children unto them to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. ^verse-4

**5**  And the people shall be [[#^note-5a|oppressed]], every one by another, and every one by his neighbor; the child shall behave himself [[#^note-5b|proudly]] against the ancient, and the base against the honorable. ^verse-5

**6**  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, and shall say: Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let not this [[#^note-6a|ruin]] come under thy hand— ^verse-6

**7**  In that day shall he swear, saying: I will not be a healer; for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; make me not a ruler of the people. ^verse-7

**8**  For Jerusalem is [[#^note-8a|ruined]], and Judah is [[#^note-8b|fallen]], because their [[#^note-8c|tongues]] and their doings have been against the Lord, to [[#^note-8d|provoke]] the eyes of his glory. ^verse-8

**9**  The show of their countenance doth witness against them, and doth declare their [[#^note-9a|sin]] to be even as [[#^note-9b|Sodom]], and they cannot hide it. Wo unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves! ^verse-9

**10**  Say unto the righteous that it is [[#^note-10a|well]] with them; for they shall [[#^note-10b|eat]] the fruit of their doings. ^verse-10

**11**  Wo unto the wicked, for they shall perish; for the reward of their hands shall be upon them! ^verse-11

**12**  And my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who [[#^note-12a|lead]] thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths. ^verse-12

**13**  The Lord standeth up to [[#^note-13a|plead]], and standeth to judge the people. ^verse-13

**14**  The Lord will enter into [[#^note-14a|judgment]] with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the [[#^note-14b|vineyard]] and the spoil of the [[#^note-14c|poor]] in your houses. ^verse-14

**15**  What mean ye? Ye [[#^note-15a|beat]] my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts. ^verse-15

**16**  Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters of Zion are [[#^note-16a|haughty]], and [[#^note-16b|walk]] with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet— ^verse-16

**17**  Therefore the Lord will smite with a [[#^note-17a|scab]] the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will [[#^note-17b|discover]] their secret parts. ^verse-17

**18**  In that [[#^note-18a|day]] the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon; ^verse-18

**19**  The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers; ^verse-19

**20**  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; ^verse-20

**21**  The rings, and nose jewels; ^verse-21

**22**  The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins; ^verse-22

**23**  The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils. ^verse-23

**24**  And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, [[#^note-24a|baldness]]; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; [[#^note-24b|burning]] instead of [[#^note-24c|beauty]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. ^verse-25

**26**  And her [[#^note-26a|gates]] shall lament and [[#^note-26b|mourn]]; and she shall be desolate, and shall [[#^note-26c|sit]] upon the ground. ^verse-26
