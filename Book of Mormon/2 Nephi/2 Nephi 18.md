### Chapter 18

[[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 17|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/2 Nephi/2 Nephi 19|Next Entry]]

*Christ will be as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, not peeping wizards—Turn to the law and to the testimony for guidance—Compare Isaiah 8. About 559-545 B.C.*

**1**  Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me: Take thee a great [[#^note-1a|roll]], and write in it with a man's pen, concerning [[#^note-1b|Maher-shalal-hash-baz]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And I took unto me faithful [[#^note-2a|witnesses]] to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. ^verse-2

**3**  And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me: [[#^note-3a|Call]] his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz. ^verse-3

**4**  For behold, [[#^note-4a|the child]] shall [[#^note-4b|not]] have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, before the riches of Damascus and the [[#^note-4c|spoil]] of [[#^note-4d|Samaria]] shall be taken away before the king of [[#^note-4e|Assyria]]. ^verse-4

**5**  The Lord spake also unto me again, saying: ^verse-5

**6**  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of [[#^note-6a|Shiloah]] that go softly, and rejoice in [[#^note-6b|Rezin]] and Remaliah's son; ^verse-6

**7**  Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of [[#^note-7a|Assyria]] and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks. ^verse-7

**8**  And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall [[#^note-8a|reach]] even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Associate]] yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. ^verse-9

**10**  Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us. ^verse-10

**11**  For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: ^verse-11

**12**  Say ye not, A [[#^note-12a|confederacy]], to all to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. ^verse-12

**13**  Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. ^verse-13

**14**  And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a [[#^note-14a|stone]] of [[#^note-14b|stumbling]], and for a [[#^note-14c|rock]] of [[#^note-14d|offense]] to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and a [[#^note-14e|snare]] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ^verse-14

**15**  And many among them shall [[#^note-15a|stumble]] and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Bind]] up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. ^verse-16

**17**  And I will wait upon the Lord, that [[#^note-17a|hideth]] his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for [[#^note-18a|signs]] and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth in Mount Zion. ^verse-18

**19**  And when they shall say unto you: Seek unto them that have [[#^note-19a|familiar spirits]], and unto [[#^note-19b|wizards]] that peep and mutter—[[#^note-19c|should not]] a people seek unto their God for the living to hear from the dead? ^verse-19

**20**  To the [[#^note-20a|law]] and to the testimony; and if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. ^verse-20

**21**  And they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. ^verse-21

**22**  And they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble, and [[#^note-22a|darkness]], dimness of anguish, and shall be driven to darkness. ^verse-22
