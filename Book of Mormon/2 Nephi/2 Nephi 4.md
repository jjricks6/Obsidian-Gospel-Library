*Lehi counsels and blesses his posterity—He dies and is buried—Nephi glories in the goodness of God—Nephi puts his trust in the Lord forever. About 588-570 B.C.*

**1**  And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning [[#^note-1a|Joseph]], who was carried into Egypt. ^verse-1

**2**  For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the [[#^note-2a|prophecies]] which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the [[#^note-2b|plates of brass]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold, my sons, and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my [[#^note-3a|firstborn]], I would that ye should give ear unto my words. ^verse-3

**4**  For the Lord God hath said that: [[#^note-4a|Inasmuch]] as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. ^verse-4

**5**    But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my grave save I should leave a [[#^note-5a|blessing]] upon you; for behold, I know that if ye are [[#^note-5b|brought up]] in the [[#^note-5c|way]] ye should go ye will not depart from it. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, if ye are [[#^note-6a|cursed]], behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the [[#^note-6b|cursing]] may be taken from you and be answered upon the [[#^note-6c|heads]] of your parents. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will [[#^note-7a|not]] suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be [[#^note-7b|merciful]] unto you and unto your seed forever. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him. ^verse-8

**9**  And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed. ^verse-9

**10**  And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of [[#^note-10a|Ishmael]], yea, and even all his household. ^verse-10

**11**  And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy [[#^note-11a|seed]]; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days. ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had [[#^note-12a|spoken]] unto all his househ[[#^note-12b|old]], according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried. ^verse-12

**13**  And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were [[#^note-13a|angry]] with me because of the admonitions of the Lord. ^verse-13

**14**  For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine [[#^note-14a|other plates]]; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates. ^verse-14

**15**  And upon [[#^note-15a|these]] I [[#^note-15b|write]] the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul [[#^note-15c|delighteth]] in the scriptures, and my heart [[#^note-15d|pondereth]] them, and writeth them for the [[#^note-15e|learning]] and the profit of my children. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, my [[#^note-16a|soul]] delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my [[#^note-16b|heart]] pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard. ^verse-16

**17**    Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great [[#^note-17a|goodness]] of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O [[#^note-17b|wretched]] man that I am! Yea, my heart [[#^note-17c|sorroweth]] because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities. ^verse-17

**18**  I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily [[#^note-18a|beset]] me. ^verse-18

**19**  And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have [[#^note-19a|trusted]]. ^verse-19

**20**  My God hath been my [[#^note-20a|support]]; he hath led me through mine [[#^note-20b|afflictions]] in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. ^verse-20

**21**  He hath filled me with his [[#^note-21a|love]], even unto the [[#^note-21b|consuming]] of my flesh. ^verse-21

**22**  He hath confounded mine [[#^note-22a|enemies]], unto the causing of them to quake before me. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me [[#^note-23a|knowledge]] by [[#^note-23b|visions]] in the night-time. ^verse-23

**24**  And by day have I waxed bold in mighty [[#^note-24a|prayer]] before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto me. ^verse-24

**25**  And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been [[#^note-25a|carried away]] upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them. ^verse-25

**26**  O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath [[#^note-26a|visited]] men in so much [[#^note-26b|mercy]], [[#^note-26c|why]] should my [[#^note-26d|heart]] weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? ^verse-26

**27**  And why should I [[#^note-27a|yield]] to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to [[#^note-27b|temptations]], that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my [[#^note-27c|peace]] and afflict my soul? Why am I [[#^note-27d|angry]] because of mine enemy? ^verse-27

**28**  Awake, my soul! No longer [[#^note-28a|droop]] in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the [[#^note-28b|enemy]] of my soul. ^verse-28

**29**  Do not [[#^note-29a|anger]] again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions. ^verse-29

**30**  Rejoice, O my [[#^note-30a|heart]], and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the [[#^note-30b|rock]] of my salvation. ^verse-30

**31**  O Lord, wilt thou [[#^note-31a|redeem]] my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of [[#^note-31b|sin]]? ^verse-31

**32**  May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my [[#^note-32a|heart]] is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may [[#^note-32b|walk]] in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road! ^verse-32

**33**  O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy [[#^note-33a|righteousness]]! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine [[#^note-33b|enemies]]! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way—but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy. ^verse-33

**34**  O Lord, I have [[#^note-34a|trusted]] in thee, and I will [[#^note-34b|trust]] in thee forever. I will not put my [[#^note-34c|trust]] in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his [[#^note-34d|trust]] in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm. ^verse-34

**35**  Yea, I know that God will give [[#^note-35a|liberally]] to him that [[#^note-35b|ask]]eth. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask [[#^note-35c|not]] amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the [[#^note-35d|rock]] of my [[#^note-35e|righteousness]]. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen. ^verse-35
