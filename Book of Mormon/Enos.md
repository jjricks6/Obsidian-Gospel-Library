# The Book of Enos

### Chapter 1

[[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 7|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Jarom|Next Entry]]

*Enos prays mightily and gains a remission of his sins—The voice of the Lord comes into his mind, promising salvation for the Lamanites in a future day—The Nephites sought to reclaim the Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his Redeemer. About 420 B.C.*

**1**  Behold, it came to pass that I, [[#^note-1a|Enos]], knowing my fat[[#^note-1b|he]]r that he was a just man—for he [[#^note-1c|taught]] me in his language, and also in the [[#^note-1d|nurture]] and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it— ^verse-1

**2**  And I will tell you of the [[#^note-2a|wrestle]] which I had before God, before I received a [[#^note-2b|remission]] of my sins. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the [[#^note-3a|joy]] of the saints, [[#^note-3b|sunk]] deep into my heart. ^verse-3

**4**    And my soul [[#^note-4a|hungered]]; and I [[#^note-4b|kneeled]] down before my Maker, and I [[#^note-4c|cried]] unto him in mighty [[#^note-4d|prayer]] and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens. ^verse-4

**5**  And there came a [[#^note-5a|voice]] unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are [[#^note-5b|forgiven]] thee, and thou shalt be blessed. ^verse-5

**6**  And I, Enos, knew that God [[#^note-6a|could]] not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away. ^verse-6

**7**  And I said: Lord, how is it done? ^verse-7

**8**  And he said unto me: [[#^note-8a|Because]] of thy [[#^note-8b|faith]] in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee [[#^note-8c|whole]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a [[#^note-9a|desire]] for the [[#^note-9b|welfare]] of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did [[#^note-9c|pour out]] my whole soul unto God for them. ^verse-9

**10**  And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my [[#^note-10a|mind]] again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I have [[#^note-10b|given]] unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I [[#^note-10c|curse]] it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their [[#^note-10d|transgressions]] will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads. ^verse-10

**11**  And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my [[#^note-11a|faith]] began to be [[#^note-11b|unshaken]] in the Lord; and I [[#^note-11c|prayed]] unto him with many long [[#^note-11d|strugglings]] for my brethren, the Lamanites. ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass that after I had [[#^note-12a|prayed]] and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy [[#^note-12b|desires]], because of thy faith. ^verse-12

**13**  And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him—that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be [[#^note-13a|destroyed]], and the Lamanites should not be [[#^note-13b|destroyed]], that the Lord God would [[#^note-13c|preserve]] a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be [[#^note-13d|brought forth]] at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be [[#^note-13e|brought]] unto salvation— ^verse-13

**14**  For at the present our strugglings were [[#^note-14a|vain]] in restoring them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would [[#^note-14b|destroy]] our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers. ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to [[#^note-15a|preserve]] our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it. ^verse-15

**16**  And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would [[#^note-16a|preserve]] the [[#^note-16b|records]]; and he covenanted with me that he would [[#^note-16c|bring]] [[#^note-16d|them]] forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time. ^verse-16

**17**  And I, Enos, [[#^note-17a|knew]] it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest. ^verse-17

**18**  And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine. ^verse-18

**19**  And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen. ^verse-19

**20**  And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to [[#^note-20a|restore]] the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our [[#^note-20b|labors]] were vain; their [[#^note-20c|hatred]] was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a [[#^note-20d|blood-thirsty]] people, full of [[#^note-20e|idolatry]] and [[#^note-20f|filthiness]]; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in [[#^note-20g|tents]], and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the [[#^note-20h|bow]], and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us. ^verse-20

**21**  And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and [[#^note-21a|raise]] all manner of grain, and of fruit, and [[#^note-21b|flocks]] of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses. ^verse-21

**22**  And there were exceedingly many [[#^note-22a|prophets]] among us. And the people were a [[#^note-22b|stiffnecked]] people, hard to understand. ^verse-22

**23**  And there was nothing save it was exceeding [[#^note-23a|harshness]], [[#^note-23b|preaching]] and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually [[#^note-23c|reminding]] them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things—stirring them up [[#^note-23d|continually]] to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them. ^verse-23

**24**  And I saw [[#^note-24a|wars]] between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of my days. ^verse-24

**25**  And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father Lehi [[#^note-25a|left]] Jerusalem. ^verse-25

**26**  And I saw that I [[#^note-26a|must]] soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world. ^verse-26

**27**  And I soon go to the place of my [[#^note-27a|rest]], which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall [[#^note-27b|rest]]. And I rejoice in the day when my [[#^note-27c|mortal]] shall put on [[#^note-27d|immortality]], and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the [[#^note-27e|mansions]] of my Father. Amen. ^verse-27
