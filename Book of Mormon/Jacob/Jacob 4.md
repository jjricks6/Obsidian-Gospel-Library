### Chapter 4

[[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 3|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Jacob/Jacob 5|Next Entry]]

*All the prophets worshiped the Father in the name of Christ—Abraham's offering of Isaac was in similitude of God and His Only Begotten—Men should reconcile themselves to God through the Atonement—The Jews will reject the foundation stone. About 544-421 B.C.*

**1**  Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a [[#^note-1a|little]] of my words, because of the [[#^note-1b|difficulty]] of engraving our words upon plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain; ^verse-1

**2**  But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon [[#^note-2a|plates]] must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers— ^verse-2

**3**  Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first [[#^note-3a|parents]]. ^verse-3

**4**  For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we [[#^note-4a|knew]] of Christ, and we had a hope of his [[#^note-4b|glory]] many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy [[#^note-4c|prophets]] which were before us. ^verse-4

**5**    Behold, they believed in Christ and [[#^note-5a|worshiped]] the Father in his [[#^note-5b|name]], and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we [[#^note-5c|keep]] the [[#^note-5d|law]] of Moses, it [[#^note-5e|pointing]] our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a [[#^note-5f|similitude]] of God and his [[#^note-5g|Only Begotten Son]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of [[#^note-6a|prophecy]]; and having all these [[#^note-6b|witnesses]] we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can [[#^note-6c|command]] in the [[#^note-6d|name]] of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea. ^verse-6

**7**  Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our [[#^note-7a|weakness]] that we may know that it is by his [[#^note-7b|grace]], and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things. ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, great and marvelous are the [[#^note-8a|works]] of the Lord. How [[#^note-8b|unsearchable]] are the depths of the [[#^note-8c|mysteries]] of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man [[#^note-8d|knoweth]] of his [[#^note-8e|ways]] save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the [[#^note-8f|revelations]] of God. ^verse-8

**9**  For behold, by the power of his [[#^note-9a|word]] [[#^note-9b|man]] came upon the face of the earth, which earth was [[#^note-9c|created]] by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the [[#^note-9d|earth]], or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure? ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, brethren, seek not to [[#^note-10a|counsel]] the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in [[#^note-10b|wisdom]], and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, beloved brethren, be [[#^note-11a|reconciled]] unto him through the [[#^note-11b|atonement]] of Christ, his [[#^note-11c|Only Begotten Son]], and ye may obtain a [[#^note-11d|resurrection]], according to the [[#^note-11e|power]] of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the [[#^note-11f|first-fruits]] of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh. ^verse-11

**12**  And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not [[#^note-12a|speak]] of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come? ^verse-12

**13**  Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the [[#^note-13a|Spirit]] speaketh the [[#^note-13b|truth]] and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really [[#^note-13c|are]], and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us [[#^note-13d|plainly]], for the salvation of our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also [[#^note-13e|spake]] them unto prophets of old. ^verse-13

**14**  But behold, the Jews were a [[#^note-14a|stiffnecked]] people; and they [[#^note-14b|despised]] the words of [[#^note-14c|plainness]], and [[#^note-14d|killed]] the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their [[#^note-14e|blindness]], which [[#^note-14f|blindness]] came by looking beyond the [[#^note-14g|mark]], they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they [[#^note-14h|cannot]] understand, because they desired it. And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may [[#^note-14i|stumble]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the [[#^note-15a|stumbling]] of the [[#^note-15b|Jews]] they will [[#^note-15c|reject]] the [[#^note-15d|stone]] upon which they might build and have safe foundation. ^verse-15

**16**  But behold, according to the scriptures, this [[#^note-16a|stone]] shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure [[#^note-16b|foundation]], upon which the Jews can build. ^verse-16

**17**  And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can [[#^note-17a|ever]] build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner? ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you. ^verse-18
