*The pure in heart receive the pleasing word of God—Lamanite righteousness exceeds that of the Nephites—Jacob warns against fornication, lasciviousness, and every sin. About 544-421 B.C.*

**1**    But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and [[#^note-1a|pray]] unto him with exceeding faith, and he will [[#^note-1b|console]] you in your [[#^note-1c|afflictions]], and he will plead your cause, and send down [[#^note-1d|justice]] upon those who seek your destruction. ^verse-1

**2**  O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his [[#^note-2a|love]]; for ye may, if your [[#^note-2b|minds]] are [[#^note-2c|firm]], forever. ^verse-2

**3**  But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is [[#^note-3a|cursed]] for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not [[#^note-3b|filthy]] like unto you, nevertheless they are [[#^note-3c|cursed]] with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction. ^verse-3

**4**  And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will [[#^note-4a|lead]] away the righteous out from among you. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not [[#^note-5a|forgotten]] the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father—that they should have save it were [[#^note-5b|one]] wife, and [[#^note-5c|concubines]] they should have none, and there should not be [[#^note-5d|whoredoms]] committed among them. ^verse-5

**6**  And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be [[#^note-6a|merciful]] unto them; and one day they shall [[#^note-6b|become]] a blessed people. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, their [[#^note-7a|husbands]] [[#^note-7b|love]] their [[#^note-7c|wives]], and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their [[#^note-7d|unbelief]] and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator? ^verse-7

**8**  O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be [[#^note-8a|whiter]] than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye [[#^note-9a|revile]] no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, ye shall remember your [[#^note-10a|children]], how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the [[#^note-10b|example]] that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day. ^verse-10

**11**  O my brethren, hearken unto my words; [[#^note-11a|arouse]] the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may [[#^note-11b|awake]] from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of [[#^note-11c|hell]] that ye may not become [[#^note-11d|angels]] to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second [[#^note-11e|death]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, [[#^note-12a|warning]] them against [[#^note-12b|fornication]] and [[#^note-12c|lasciviousness]], and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them. ^verse-12

**13**  And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon [[#^note-13a|these plates]]; but many of their proceedings are written upon the [[#^note-13b|larger plates]], and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings. ^verse-13

**14**  [[#^note-14a|These]] plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were [[#^note-14b|made]] by the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking these words. ^verse-14
