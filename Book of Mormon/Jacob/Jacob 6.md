*The Lord will recover Israel in the last days—The world will be burned with fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid the lake of fire and brimstone. About 544-421 B.C.*

**1**  And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would prophesy, behold, this is my prophecy—that the things which this prophet [[#^note-1a|Zenos]] spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which he likened them unto a tame [[#^note-1b|olive tree]], must surely come to pass. ^verse-1

**2**  And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to [[#^note-2a|recover]] his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the [[#^note-2b|servants]] of the Lord shall go forth in his [[#^note-2c|power]], to [[#^note-2d|nourish]] and prune his [[#^note-2e|vineyard]]; and after that the [[#^note-2f|end]] soon cometh. ^verse-2

**3**  And how [[#^note-3a|blessed]] are they who have labored [[#^note-3b|diligently]] in his vineyard; and how [[#^note-3c|cursed]] are they who shall be cast out into their own place! And the [[#^note-3d|world]] shall be [[#^note-3e|burned]] with fire. ^verse-3

**4**  And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of [[#^note-4a|Israel]], both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his [[#^note-4b|hands]] unto them all the day long; and they are a [[#^note-4c|stiffnecked]] and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and [[#^note-5a|cleave]] unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his [[#^note-5b|arm]] of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts. ^verse-5

**6**  Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; for why will ye [[#^note-6a|die]]? ^verse-6

**7**  For behold, after ye have been nourished by the good [[#^note-7a|word]] of God all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that ye must be [[#^note-7b|hewn]] down and cast into the fire? ^verse-7

**8**  Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye reject the words of the [[#^note-8a|prophets]]; and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning him; and [[#^note-8b|deny]] the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and the [[#^note-8c|gift]] of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a [[#^note-8d|mock]] of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you? ^verse-8

**9**  Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of the redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will bring you to stand with [[#^note-9a|shame]] and [[#^note-9b|awful]] [[#^note-9c|guilt]] before the bar of God? ^verse-9

**10**  And according to the power of [[#^note-10a|justice]], for justice cannot be denied, ye must go away into that [[#^note-10b|lake]] of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is [[#^note-10c|endless]] [[#^note-10d|torment]]. ^verse-10

**11**  O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the [[#^note-11a|strait gate]], and [[#^note-11b|continue]] in the way which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal life. ^verse-11

**12**  O be [[#^note-12a|wise]]; what can I say more? ^verse-12

**13**  Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet you before the [[#^note-13a|pleasing]] bar of God, which bar striketh the wicked with [[#^note-13b|awful]] dread and fear. Amen. ^verse-13
