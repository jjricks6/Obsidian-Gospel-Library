*The brother of Jared sees the finger of the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—Christ shows His spirit body to the brother of Jared—Those who have a perfect knowledge cannot be kept from within the veil—Interpreters are provided to bring the Jaredite record to light.*

**1**    And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the [[#^note-1a|mount]], which they called the mount [[#^note-1b|Shelem]], because of its exceeding height, and did [[#^note-1c|molten]] out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent [[#^note-1d|glass]]; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying: ^verse-1

**2**  O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be [[#^note-2a|angry]] with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are [[#^note-2b|unworthy]] before thee; because of the [[#^note-2c|fall]] our [[#^note-2d|natures]] have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been [[#^note-3a|merciful]] unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these [[#^note-3b|things]] which I have molten out of the rock. ^verse-3

**4**  And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all [[#^note-4a|power]], and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy [[#^note-4b|finger]], and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have [[#^note-4c|light]] while we shall cross the sea. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which [[#^note-5a|looks]] small unto the understanding of men. ^verse-5

**6**  And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the [[#^note-6a|Lord]] stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his [[#^note-6b|finger]]. And the [[#^note-6c|veil]] was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared [[#^note-6d|fell down]] before the Lord, for he was struck with [[#^note-6e|fear]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen? ^verse-7

**8**  And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should [[#^note-8a|smite]] me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood. ^verse-8

**9**  And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me [[#^note-9a|flesh and blood]]; and never has man come before me with [[#^note-9b|such]] exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this? ^verse-9

**10**  And he answered: Nay; Lord, [[#^note-10a|show]] thyself unto me. ^verse-10

**11**  And the Lord said unto him: [[#^note-11a|Believest]] thou the words which I shall speak? ^verse-11

**12**  And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and [[#^note-12a|canst]] not lie. ^verse-12

**13**  And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord [[#^note-13a|showed]] himself unto him, and said: [[#^note-13b|Because]] thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my [[#^note-13c|presence]]; therefore I [[#^note-13d|show]] myself unto you. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, I am he who was [[#^note-14a|prepared]] from the foundation of the world to [[#^note-14b|redeem]] my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the [[#^note-14c|Father]] and the Son. In me shall all mankind have [[#^note-14d|life]], and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my [[#^note-14e|sons]] and my daughters. ^verse-14

**15**  And never have I [[#^note-15a|showed]] myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man [[#^note-15b|believed]] in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own [[#^note-15c|image]]? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, this [[#^note-16a|body]], which ye now [[#^note-16b|behold]], is the [[#^note-16c|body]] of my [[#^note-16d|spirit]]; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh. ^verse-16

**17**  And now, as I, Moroni, said I could [[#^note-17a|not]] make a full account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus [[#^note-17b|showed]] himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he showed himself unto the Nephites. ^verse-17

**18**  And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, because of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him. ^verse-18

**19**  And because of the [[#^note-19a|knowledge]] of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the [[#^note-19b|veil]]; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had [[#^note-19c|faith]] no longer, for he knew, nothing [[#^note-19d|doubting]]. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could [[#^note-20a|not]] be kept from within the veil; therefore he [[#^note-20b|saw]] Jesus; and he did minister unto him. ^verse-20

**21**  And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the [[#^note-21a|time]] cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall [[#^note-21b|treasure]] up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man. ^verse-21

**22**  And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye shall write them in a [[#^note-22a|language]] that they cannot be read. ^verse-22

**23**  And behold, these [[#^note-23a|two]] stones will I give unto thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write. ^verse-23

**24**  For behold, the [[#^note-24a|language]] which ye shall write I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write. ^verse-24

**25**  And when the Lord had said these words, he [[#^note-25a|showed]] unto the brother of Jared [[#^note-25b|all]] the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he [[#^note-25c|withheld]] them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-25

**26**  For he had said unto him in times before, that [[#^note-26a|if]] he would [[#^note-26b|believe]] in him that he could show unto him [[#^note-26c|all]] things—it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things. ^verse-26

**27**  And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and [[#^note-27a|seal]] them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. ^verse-27

**28**  And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up the two [[#^note-28a|stones]] which he had received, and show them not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of [[#^note-28b|men]]. ^verse-28
