### Chapter 12

[[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 11|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Ether/Ether 13|Next Entry]]

*The prophet Ether exhorts the people to believe in God—Moroni recounts the wonders and marvels done by faith—Faith enabled the brother of Jared to see Christ—The Lord gives men weakness that they may be humble—The brother of Jared moved Mount Zerin by faith—Faith, hope, and charity are essential to salvation—Moroni saw Jesus face to face.*

**1**  And it came to pass that the days of Ether were in the days of [[#^note-1a|Coriantumr]]; and Coriantumr was king over all the land. ^verse-1

**2**  And [[#^note-2a|Ether]] was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came forth in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not be [[#^note-2b|restrained]] because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him. ^verse-2

**3**  For he did [[#^note-3a|cry]] from the [[#^note-3b|morning]], even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be [[#^note-3c|destroyed]], saying unto them that [[#^note-3d|by]] [[#^note-3e|faith]] all things are fulfilled— ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with [[#^note-4a|surety]] [[#^note-4b|hope]] for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which [[#^note-4c|hope]] cometh of [[#^note-4d|faith]], maketh an [[#^note-4e|anchor]] to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in [[#^note-4f|good works]], being led to [[#^note-4g|glorify]] God. ^verse-4

**5**  And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe, because they [[#^note-5a|saw]] them not. ^verse-5

**6**  And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that [[#^note-6a|faith]] is things which are [[#^note-6b|hoped]] for and [[#^note-6c|not]] seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no [[#^note-6d|witness]] until after the [[#^note-6e|trial]] of your faith. ^verse-6

**7**  For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed [[#^note-7a|not]] himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world. ^verse-7

**8**  But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold it was by faith that they of old were [[#^note-10a|called]] after the holy order of God. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the [[#^note-11a|gift]] of his Son hath God prepared a more [[#^note-11b|excellent]] way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled. ^verse-11

**12**  For if there be no [[#^note-12a|faith]] among the children of men God can do no [[#^note-12b|miracle]] among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith. ^verse-12

**13**  Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the [[#^note-13a|prison]] to tumble to the earth. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the [[#^note-14a|change]] upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and with the [[#^note-14b|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, it was the faith of [[#^note-15a|Ammon]] and his brethren which [[#^note-15b|wrought]] so great a miracle among the Lamanites. ^verse-15

**16**  Yea, and even all they who wrought [[#^note-16a|miracles]] wrought them by [[#^note-16b|faith]], even those who were before Christ and also those who were after. ^verse-16

**17**  And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should [[#^note-17a|not]] taste of death; and they obtained not the promise until after their faith. ^verse-17

**18**  And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God. ^verse-18

**19**  And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even [[#^note-19a|before]] Christ came, who could not be kept from within the [[#^note-19b|veil]], but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad. ^verse-19

**20**  And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his [[#^note-20a|finger]] he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith. ^verse-20

**21**  And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the [[#^note-21a|promise]] which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the [[#^note-21b|veil]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the [[#^note-22a|promise]] that these things should come unto their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ. ^verse-22

**23**  And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will [[#^note-23a|mock]] at these things, because of our [[#^note-23b|weakness]] in writing; for Lord thou hast made us [[#^note-23c|mighty]] in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them; ^verse-23

**24**  And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the [[#^note-24a|awkwardness]] of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in [[#^note-24b|writing]] like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he [[#^note-24c|wrote]] were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them. ^verse-24

**25**  Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we [[#^note-25a|cannot]] write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our [[#^note-25b|weakness]], and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall [[#^note-25c|mock]] at our words. ^verse-25

**26**  And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: [[#^note-26a|Fools]] [[#^note-26b|mock]], but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness; ^verse-26

**27**  And if men come unto me I will show unto them their [[#^note-27a|weakness]]. I [[#^note-27b|give]] unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my [[#^note-27c|grace]] is sufficient for all men that [[#^note-27d|humble]] themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make [[#^note-27e|weak]] things become strong unto them. ^verse-27

**28**  Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that [[#^note-28a|faith]], hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all [[#^note-28b|righteousness]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was [[#^note-29a|comforted]], and said: O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest unto the children of men according to their faith; ^verse-29

**30**  For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, [[#^note-30a|Remove]]—and it was removed. And if he had not had faith it would not have moved; wherefore thou workest after men have faith. ^verse-30

**31**  For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for [[#^note-31a|after]] they had [[#^note-31b|faith]], and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power. ^verse-31

**32**  And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the [[#^note-32a|mansions]] of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent [[#^note-32b|hope]]; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared. ^verse-32

**33**  And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast [[#^note-33a|loved]] the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men. ^verse-33

**34**  And now I know that this [[#^note-34a|love]] which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father. ^verse-34

**35**  Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not [[#^note-35a|charity]], because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and [[#^note-35b|take away]] their [[#^note-35c|talent]], yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly. ^verse-35

**36**  And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles [[#^note-36a|grace]], that they might have charity. ^verse-36

**37**  And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made [[#^note-37a|clean]]. And because thou hast seen thy [[#^note-37b|weakness]] thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. ^verse-37

**38**  And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the [[#^note-38a|judgment-seat]] of Christ, where all men shall know that my [[#^note-38b|garments]] are not spotted with your blood. ^verse-38

**39**  And then shall ye know that I have [[#^note-39a|seen]] Jesus, and that he hath talked with me [[#^note-39b|face to face]], and that he told me in [[#^note-39c|plain]] humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things; ^verse-39

**40**  And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing. ^verse-40

**41**  And now, I would commend you to [[#^note-41a|seek]] this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth [[#^note-41b|record]] of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen. ^verse-41
