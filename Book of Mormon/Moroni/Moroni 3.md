*Elders ordain priests and teachers by the laying on of hands. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  The manner which the disciples, who were called the [[#^note-1a|elders]] of the church, [[#^note-1b|ordained]] [[#^note-1c|priests]] and teachersâ€” ^verse-1

**2**  After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they [[#^note-2a|laid]] their hands upon them, and said: ^verse-2

**3**  In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest (or if he be a [[#^note-3a|teacher]], I ordain you to be a teacher) to preach repentance and [[#^note-3b|remission]] of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen. ^verse-3

**4**  And after this manner did they [[#^note-4a|ordain]] priests and teachers, according to the [[#^note-4b|gifts]] and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the [[#^note-4c|power]] of the Holy Ghost, which was in them. ^verse-4
