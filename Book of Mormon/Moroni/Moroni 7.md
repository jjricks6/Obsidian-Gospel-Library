### Chapter 7

[[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 6|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 8|Next Entry]]

*An invitation is given to enter into the rest of the Lord—Pray with real intent—The Spirit of Christ enables men to know good from evil—Satan persuades men to deny Christ and do evil—The prophets manifest the coming of Christ—By faith, miracles are wrought and angels minister—Men should hope for eternal life and cleave unto charity. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which he spake concerning [[#^note-1a|faith]], hope, and charity; for after this manner did he speak unto the people, as he taught them in the [[#^note-1b|synagogue]] which they had built for the place of worship. ^verse-1

**2**  And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the [[#^note-2a|grace]] of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his [[#^note-2b|calling]] unto me, that I am permitted to speak unto you at this time. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the [[#^note-3a|church]], that are the [[#^note-3b|peaceable]] followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient [[#^note-3c|hope]] by which ye can enter into the [[#^note-3d|rest]] of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven. ^verse-3

**4**  And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your peaceable [[#^note-4a|walk]] with the children of men. ^verse-4

**5**  For I remember the word of God which saith by their [[#^note-5a|works]] ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also. ^verse-5

**6**  For behold, God hath said a man being [[#^note-6a|evil]] cannot do that which is good; for if he [[#^note-6b|offereth]] a gift, or [[#^note-6c|prayeth]] unto God, except he shall do it with real [[#^note-6d|intent]] it profiteth him nothing. ^verse-6

**7**  For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness. ^verse-7

**8**  For behold, if a man being [[#^note-8a|evil]] giveth a gift, he doeth it [[#^note-8b|grudgingly]]; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God. ^verse-8

**9**  And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with [[#^note-9a|real intent]] of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good; neither will he give a good gift. ^verse-10

**11**  For behold, a bitter [[#^note-11a|fountain]] cannot bring forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot [[#^note-11b|follow]] Christ; and if he follow Christ he cannot be a [[#^note-11c|servant]] of the devil. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, all things which are [[#^note-12a|good]] cometh of God; and that which is [[#^note-12b|evil]] cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to [[#^note-12c|sin]], and to do that which is evil continually. ^verse-12

**13**  But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do [[#^note-13a|good]] continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and [[#^note-13b|enticeth]] to do [[#^note-13c|good]], and to love God, and to serve him, is [[#^note-13d|inspired]] of God. ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is [[#^note-14a|evil]] to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil. ^verse-14

**15**  For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to [[#^note-15a|judge]], that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night. ^verse-15

**16**  For behold, the [[#^note-16a|Spirit of Christ]] is given to every [[#^note-16b|man]], that he may [[#^note-16c|know]] good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. ^verse-16

**17**  But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do [[#^note-17a|evil]], and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him. ^verse-17

**18**  And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the [[#^note-18a|light]] by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same [[#^note-18b|judgment]] which ye judge ye shall also be judged. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the [[#^note-19a|light of Christ]] that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a [[#^note-19b|child]] of Christ. ^verse-19

**20**  And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every good thing? ^verse-20

**21**  And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing. ^verse-21

**22**  For behold, God [[#^note-22a|knowing]] all things, being from [[#^note-22b|everlasting]] to everlasting, behold, he sent [[#^note-22c|angels]] to minister unto the children of men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in Christ there should come every good thing. ^verse-22

**23**  And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ should come. ^verse-23

**24**  And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest things unto the children of men, which were good; and all things which are good cometh of Christ; otherwise men were [[#^note-24a|fallen]], and there could no good thing come unto them. ^verse-24

**25**  Wherefore, by the ministering of [[#^note-25a|angels]], and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ. ^verse-25

**26**  And after that he came men also were [[#^note-26a|saved]] by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the [[#^note-26b|sons]] of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: [[#^note-26c|Whatsoever]] thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you. ^verse-26

**27**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have [[#^note-27a|miracles]] ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to [[#^note-27b|claim]] of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men? ^verse-27

**28**  For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will [[#^note-28a|cleave]] unto every good thing; wherefore he [[#^note-28b|advocateth]] the cause of the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens. ^verse-28

**29**  And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have [[#^note-29a|angels]] ceased to minister unto the children of men. ^verse-29

**30**  For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of [[#^note-30a|godliness]]. ^verse-30

**31**  And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the [[#^note-31a|chosen]] vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him. ^verse-31

**32**  And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the [[#^note-32a|residue]] of men may have [[#^note-32b|faith]] in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men. ^verse-32

**33**  And Christ hath said: [[#^note-33a|If]] ye will have [[#^note-33b|faith]] in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is [[#^note-33c|expedient]] in me. ^verse-33

**34**  And he hath said: [[#^note-34a|Repent]] all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved. ^verse-34

**35**  And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with [[#^note-35a|power]] and great glory at the last [[#^note-35b|day]], that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased? ^verse-35

**36**  Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he [[#^note-36a|withheld]] the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved? ^verse-36

**37**  Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that [[#^note-37a|miracles]] are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of [[#^note-37b|unbelief]], and all is vain. ^verse-37

**38**  For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made. ^verse-38

**39**  But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not [[#^note-39a|fit]] to be numbered among the people of his church. ^verse-39

**40**  And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning [[#^note-40a|hope]]. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope? ^verse-40

**41**  And what is it that ye shall [[#^note-41a|hope]] for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have [[#^note-41b|hope]] through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life [[#^note-41c|eternal]], and this because of your faith in him according to the promise. ^verse-41

**42**  Wherefore, if a man have [[#^note-42a|faith]] he [[#^note-42b|must]] needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope. ^verse-42

**43**  And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be [[#^note-43a|meek]], and lowly of heart. ^verse-43

**44**  If so, his [[#^note-44a|faith]] and hope is vain, for none is [[#^note-44b|acceptable]] before God, save the [[#^note-44c|meek]] and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and [[#^note-44d|confesses]] by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity. ^verse-44

**45**  And [[#^note-45a|charity]] suffereth long, and is [[#^note-45b|kind]], and [[#^note-45c|envieth]] not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily [[#^note-45d|provoked]], thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. ^verse-45

**46**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail— ^verse-46

**47**  But [[#^note-47a|charity]] is the pure [[#^note-47b|love]] of Christ, and it endureth [[#^note-47c|forever]]; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him. ^verse-47

**48**  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, [[#^note-48a|pray]] unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true [[#^note-48b|followers]] of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may [[#^note-48c|be]]come the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be [[#^note-48d|purified]] even as he is pure. Amen. ^verse-48
