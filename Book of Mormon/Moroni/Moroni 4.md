*How elders and priests administer the sacramental bread is explained. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|manner]] of their [[#^note-1b|elders]] and priests administering the flesh and blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it [[#^note-1c|according]] to the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the manner to be true; and the elder or priest did minister itâ€” ^verse-1

**2**  And they did kneel down with the [[#^note-2a|church]], and pray to the Father in the name of Christ, saying: ^verse-2

**3**  O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and [[#^note-3a|sanctify]] this [[#^note-3b|bread]] to the souls of all those who partake of it; that they may eat in [[#^note-3c|remembrance]] of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the [[#^note-3d|name]] of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his [[#^note-3e|Spirit]] to be with them. Amen. ^verse-3
