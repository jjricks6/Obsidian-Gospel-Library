### Chapter 10

[[Book of Mormon/Moroni/Moroni 9|Previous Entry]]  ||  [[Book of Mormon/Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide|Next Entry]]

*A testimony of the Book of Mormon comes by the power of the Holy Ghost—The gifts of the Spirit are dispensed to the faithful—Spiritual gifts always accompany faith—Moroni's words speak from the dust—Come unto Christ, be perfected in Him, and sanctify your souls. About A.D. 421.*

**1**    Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the [[#^note-1a|Lamanites]]; and I would that they should know that more than [[#^note-1b|four hundred and twenty]] years have passed away since the sign was given of the coming of Christ. ^verse-1

**2**  And I [[#^note-2a|seal]] up [[#^note-2b|these records]], after I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how [[#^note-3a|merciful]] the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and [[#^note-3b|ponder]] it in your [[#^note-3c|hearts]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would [[#^note-4a|ask]] God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not [[#^note-4b|true]]; and if ye shall ask with a [[#^note-4c|sincere heart]], with [[#^note-4d|real intent]], having [[#^note-4e|faith]] in Christ, he will [[#^note-4f|manifest]] the [[#^note-4g|truth]] of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-4

**5**  And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may [[#^note-5a|know]] the [[#^note-5b|truth]] of all things. ^verse-5

**6**  And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is. ^verse-6

**7**  And ye may [[#^note-7a|know]] that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, [[#^note-7b|according]] to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever. ^verse-7

**8**  And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the [[#^note-8a|gifts]] of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are [[#^note-8b|different]] ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the [[#^note-8c|Spirit]] of God unto men, to profit them. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|For]] behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may [[#^note-9b|teach]] the word of wisdom; ^verse-9

**10**  And to another, that he may [[#^note-10a|teach]] the word of [[#^note-10b|knowledge]] by the same Spirit; ^verse-10

**11**  And to another, exceedingly great [[#^note-11a|faith]]; and to another, the gifts of [[#^note-11b|healing]] by the same Spirit; ^verse-11

**12**  And again, to another, that he may work mighty [[#^note-12a|miracles]]; ^verse-12

**13**  And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things; ^verse-13

**14**  And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits; ^verse-14

**15**  And again, to another, all kinds of tongues; ^verse-15

**16**  And again, to another, the interpretation of [[#^note-16a|languages]] and of divers kinds of tongues. ^verse-16

**17**  And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as he will. ^verse-17

**18**  And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that [[#^note-18a|every]] good [[#^note-18b|gift]] cometh of Christ. ^verse-18

**19**  And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he is the [[#^note-19a|same]] yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the [[#^note-19b|unbelief]] of the children of men. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore, there must be [[#^note-20a|faith]]; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity. ^verse-20

**21**  And except ye have [[#^note-21a|charity]] ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope. ^verse-21

**22**  And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in [[#^note-22a|despair]]; and despair cometh because of iniquity. ^verse-22

**23**  And Christ truly said unto our fathers: [[#^note-23a|If]] ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me. ^verse-23

**24**  And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be [[#^note-24a|because]] of [[#^note-24b|unbelief]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be [[#^note-25a|none]] that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God. ^verse-25

**26**  And wo unto them who shall do these things away and [[#^note-26a|die]], for they die in their [[#^note-26b|sins]], and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ; and I lie not. ^verse-26

**27**  And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my [[#^note-27a|words]] unto you, which were written by this man, like as one [[#^note-27b|crying]] from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the [[#^note-27c|dust]]? ^verse-27

**28**  I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall [[#^note-28a|hiss]] forth from generation to generation. ^verse-28

**29**  And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is [[#^note-29a|true]]. ^verse-29

**30**  And again I would exhort you that ye would [[#^note-30a|come]] unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good [[#^note-30b|gift]], and [[#^note-30c|touch not]] the evil gift, nor the [[#^note-30d|unclean thing]]. ^verse-30

**31**  And [[#^note-31a|awake]], and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of [[#^note-31b|Zion]]; and [[#^note-31c|strengthen]] thy [[#^note-31d|stakes]] and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest [[#^note-31e|no more]] be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled. ^verse-31

**32**  Yea, [[#^note-32a|come]] unto Christ, and be [[#^note-32b|perfected]] in him, and [[#^note-32c|deny]] yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and [[#^note-32d|love]] God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be [[#^note-32e|perfect]] in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. ^verse-32

**33**  And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye [[#^note-33a|sanctified]] in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the [[#^note-33b|blood]] of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your [[#^note-33c|sins]], that ye become [[#^note-33d|holy]], without spot. ^verse-33

**34**  And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to [[#^note-34a|rest]] in the [[#^note-34b|paradise]] of God, until my [[#^note-34c|spirit]] and body shall again [[#^note-34d|reunite]], and I am brought forth triumphant through the [[#^note-34e|air]], to meet you before the [[#^note-34f|pleasing]] bar of the great [[#^note-34g|Jehovah]], the Eternal [[#^note-34h|Judge]] of both quick and dead. Amen. ^verse-34
