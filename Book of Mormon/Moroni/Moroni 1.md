*Moroni writes for the benefit of the Lamanitesâ€”The Nephites who will not deny Christ are put to death. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed [[#^note-1a|not]] to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me. ^verse-1

**2**  For behold, their [[#^note-2a|wars]] are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because of their [[#^note-2b|hatred]] they [[#^note-2c|put to death]] every Nephite that will not deny the Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  And I, Moroni, will not [[#^note-3a|deny]] the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of [[#^note-4a|worth]] unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord. ^verse-4
