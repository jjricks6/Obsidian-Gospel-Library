*Repentant persons are baptized and fellowshipped—Church members who repent are forgiven—Meetings are conducted by the power of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought forth [[#^note-1a|fruit]] meet that they were [[#^note-1b|worthy]] of it. ^verse-1

**2**  Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a [[#^note-2a|broken]] [[#^note-2b|heart]] and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins. ^verse-2

**3**  And none were received unto baptism save they [[#^note-3a|took upon]] them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end. ^verse-3

**4**  And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and [[#^note-4a|cleansed]] by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the [[#^note-4b|church]] of Christ; and their [[#^note-4c|names]] were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually [[#^note-4d|watchful]] unto prayer, [[#^note-4e|relying]] alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith. ^verse-4

**5**    And the [[#^note-5a|church]] did meet together [[#^note-5b|oft]], to [[#^note-5c|fast]] and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls. ^verse-5

**6**  And they did [[#^note-6a|meet]] together oft to partake of bread and wine, in [[#^note-6b|remembrance]] of the Lord Jesus. ^verse-6

**7**  And they were strict to observe that there should be [[#^note-7a|no iniquity]] among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and [[#^note-7b|three]] witnesses of the church did condemn them before the [[#^note-7c|elders]], and if they repented not, and [[#^note-7d|confessed]] not, their names were [[#^note-7e|blotted out]], and they were not [[#^note-7f|numbered]] among the people of Christ. ^verse-7

**8**  But [[#^note-8a|as]] oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real [[#^note-8b|intent]], they were [[#^note-8c|forgiven]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And their meetings were [[#^note-9a|conducted]] by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the [[#^note-9b|power]] of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done. ^verse-9
