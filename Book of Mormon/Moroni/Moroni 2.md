*Jesus gave the twelve Nephite disciples power to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**    The words of Christ, which he spake unto his [[#^note-1a|disciples]], the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon themâ€” ^verse-1

**2**  And he [[#^note-2a|call]]ed them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this ye shall have [[#^note-2b|power]] that to him upon whom ye shall lay your [[#^note-2c|hands]], [[#^note-2d|ye]] shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles. ^verse-2

**3**  Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as many as they [[#^note-3a|laid]] their hands, fell the Holy Ghost. ^verse-3
