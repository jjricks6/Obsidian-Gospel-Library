*The baptism of little children is an evil abomination—Little children are alive in Christ because of the Atonement—Faith, repentance, meekness and lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to salvation. About A.D. 401-21.*

**1**  An epistle of my [[#^note-1a|father]] Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me soon after my calling to the ministry. And on this wise did he write unto me, saying: ^verse-1

**2**  My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his ministry, and to his holy work. ^verse-2

**3**  I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite [[#^note-3a|goodness]] and [[#^note-3b|grace]], will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end. ^verse-3

**4**  And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should [[#^note-4a|disputations]] rise among you. ^verse-4

**5**  For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your little children. ^verse-5

**6**  And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle. ^verse-6

**7**  For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the [[#^note-7a|word]] of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying: ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Listen]] to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the [[#^note-8b|whole]] need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little [[#^note-8c|children]] are [[#^note-8d|whole]], for they are not capable of committing [[#^note-8e|sin]]; wherefore the curse of [[#^note-8f|Adam]] is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of [[#^note-8g|circumcision]] is done away in me. ^verse-8

**9**  And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn [[#^note-9a|mockery]] before God, that ye should baptize little children. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach—repentance and baptism unto those who are [[#^note-10a|accountable]] and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little [[#^note-10b|children]], and they shall all be saved with their little children. ^verse-10

**11**  And their little [[#^note-11a|children]] need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the [[#^note-11b|remission]] of sins. ^verse-11

**12**  But little [[#^note-12a|children]] are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a [[#^note-12b|respecter]] to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism! ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these must have gone to an endless hell. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither [[#^note-14a|faith]], hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell. ^verse-14

**15**  For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism. ^verse-15

**16**  Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having [[#^note-16a|authority]] from God; and I fear not what man can do; for [[#^note-16b|perfect]] [[#^note-16c|love]] [[#^note-16d|casteth out]] all fear. ^verse-16

**17**    And I am filled with [[#^note-17a|charity]], which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and [[#^note-17b|partakers]] of salvation. ^verse-17

**18**  For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is [[#^note-18a|unchangeable]] from [[#^note-18b|all]] eternity to all eternity. ^verse-18

**19**  Little [[#^note-19a|children]] cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of his [[#^note-19b|mercy]]. ^verse-19

**20**  And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the [[#^note-20a|atonement]] of him and the power of his redemption. ^verse-20

**21**  Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, [[#^note-21a|hell]], and an [[#^note-21b|endless]] torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the [[#^note-21c|judgment-seat]] of Christ. ^verse-21

**22**  For behold that all little children are [[#^note-22a|alive]] in Christ, and also all they that are without the [[#^note-22b|law]]. For the power of [[#^note-22c|redemption]] cometh on all them that have [[#^note-22d|no law]]; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing— ^verse-22

**23**  But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in [[#^note-23a|dead works]]. ^verse-23

**24**  Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for [[#^note-24a|repentance]] is unto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a broken law. ^verse-24

**25**  And the first fruits of [[#^note-25a|repentance]] is [[#^note-25b|baptism]]; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth [[#^note-25c|remission]] of sins; ^verse-25

**26**  And the remission of sins bringeth [[#^note-26a|meekness]], and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the [[#^note-26b|Holy Ghost]], which [[#^note-26c|Comforter]] [[#^note-26d|filleth]] with hope and perfect [[#^note-26e|love]], which love endureth by [[#^note-26f|diligence]] unto [[#^note-26g|prayer]], until the end shall come, when all the [[#^note-26h|saints]] shall dwell with God. ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon against the Lamanites. Behold, the [[#^note-27a|pride]] of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they should repent. ^verse-27

**28**  Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath [[#^note-28a|ceased]] [[#^note-28b|striving]] with them; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are [[#^note-28c|denying]] the Holy Ghost. ^verse-28

**29**  And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior himself. ^verse-29

**30**  Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you, or shall meet you again. Amen. ^verse-30
