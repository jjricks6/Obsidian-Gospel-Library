*Ammaron instructs Mormon concerning the sacred records—War commences between the Nephites and the Lamanites—The Three Nephites are taken away—Wickedness, unbelief, sorceries, and witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321-26.*

**1**  And now I, Mormon, make a [[#^note-1a|record]] of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call it the [[#^note-1b|Book of Mormon]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And about the time that [[#^note-2a|Ammaron]] hid up the records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I began to be [[#^note-2b|learned]] somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a [[#^note-2c|sober]] child, and art quick to observe; ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the [[#^note-3a|land Antum]], unto a hill which shall be called [[#^note-3b|Shim]]; and there have I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people. ^verse-3

**4**  And behold, ye shall take the [[#^note-4a|plates of Nephi]] unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and ye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye have observed concerning this people. ^verse-4

**5**  And I, Mormon, being a descendant of [[#^note-5a|Nephi]], (and my father's name was Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me. ^verse-5

**6**  And it came to pass that I, being eleven years old, was carried by my father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla. ^verse-6

**7**  The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings, and the people were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea. ^verse-7

**8**  And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the [[#^note-8a|Nephites]], who consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was between the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites. ^verse-8

**9**  Now the [[#^note-9a|Lamanites]] and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were called Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and Lamanites. ^verse-9

**10**  And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in the borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon. ^verse-10

**11**  And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand. And it came to pass that they did have in this same year a number of [[#^note-11a|battles]], in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them. ^verse-11

**12**  And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for the space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed. ^verse-12

**13**  But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his [[#^note-13a|beloved]] disciples, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people. ^verse-13

**14**  And there were no [[#^note-14a|gifts]] from the Lord, and the [[#^note-14b|Holy Ghost]] did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and [[#^note-14c|unbelief]]. ^verse-14

**15**  And I, being [[#^note-15a|fifteen]] years of age and being somewhat of a [[#^note-15b|sober]] mind, therefore I was [[#^note-15c|visited]] of the Lord, and [[#^note-15d|tasted]] and knew of the goodness of Jesus. ^verse-15

**16**  And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for behold they had [[#^note-16a|wilfully rebelled]] against their God; and the beloved disciples were [[#^note-16b|taken]] away out of the land, because of their iniquity. ^verse-16

**17**  But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to [[#^note-17a|preach]] unto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because of the hardness of their hearts the land was [[#^note-17b|cursed]] for their sake. ^verse-17

**18**  And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began to [[#^note-18a|hide]] up their [[#^note-18b|treasures]] in the earth; and they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could not hold them, nor retain them again. ^verse-18

**19**  And it came to pass that there were [[#^note-19a|sorceries]], and witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling of all the words of Abinadi, and also [[#^note-19b|Samuel the Lamanite]]. ^verse-19
