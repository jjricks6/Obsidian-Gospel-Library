*Mormon invites the Lamanites of the latter days to believe in Christ, accept His gospel, and be savedâ€”All who believe the Bible will also believe the Book of Mormon. About A.D. 385.*

**1**  And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the [[#^note-1a|remnant]] of this people who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and these are the words which I speak: ^verse-1

**2**  Know ye that ye are of the [[#^note-2a|house of Israel]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved. ^verse-3

**4**  Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that God shall [[#^note-4a|command]] you. ^verse-4

**5**  Know ye that ye must come to the [[#^note-5a|knowledge]] of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and [[#^note-5b|believe]] in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the [[#^note-5c|victory]] over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up. ^verse-5

**6**  And he bringeth to pass the [[#^note-6a|resurrection]] of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his [[#^note-6b|judgment-seat]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And he hath brought to pass the [[#^note-7a|redemption]] of the [[#^note-7b|world]], whereby he that is found [[#^note-7c|guiltless]] before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to [[#^note-7d|dwell]] in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the [[#^note-7e|choirs]] above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are [[#^note-7f|one God]], in a state of [[#^note-7g|happiness]] which hath no end. ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the [[#^note-8a|gospel]] of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles [[#^note-8b|from]] the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles [[#^note-8c|unto]] you. ^verse-8

**9**  For behold, [[#^note-9a|this]] is [[#^note-9b|written]] for the intent that ye may [[#^note-9c|believe]] that; and if [[#^note-9d|ye]] believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye believe this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among them. ^verse-9

**10**  And ye will also know that ye are a [[#^note-10a|remnant]] of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first [[#^note-10b|with water]], then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the [[#^note-10c|example]] of our Savior, according to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day of judgment. Amen. ^verse-10
