*1-4, John Whitmer is designated to keep the history of the Church and to write for the Prophet.*

**1**  Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular [[#^note-1a|history]], and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties. ^verse-1

**2**  Again, verily I say unto you that he can also [[#^note-2a|lift up]] his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient. ^verse-2

**3**  And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church [[#^note-3a|record]] and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the [[#^note-4a|Comforter]], to write these things. Even so. Amen. ^verse-4
