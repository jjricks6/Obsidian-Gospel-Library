*1-3, The Lord lays His hand upon Edward Partridge by the hand of Sidney Rigdon; 4-8, Every man who receives the gospel and the priesthood is to be called to go forth and preach.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord God, the [[#^note-1a|Mighty One]] of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my servant [[#^note-1b|Edward]], that you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump; ^verse-1

**2**  And I will lay my [[#^note-2a|hand]] upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the [[#^note-2b|Comforter]], which shall [[#^note-2c|teach]] you the peaceable things of the kingdom; ^verse-2

**3**  And you shall declare it with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna, [[#^note-3a|blessed]] be the name of the most high God. ^verse-3

**4**  And now this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men— ^verse-4

**5**  That as many as shall come before my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., embracing this calling and commandment, shall be [[#^note-5a|ordained]] and sent forth to [[#^note-5b|preach]] the everlasting gospel among the nations— ^verse-5

**6**  Crying repentance, saying: [[#^note-6a|Save]] yourselves from this untoward generation, and come forth out of the fire, hating even the [[#^note-6b|garments]] spotted with the flesh. ^verse-6

**7**  And this commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man which will [[#^note-7a|embrace]] it with [[#^note-7b|singleness]] of heart may be ordained and sent forth, even as I have spoken. ^verse-7

**8**  I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will [[#^note-8a|suddenly]] [[#^note-8b|come]] to my [[#^note-8c|temple]]. Even so. Amen. ^verse-8
