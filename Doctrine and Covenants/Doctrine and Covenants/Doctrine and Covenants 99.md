*1-8, John Murdock is called to proclaim the gospel, and those who receive him receive the Lord and will obtain mercy.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant John Murdockâ€”thou art [[#^note-1a|called]] to go into the eastern countries from house to house, from village to village, and from city to city, to proclaim mine everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, in the midst of [[#^note-1b|persecution]] and wickedness. ^verse-1

**2**  And who [[#^note-2a|receiveth]] you receiveth me; and you shall have power to declare my word in the [[#^note-2b|demonstration]] of my Holy Spirit. ^verse-2

**3**  And who receiveth you [[#^note-3a|as]] a little child, receiveth my [[#^note-3b|kingdom]]; and blessed are they, for they shall obtain [[#^note-3c|mercy]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And whoso rejecteth you shall be [[#^note-4a|rejected]] of my Father and his house; and you shall cleanse your [[#^note-4b|feet]] in the secret places by the way for a testimony against them. ^verse-4

**5**  And behold, and lo, I [[#^note-5a|come]] quickly to [[#^note-5b|judgment]], to convince all of their ungodly deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in the volume of the book. ^verse-5

**6**  And now, verily I say unto you, that it is not expedient that you should go until your children are [[#^note-6a|provided]] for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop of Zion. ^verse-6

**7**  And after a few years, if thou desirest of me, thou mayest go up also unto the goodly land, to possess thine [[#^note-7a|inheritance]]; ^verse-7

**8**  Otherwise thou shalt continue proclaiming my gospel [[#^note-8a|until]] thou be taken. Amen. ^verse-8
