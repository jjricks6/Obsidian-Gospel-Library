*1-4, The ends of the earth will inquire after the name of Joseph Smith; 5-7, All his perils and travails will give him experience and be for his good; 8-9, The Son of Man has descended below them all.*

**1**  The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy [[#^note-1a|name]], and fools shall have thee in [[#^note-1b|derision]], and hell shall rage against thee; ^verse-1

**2**  While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek [[#^note-2a|counsel]], and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand. ^verse-2

**3**  And thy [[#^note-3a|people]] shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors. ^verse-3

**4**  And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in [[#^note-4a|honor]]; and but for a small [[#^note-4b|moment]] and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce [[#^note-4c|lion]], because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever. ^verse-4

**5**  If thou art called to pass through [[#^note-5a|tribulation]]; if thou art in [[#^note-5b|perils]] among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea; ^verse-5

**6**  If thou art [[#^note-6a|accused]] with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to [[#^note-6b|prison]], and thine enemies prowl around thee like [[#^note-6c|wolves]] for the blood of the lamb; ^verse-6

**7**  And if thou shouldst be cast into the [[#^note-7a|pit]], or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the [[#^note-7b|deep]]; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to [[#^note-7c|hedge]] up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of [[#^note-7d|hell]] shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee [[#^note-7e|experience]], and shall be for thy good. ^verse-7

**8**  The [[#^note-8a|Son of Man]] hath [[#^note-8b|descended]] below them all. Art thou greater than he? ^verse-8

**9**  Therefore, [[#^note-9a|hold]] on thy way, and the priesthood shall [[#^note-9b|remain]] with thee; for their [[#^note-9c|bounds]] are set, they cannot pass. Thy [[#^note-9d|days]] are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, [[#^note-9e|fear not]] what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever. ^verse-9
