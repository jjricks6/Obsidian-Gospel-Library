*1-8, The Saints are chastened and afflicted because of their transgressions; 9-15, The Lord's indignation will fall upon the nations, but His people will be gathered and comforted; 16-21, Zion and her stakes will be established; 22-31, The nature of life during the Millennium is set forth; 32-42, The Saints will be blessed and rewarded then; 43-62, The parable of the nobleman and the olive trees signifies the troubles and eventual redemption of Zion; 63-75, The Saints are to continue gathering together; 76-80, The Lord established the Constitution of the United States; 81-101, The Saints are to importune for the redress of grievances, according to the parable of the woman and the unjust judge.*

**1**  Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted, and [[#^note-1a|persecuted]], and [[#^note-1b|cast out]] from the land of their inheritance— ^verse-1

**2**  I, the Lord, have suffered the [[#^note-2a|affliction]] to come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their [[#^note-2b|transgressions]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Yet I will own them, and they shall be [[#^note-3a|mine]] in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore, they must needs be [[#^note-4a|chastened]] and tried, even as [[#^note-4b|Abraham]], who was commanded to offer up his only son. ^verse-4

**5**  For all those who will not [[#^note-5a|endure]] chastening, but [[#^note-5b|deny]] me, cannot be sanctified. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and [[#^note-6a|contentions]], and [[#^note-6b|envyings]], and [[#^note-6c|strifes]], and [[#^note-6d|lustful]] and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances. ^verse-6

**7**  They were slow to [[#^note-7a|hearken]] unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble. ^verse-7

**8**  In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their [[#^note-8a|trouble]], of necessity they [[#^note-8b|feel]] after me. ^verse-8

**9**  Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with [[#^note-9a|compassion]] towards them. I will not utterly [[#^note-9b|cast]] them off; and in the day of [[#^note-9c|wrath]] I will remember mercy. ^verse-9

**10**  I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by a former commandment which I have given unto you, that I would let fall the [[#^note-10a|sword]] of mine indignation in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass. ^verse-10

**11**  Mine indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will I do when the cup of their iniquity is [[#^note-11a|full]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And in that day all who are found upon the [[#^note-12a|watch-tower]], or in other words, all mine Israel, shall be saved. ^verse-12

**13**  And they that have been scattered shall be [[#^note-13a|gathered]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And all they who have [[#^note-14a|mourned]] shall be comforted. ^verse-14

**15**  And all they who have given their [[#^note-15a|lives]] for my name shall be crowned. ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine [[#^note-16a|hands]]; be still and [[#^note-16b|know]] that I am God. ^verse-16

**17**  [[#^note-17a|Zion]] shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children are scattered. ^verse-17

**18**  They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and come to their [[#^note-18a|inheritances]], they and their children, with [[#^note-18b|songs]] of everlasting joy, to [[#^note-18c|build]] up the waste places of Zion— ^verse-18

**19**  And all these things that the prophets might be fulfilled. ^verse-19

**20**  And, behold, there is none other [[#^note-20a|place]] appointed than that which I have appointed; neither shall there be any other place appointed than that which I have appointed, for the work of the gathering of my saints— ^verse-20

**21**  Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called [[#^note-21a|stakes]], for the curtains or the strength of Zion. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should [[#^note-22a|gather]] together, and [[#^note-22b|stand]] in holy places; ^verse-22

**23**  And [[#^note-23a|prepare]] for the revelation which is to come, when the [[#^note-23b|veil]] of the covering of my temple, in my tabernacle, which hideth the earth, shall be taken off, and all flesh shall [[#^note-23c|see]] me together. ^verse-23

**24**  And every [[#^note-24a|corruptible]] thing, both of man, or of the beasts of the field, or of the fowls of the heavens, or of the fish of the sea, that dwells upon all the face of the earth, shall be [[#^note-24b|consumed]]; ^verse-24

**25**  And also that of element shall [[#^note-25a|melt]] with fervent heat; and all things shall become [[#^note-25b|new]], that my knowledge and [[#^note-25c|glory]] may dwell upon all the [[#^note-25d|earth]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And in that day the [[#^note-26a|enmity]] of man, and the [[#^note-26b|enmity]] of beasts, yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall cease from before my face. ^verse-26

**27**  And in that day [[#^note-27a|whatsoever]] any man shall ask, it shall be given unto him. ^verse-27

**28**  And in that day [[#^note-28a|Satan]] shall not have power to tempt any man. ^verse-28

**29**  And there shall be no [[#^note-29a|sorrow]] because there is no death. ^verse-29

**30**  In that day an [[#^note-30a|infant]] shall not die until he is old; and his life shall be as the age of a tree; ^verse-30

**31**  And when he dies he shall not sleep, that is to say in the earth, but shall be [[#^note-31a|changed]] in the twinkling of an eye, and shall be [[#^note-31b|caught up]], and his rest shall be glorious. ^verse-31

**32**  Yea, verily I say unto you, in that [[#^note-32a|day]] when the Lord shall come, he shall [[#^note-32b|reveal]] all things— ^verse-32

**33**  Things which have passed, and [[#^note-33a|hidden things]] which no man knew, things of the [[#^note-33b|earth]], by which it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof— ^verse-33

**34**  Things most precious, things that are above, and things that are beneath, things that are in the earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven. ^verse-34

**35**  And all they who suffer [[#^note-35a|persecution]] for my name, and endure in faith, though they are called to lay down their lives for my [[#^note-35b|sake]] yet shall they partake of all this glory. ^verse-35

**36**  Wherefore, [[#^note-36a|fear not]] even unto death; for in this world your [[#^note-36b|joy]] is not full, but in me your joy is full. ^verse-36

**37**  Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the [[#^note-37a|soul]], and for the life of the soul. ^verse-37

**38**  And [[#^note-38a|seek]] the face of the Lord always, that in [[#^note-38b|patience]] ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life. ^verse-38

**39**  When men are called unto mine [[#^note-39a|everlasting gospel]], and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the [[#^note-39b|salt]] of the earth and the savor of men; ^verse-39

**40**  They are called to be the savor of men; therefore, if that [[#^note-40a|salt]] of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. ^verse-40

**41**  Behold, here is wisdom concerning the children of Zion, even many, but not all; they were found transgressors, therefore they must needs be [[#^note-41a|chastened]]— ^verse-41

**42**  He that [[#^note-42a|exalteth]] himself shall be abased, and he that [[#^note-42b|abaseth]] himself shall be exalted. ^verse-42

**43**  And now, I will show unto you a parable, that you may know my will concerning the [[#^note-43a|redemption]] of Zion. ^verse-43

**44**  A certain [[#^note-44a|nobleman]] had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my [[#^note-44b|vineyard]], even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive trees; ^verse-44

**45**  And set [[#^note-45a|watchmen]] round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard. ^verse-45

**46**  Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded them, and planted the olive trees, and built a hedge round about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower. ^verse-46

**47**  And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say among themselves: And what need hath my lord of this tower? ^verse-47

**48**  And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace? ^verse-48

**49**  Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need of these things. ^verse-49

**50**  And while they were at variance one with another they became very [[#^note-50a|slothful]], and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord. ^verse-50

**51**  And the enemy came by night, and broke down the [[#^note-51a|hedge]]; and the servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olive trees. ^verse-51

**52**  Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the [[#^note-52a|vineyard]], called upon his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil? ^verse-52

**53**  Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a [[#^note-53a|watchman]] upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you? ^verse-53

**54**  And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my vineyard from the hands of the destroyer. ^verse-54

**55**  And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of his [[#^note-55a|servants]]: Go and gather together the residue of my servants, and take [[#^note-55b|all]] the strength of mine house, which are my warriors, my young men, and they that are of middle age also among all my servants, who are the strength of mine house, save those only whom I have appointed to tarry; ^verse-55

**56**  And go ye straightway unto the land of my vineyard, and redeem my vineyard; for it is mine; I have bought it with money. ^verse-56

**57**  Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the [[#^note-57a|walls]] of mine enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen. ^verse-57

**58**  And inasmuch as they gather together against you, [[#^note-58a|avenge]] me of mine enemies, that by and by I may come with the residue of mine house and possess the land. ^verse-58

**59**  And the servant said unto his lord: When shall these things be? ^verse-59

**60**  And he said unto his servant: When I will; go ye straightway, and do all things whatsoever I have commanded you; ^verse-60

**61**  And this shall be my seal and [[#^note-61a|blessing]] upon you—a faithful and [[#^note-61b|wise]] steward in the midst of mine house, a [[#^note-61c|ruler]] in my kingdom. ^verse-61

**62**  And his servant went straightway, and did all things whatsoever his lord commanded him; and [[#^note-62a|after]] many days all things were fulfilled. ^verse-62

**63**  Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are [[#^note-63a|willing]] to be guided in a right and proper way for their salvation— ^verse-63

**64**  That the work of the [[#^note-64a|gathering]] together of my saints may continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon [[#^note-64b|holy places]]; for the time of [[#^note-64c|harvest]] is come, and my word must needs be [[#^note-64d|fulfilled]]. ^verse-64

**65**  Therefore, I must gather together my people, according to the parable of the wheat and the [[#^note-65a|tares]], that the wheat may be secured in the garners to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial [[#^note-65b|glory]], when I shall come in the kingdom of my Father to reward every man according as his work shall be; ^verse-65

**66**  While the [[#^note-66a|tares]] shall be bound in bundles, and their bands made strong, that they may be [[#^note-66b|burned]] with unquenchable fire. ^verse-66

**67**  Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that they shall continue to gather together unto the places which I have appointed. ^verse-67

**68**  Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, let not your [[#^note-68a|gathering]] be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared before you. ^verse-68

**69**  And in order that all things be prepared before you, observe the commandment which I have given concerning these things— ^verse-69

**70**  Which saith, or teacheth, to [[#^note-70a|purchase]] all the lands with money, which can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land which I have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of the gathering of my saints; ^verse-70

**71**  All the land which can be purchased in Jackson county, and the counties round about, and leave the residue in mine hand. ^verse-71

**72**  Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in [[#^note-72a|haste]]; and observe to have all things prepared before you. ^verse-72

**73**  And let honorable men be appointed, even [[#^note-73a|wise]] men, and send them to purchase these lands. ^verse-73

**74**  And the churches in the [[#^note-74a|eastern]] countries, when they are built up, if they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion. ^verse-74

**75**  There is even now already in store sufficient, yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after my name, [[#^note-75a|willing]] to hearken to my voice. ^verse-75

**76**  And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over you— ^verse-76

**77**  According to the laws and [[#^note-77a|constitution]] of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the [[#^note-77b|rights]] and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; ^verse-77

**78**  That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral [[#^note-78a|agency]] which I have given unto him, that every man may be [[#^note-78b|accountable]] for his own sins in the day of [[#^note-78c|judgment]]. ^verse-78

**79**  Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in [[#^note-79a|bondage]] one to another. ^verse-79

**80**  And for this purpose have I established the [[#^note-80a|Constitution]] of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the [[#^note-80b|shedding]] of blood. ^verse-80

**81**  Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken them unto the [[#^note-81a|parable]] of the woman and the unjust judge, for men ought always to [[#^note-81b|pray]] and not to faint, which saith— ^verse-81

**82**  There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man. ^verse-82

**83**  And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying: Avenge me of mine adversary. ^verse-83

**84**  And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. ^verse-84

**85**  Thus will I liken the children of Zion. ^verse-85

**86**  Let them importune at the [[#^note-86a|feet]] of the judge; ^verse-86

**87**  And if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the governor; ^verse-87

**88**  And if the governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the president; ^verse-88

**89**  And if the president heed them not, then will the Lord arise and come forth out of his [[#^note-89a|hiding place]], and in his fury vex the nation; ^verse-89

**90**  And in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his time, will cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and [[#^note-90a|unjust]] [[#^note-90b|stewards]], and appoint them their portion among [[#^note-90c|hypocrites]], and [[#^note-90d|unbelievers]]; ^verse-90

**91**  Even in outer darkness, where there is [[#^note-91a|weeping]], and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-91

**92**  Pray ye, therefore, that their ears may be opened unto your cries, that I may be [[#^note-92a|merciful]] unto them, that these things may not come upon them. ^verse-92

**93**  What I have said unto you must needs be, that all men may be left without [[#^note-93a|excuse]]; ^verse-93

**94**  That wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have never [[#^note-94a|considered]]; ^verse-94

**95**  That I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my [[#^note-95a|strange act]], and perform my work, my strange work, that men may [[#^note-95b|discern]] between the righteous and the wicked, saith your God. ^verse-95

**96**  And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my commandment and my will that my servant Sidney Gilbert should sell my [[#^note-96a|storehouse]], which I have appointed unto my people, into the hands of mine enemies. ^verse-96

**97**  Let not that which I have appointed be polluted by mine enemies, by the consent of those who [[#^note-97a|call]] themselves after my name; ^verse-97

**98**  For this is a very sore and grievous sin against me, and against my people, in consequence of those things which I have decreed and which are soon to befall the nations. ^verse-98

**99**  Therefore, it is my will that my people should claim, and hold claim upon that which I have appointed unto them, though they should not be permitted to dwell thereon. ^verse-99

**100**  Nevertheless, I do not say they [[#^note-100a|shall]] not dwell thereon; for inasmuch as they bring forth fruit and works meet for my kingdom they shall dwell thereon. ^verse-100

**101**  They shall build, and another shall not [[#^note-101a|inherit]] it; they shall plant vineyards, and they shall eat the fruit thereof. Even so. Amen. ^verse-101
