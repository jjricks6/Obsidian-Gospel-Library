*1-4, The faithful become the sons of God through the Atonement; 5-9, The preaching of the gospel prepares the way for the Second Coming; 10-12, Prophecy comes by the power of the Holy Ghost.*

**1**  My son [[#^note-1a|Orson]], hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer; ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|light]] and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not; ^verse-2

**3**  Who so [[#^note-3a|loved]] the world that he [[#^note-3b|gave]] his own life, that as many as would believe might become the [[#^note-3c|sons]] of God. Wherefore you are my son; ^verse-3

**4**  And [[#^note-4a|blessed]] are you because you have believed; ^verse-4

**5**  And more blessed are you because you are [[#^note-5a|called]] of me to preach my gospel— ^verse-5

**6**  To lift up your voice as with the sound of a [[#^note-6a|trump]], both long and loud, and [[#^note-6b|cry]] repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, [[#^note-6c|preparing]] the way of the Lord for his [[#^note-6d|second coming]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the [[#^note-7a|time]] is soon at hand that I shall [[#^note-7b|come]] in a [[#^note-7c|cloud]] with power and great glory. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall be a [[#^note-8a|great day]] at the time of my coming, for all nations shall [[#^note-8b|tremble]]. ^verse-8

**9**  But before that great day shall come, the [[#^note-9a|sun]] shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, lift up your voice and [[#^note-10a|spare]] not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore [[#^note-10b|prophesy]], and it shall be given by the [[#^note-10c|power]] of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-10

**11**  And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come— ^verse-11

**12**  And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come [[#^note-12a|quickly]]. I am your [[#^note-12b|Lord]] and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen. ^verse-12
