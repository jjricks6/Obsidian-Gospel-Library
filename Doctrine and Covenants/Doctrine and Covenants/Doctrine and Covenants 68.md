*1-5, The words of the elders when moved upon by the Holy Ghost are scripture; 6-12, Elders are to preach and baptize, and signs will follow true believers; 13-24, The firstborn among the sons of Aaron may serve as the Presiding Bishop (that is, hold the keys of presidency as a bishop) under the direction of the First Presidency; 25-28, Parents are commanded to teach the gospel to their children; 29-35, The Saints are to observe the Sabbath, labor diligently, and pray.*

**1**  My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the [[#^note-1a|everlasting gospel]], by the [[#^note-1b|Spirit]] of the living God, from people to people, and from land to land, in the [[#^note-1c|congregations]] of the wicked, in their [[#^note-1d|synagogues]], reasoning with and [[#^note-1e|expounding]] all scriptures unto them. ^verse-1

**2**  And, behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto all those who were ordained unto this priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto them to go forth— ^verse-2

**3**  And this is the [[#^note-3a|ensample]] unto them, that they shall [[#^note-3b|speak]] as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost. ^verse-3

**4**  And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the [[#^note-4a|Holy Ghost]] shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the [[#^note-4b|power]] of God unto salvation. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, be of good [[#^note-6a|cheer]], and do not [[#^note-6b|fear]], for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I [[#^note-6c|was]], that I am, and that I am to come. ^verse-6

**7**  This is the word of the Lord unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant [[#^note-7a|William E. McLellin]], and unto all the faithful elders of my church— ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Go]] ye into all the world, [[#^note-8b|preach]] the gospel to every [[#^note-8c|creature]], acting in the [[#^note-8d|authority]] which I have given you, [[#^note-8e|baptizing]] in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-8

**9**  And [[#^note-9a|he]] that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be [[#^note-9b|damned]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And he that believeth shall be blest with [[#^note-10a|signs]] following, even as it is written. ^verse-10

**11**  And unto you it shall be given to know the signs of the [[#^note-11a|times]], and the [[#^note-11b|signs]] of the coming of the Son of Man; ^verse-11

**12**  And of as many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to [[#^note-12a|seal]] them up unto eternal life. Amen. ^verse-12

**13**  And now, concerning the items in addition to the [[#^note-13a|covenants]] and commandments, they are these— ^verse-13

**14**  There remain hereafter, in the due time of the Lord, other [[#^note-14a|bishops]] to be set apart unto the [[#^note-14b|church]], to minister even according to the first; ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore they shall be [[#^note-15a|high priests]] who are worthy, and they shall be appointed by the [[#^note-15b|First Presidency]] of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they be literal descendants of [[#^note-15c|Aaron]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And if they be literal descendants of [[#^note-16a|Aaron]] they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the [[#^note-16b|firstborn]] among the sons of Aaron; ^verse-16

**17**  For the firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood, and the [[#^note-17a|keys]] or authority of the same. ^verse-17

**18**  No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a [[#^note-18a|literal descendant]] and the firstborn of Aaron. ^verse-18

**19**  But, as a [[#^note-19a|high priest]] of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of [[#^note-19b|bishop]] when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power, under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood. ^verse-19

**20**  And a literal descendant of Aaron, also, must be designated by this Presidency, and found worthy, and [[#^note-20a|anointed]], and ordained under the hands of this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their priesthood. ^verse-20

**21**  But, by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending from father to son, they may claim their [[#^note-21a|anointing]] if at any time they can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the [[#^note-21b|hands]] of the above named Presidency. ^verse-21

**22**  And again, no bishop or high priest who shall be set apart for this ministry shall be tried or [[#^note-22a|condemned]] for any crime, save it be before the [[#^note-22b|First Presidency]] of the church; ^verse-22

**23**  And inasmuch as he is found [[#^note-23a|guilty]] before this Presidency, by testimony that cannot be impeached, he shall be condemned; ^verse-23

**24**  And if he repent he shall be [[#^note-24a|forgiven]], according to the covenants and [[#^note-24b|commandments]] of the church. ^verse-24

**25**  And again, inasmuch as [[#^note-25a|parents]] have children in Zion, or in any of her [[#^note-25b|stakes]] which are organized, that [[#^note-25c|teach]] them not to understand the [[#^note-25d|doctrine]] of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when [[#^note-25e|eight]] years old, the [[#^note-25f|sin]] be upon the heads of the parents. ^verse-25

**26**  For this shall be a law unto the [[#^note-26a|inhabitants]] of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized. ^verse-26

**27**  And their children shall be [[#^note-27a|baptized]] for the [[#^note-27b|remission]] of their sins when [[#^note-27c|eight]] years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. ^verse-27

**28**  And they shall also [[#^note-28a|teach]] their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord. ^verse-28

**29**  And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the [[#^note-29a|Sabbath]] day to keep it holy. ^verse-29

**30**  And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their [[#^note-30a|labors]], inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the [[#^note-30b|idler]] shall be had in remembrance before the Lord. ^verse-30

**31**  Now, I, the Lord, am not well [[#^note-31a|pleased]] with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are [[#^note-31b|idlers]] among them; and their [[#^note-31c|children]] are also growing up in [[#^note-31d|wickedness]]; they also [[#^note-31e|seek]] not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of [[#^note-31f|greediness]]. ^verse-31

**32**  These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them; wherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery [[#^note-32a|carry]] these sayings unto the land of Zion. ^verse-32

**33**  And a commandment I give unto them—that he that observeth not his [[#^note-33a|prayers]] before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in [[#^note-33b|remembrance]] before the judge of my people. ^verse-33

**34**  These sayings are [[#^note-34a|true]] and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, neither [[#^note-34b|take]] therefrom. ^verse-34

**35**  Behold, I am [[#^note-35a|Alpha and Omega]], and I [[#^note-35b|come]] quickly. Amen. ^verse-35
