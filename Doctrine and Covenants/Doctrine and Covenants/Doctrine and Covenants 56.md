*1-2, The Saints must take up their cross and follow the Lord to gain salvation; 3-13, The Lord commands and revokes, and the disobedient are cast off; 14-17, Wo unto the rich who will not help the poor, and wo unto the poor whose hearts are not broken; 18-20, Blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, for they will inherit the earth.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye people who [[#^note-1a|profess]] my name, saith the Lord your God; for behold, mine anger is [[#^note-1b|kindled]] against the rebellious, and they shall know mine arm and mine indignation, in the day of [[#^note-1c|visitation]] and of wrath upon the nations. ^verse-1

**2**  And he that will not take up his [[#^note-2a|cross]] and [[#^note-2b|follow]] me, and keep my commandments, the same shall not be saved. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I, the Lord, command; and he that will not [[#^note-3a|obey]] shall be [[#^note-3b|cut off]] in mine own due time, after I have commanded and the commandment is broken. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore I, the Lord, command and [[#^note-4a|revoke]], as it seemeth me good; and all this to be answered upon the heads of the [[#^note-4b|rebellious]], saith the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, I revoke the commandment which was given unto my servants [[#^note-5a|Thomas B. Marsh]] and Ezra Thayre, and give a new commandment unto my servant Thomas, that he shall take up his journey speedily to the land of Missouri, and my servant Selah J. Griffin shall also go with him. ^verse-5

**6**  For behold, I revoke the commandment which was given unto my servants [[#^note-6a|Selah J. Griffin]] and Newel Knight, in consequence of the [[#^note-6b|stiffneckedness]] of my people which are in Thompson, and their rebellions. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, let my servant Newel Knight remain with them; and as many as will go may go, that are contrite before me, and be led by him to the land which I have appointed. ^verse-7

**8**  And again, verily I say unto you, that my servant Ezra Thayre must repent of his [[#^note-8a|pride]], and of his [[#^note-8b|selfishness]], and obey the former commandment which I have given him concerning the place upon which he lives. ^verse-8

**9**  And if he will do this, as there shall be no divisions made upon the land, he shall be appointed still to go to the land of Missouri; ^verse-9

**10**  Otherwise he shall receive the [[#^note-10a|money]] which he has paid, and shall leave the place, and shall be [[#^note-10b|cut off]] out of my church, saith the Lord God of hosts; ^verse-10

**11**  And though the heaven and the earth [[#^note-11a|pass away]], these words shall not pass away, but shall be fulfilled. ^verse-11

**12**  And if my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., must needs pay the money, behold, I, the Lord, will pay it unto him again in the land of Missouri, that those of whom he shall receive may be rewarded again according to that which they do; ^verse-12

**13**  For according to that which they do they shall receive, even in lands for their inheritance. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my peopleâ€”you have many things to do and to repent of; for behold, your [[#^note-14a|sins]] have come up unto me, and are not [[#^note-14b|pardoned]], because you seek to [[#^note-14c|counsel]] in your own ways. ^verse-14

**15**  And your hearts are not satisfied. And ye obey not the truth, but have [[#^note-15a|pleasure]] in unrighteousness. ^verse-15

**16**  Wo unto you [[#^note-16a|rich]] men, that will not [[#^note-16b|give]] your substance to the [[#^note-16c|poor]], for your [[#^note-16d|riches]] will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The [[#^note-16e|harvest]] is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved! ^verse-16

**17**  Wo unto you [[#^note-17a|poor]] men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of [[#^note-17b|greediness]], and who will not [[#^note-17c|labor]] with your own hands! ^verse-17

**18**  But blessed are the [[#^note-18a|poor]] who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are [[#^note-18b|contrite]], for they shall see the [[#^note-18c|kingdom]] of God coming in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the [[#^note-18d|earth]] shall be theirs. ^verse-18

**19**  For behold, the Lord shall come, and his [[#^note-19a|recompense]] shall be with him, and he shall [[#^note-19b|reward]] every man, and the poor shall rejoice; ^verse-19

**20**  And their generations shall [[#^note-20a|inherit]] the earth from generation to generation, forever and ever. And now I make an end of speaking unto you. Even so. Amen. ^verse-20
