*1-5, Christ is our advocate with the Father; 6-10, The gospel is a messenger to prepare the way before the Lord; 11-15, Enoch and his brethren were received by the Lord unto Himself; 16-23, Christ revealed signs of His coming as given on the Mount of Olives; 24-38, The gospel will be restored, the times of the Gentiles will be fulfilled, and a desolating sickness will cover the land; 39-47, Signs, wonders, and the Resurrection are to attend the Second Coming; 48-53, Christ will stand on the Mount of Olives, and the Jews will see the wounds in His hands and feet; 54-59, The Lord will reign during the Millennium; 60-62, The Prophet is instructed to begin the translation of the New Testament, through which important information will be made known; 63-75, The Saints are commanded to gather and build the New Jerusalem, to which people from all nations will come.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye people of my [[#^note-1a|church]], to whom the [[#^note-1b|kingdom]] has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who [[#^note-1c|made]] the heavens and all the [[#^note-1d|hosts]] thereof, and by whom all things were made which [[#^note-1e|live]], and move, and have a being. ^verse-1

**2**  And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest [[#^note-2a|death]] shall overtake you; in an [[#^note-2b|hour]] when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the [[#^note-2c|harvest]] ended, and your souls not saved. ^verse-2

**3**  Listen to him who is the [[#^note-3a|advocate]] with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him— ^verse-3

**4**  Saying: Father, behold the [[#^note-4a|sufferings]] and [[#^note-4b|death]] of him who did no [[#^note-4c|sin]], in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be [[#^note-4d|glorified]]; ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, Father, spare these my [[#^note-5a|brethren]] that [[#^note-5b|believe]] on my name, that they may come unto me and have [[#^note-5c|everlasting life]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called [[#^note-6a|today]], and harden not your hearts; ^verse-6

**7**  For verily I say unto you that I am [[#^note-7a|Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, the [[#^note-7b|light]] and the life of the world—a light that shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not. ^verse-7

**8**  I came unto mine own, and mine own [[#^note-8a|received me not]]; but unto as many as received me gave I [[#^note-8b|power]] to do many [[#^note-8c|miracles]], and to become the [[#^note-8d|sons]] of God; and even unto them that [[#^note-8e|believed]] on my name gave I power to obtain eternal [[#^note-8f|life]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And even so I have sent mine [[#^note-9a|everlasting]] [[#^note-9b|covenant]] into the world, to be a [[#^note-9c|light]] to the world, and to be a [[#^note-9d|standard]] for my people, and for the [[#^note-9e|Gentiles]] to seek to it, and to be a [[#^note-9f|messenger]] before my face to prepare the way before me. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will [[#^note-10a|reason]] as with men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my [[#^note-11a|wisdom]]—the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of [[#^note-11b|Enoch]], and his brethren, ^verse-11

**12**  Who were [[#^note-12a|separated]] from the earth, and were received unto myself—a [[#^note-12b|city]] reserved until a [[#^note-12c|day]] of righteousness shall come—a day which was sought for by all holy men, and they found it not because of wickedness and abominations; ^verse-12

**13**  And confessed they were [[#^note-13a|strangers]] and pilgrims on the earth; ^verse-13

**14**  But obtained a [[#^note-14a|promise]] that they should find it and see it in their flesh. ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore, hearken and I will reason with you, and I will [[#^note-15a|speak]] unto you and prophesy, as unto men in days of old. ^verse-15

**16**  And I will show it plainly as I showed it unto my [[#^note-16a|disciples]] as I stood before them in the flesh, and spake unto them, saying: As ye have asked of me concerning the [[#^note-16b|signs]] of my coming, in the day when I shall come in my [[#^note-16c|glory]] in the clouds of heaven, to fulfil the promises that I have made unto your fathers, ^verse-16

**17**  For as ye have looked upon the long [[#^note-17a|absence]] of your [[#^note-17b|spirits]] from your bodies to be a bondage, I will show unto you how the day of redemption shall come, and also the [[#^note-17c|restoration]] of the [[#^note-17d|scattered]] Israel. ^verse-17

**18**  And now ye [[#^note-18a|behold]] this temple which is in Jerusalem, which ye call the house of God, and your enemies say that this house shall never fall. ^verse-18

**19**  But, verily I say unto you, that [[#^note-19a|desolation]] shall come upon this generation as a thief in the night, and this people shall be destroyed and [[#^note-19b|scattered]] among all nations. ^verse-19

**20**  And this [[#^note-20a|temple]] which ye now see shall be thrown down that there shall not be left one stone upon another. ^verse-20

**21**  And it shall come to pass, that this [[#^note-21a|generation]] of Jews shall not pass away until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come [[#^note-21b|to pass]]. ^verse-21

**22**  Ye say that ye know that the [[#^note-22a|end]] of the world cometh; ye say also that ye know that the heavens and the earth shall pass away; ^verse-22

**23**  And in this ye say truly, for so it is; but these things which I have told you shall not [[#^note-23a|pass away]] until all shall be fulfilled. ^verse-23

**24**  And this I have told you concerning Jerusalem; and when that day shall come, shall a remnant be [[#^note-24a|scattered]] among all [[#^note-24b|nations]]; ^verse-24

**25**  But they shall be [[#^note-25a|gathered]] again; but they shall remain until the times of the [[#^note-25b|Gentiles]] be fulfilled. ^verse-25

**26**  And in [[#^note-26a|that day]] shall be heard of [[#^note-26b|wars]] and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall [[#^note-26c|fail]] them, and they shall say that Christ [[#^note-26d|delayeth]] his coming until the end of the earth. ^verse-26

**27**  And the [[#^note-27a|love]] of men shall wax cold, and [[#^note-27b|iniquity]] shall abound. ^verse-27

**28**  And when the times of the [[#^note-28a|Gentiles]] is come in, a [[#^note-28b|light]] shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my [[#^note-28c|gospel]]; ^verse-28

**29**  But they [[#^note-29a|receive]] it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their [[#^note-29b|hearts]] from me because of the [[#^note-29c|precepts]] of men. ^verse-29

**30**  And in that generation shall the [[#^note-30a|times]] of the Gentiles be fulfilled. ^verse-30

**31**  And there shall be men standing in that [[#^note-31a|generation]], that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing [[#^note-31b|scourge]]; for a desolating [[#^note-31c|sickness]] shall cover the land. ^verse-31

**32**  But my disciples shall [[#^note-32a|stand]] in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and [[#^note-32b|curse]] God and die. ^verse-32

**33**  And there shall be [[#^note-33a|earthquakes]] also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the [[#^note-33b|sword]], one against another, and they will kill one another. ^verse-33

**34**  And now, when I the Lord had spoken these words unto my disciples, they were troubled. ^verse-34

**35**  And I said unto them: Be not [[#^note-35a|troubled]], for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled. ^verse-35

**36**  And when the [[#^note-36a|light]] shall begin to break forth, it shall be with them like unto a parable which I will show you— ^verse-36

**37**  Ye look and behold the [[#^note-37a|fig trees]], and ye see them with your eyes, and ye say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that summer is now nigh at hand; ^verse-37

**38**  Even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall they know that the hour is nigh. ^verse-38

**39**  And it shall come to pass that he that [[#^note-39a|feareth]] me shall be [[#^note-39b|looking]] forth for the great [[#^note-39c|day]] of the Lord to [[#^note-39d|come]], even for the [[#^note-39e|signs]] of the coming of the [[#^note-39f|Son of Man]]. ^verse-39

**40**  And they shall see signs and [[#^note-40a|wonders]], for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath. ^verse-40

**41**  And they shall behold blood, and [[#^note-41a|fire]], and vapors of [[#^note-41b|smoke]]. ^verse-41

**42**  And before the day of the Lord shall come, the [[#^note-42a|sun]] shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood, and the stars fall from heaven. ^verse-42

**43**  And the [[#^note-43a|remnant]] shall be gathered unto this place; ^verse-43

**44**  And then they shall look for me, and, behold, I will come; and they shall see me in the [[#^note-44a|clouds]] of heaven, clothed with power and great [[#^note-44b|glory]]; with all the holy angels; and he that [[#^note-44c|watches]] not for me shall be cut off. ^verse-44

**45**  But before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an angel shall sound his [[#^note-45a|trump]], and the [[#^note-45b|saints]] that have slept shall [[#^note-45c|come]] forth to meet me in the [[#^note-45d|cloud]]. ^verse-45

**46**  Wherefore, if ye have slept in [[#^note-46a|peace]] blessed are you; for as you now behold me and know that I am, even so shall ye [[#^note-46b|come]] unto me and your souls shall [[#^note-46c|live]], and your redemption shall be perfected; and the saints shall come forth from the [[#^note-46d|four]] quarters of the earth. ^verse-46

**47**  Then shall the [[#^note-47a|arm]] of the Lord fall upon the nations. ^verse-47

**48**  And then shall the Lord set his foot upon this [[#^note-48a|mount]], and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth shall [[#^note-48b|tremble]], and reel to and fro, and the [[#^note-48c|heavens]] also [[#^note-48d|shall shake]]. ^verse-48

**49**  And the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it; and the nations of the earth shall [[#^note-49a|mourn]], and they that have [[#^note-49b|laughed]] shall see their [[#^note-49c|folly]]. ^verse-49

**50**  And calamity shall cover the [[#^note-50a|mocker]], and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and [[#^note-50b|cast]] into the [[#^note-50c|fire]]. ^verse-50

**51**  And then shall the [[#^note-51a|Jews]] [[#^note-51b|look]] upon me and say: What are these [[#^note-51c|wounds]] in thine hands and in thy feet? ^verse-51

**52**  Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was [[#^note-52a|wounded]] in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was [[#^note-52b|crucified]]. I am the [[#^note-52c|Son of God]]. ^verse-52

**53**  And then shall they [[#^note-53a|weep]] because of their iniquities; then shall they [[#^note-53b|lament]] because they [[#^note-53c|persecuted]] their [[#^note-53d|king]]. ^verse-53

**54**  And then shall the [[#^note-54a|heathen]] nations be [[#^note-54b|redeemed]], and they that [[#^note-54c|knew no]] [[#^note-54d|law]] shall have part in the [[#^note-54e|first]] [[#^note-54f|resurrection]]; and it shall be [[#^note-54g|tolerable]] for them. ^verse-54

**55**  And [[#^note-55a|Satan]] shall be [[#^note-55b|bound]], that he shall have no place in the hearts of the children of men. ^verse-55

**56**    And at that day, when I shall come in my [[#^note-56a|glory]], shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten [[#^note-56b|virgins]]. ^verse-56

**57**  For they that are wise and have received the [[#^note-57a|truth]], and have taken the Holy Spirit for their [[#^note-57b|guide]], and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the [[#^note-57c|fire]], but shall abide the day. ^verse-57

**58**  And the [[#^note-58a|earth]] shall be given unto them for an [[#^note-58b|inheritance]]; and they shall [[#^note-58c|multiply]] and wax strong, and their [[#^note-58d|children]] shall [[#^note-58e|grow up]] without [[#^note-58f|sin]] unto [[#^note-58g|salvation]]. ^verse-58

**59**  For the Lord shall be in their [[#^note-59a|midst]], and his [[#^note-59b|glory]] shall be upon them, and he will be their [[#^note-59c|king]] and their [[#^note-59d|lawgiver]]. ^verse-59

**60**  And now, behold, I say unto you, it shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the [[#^note-60a|New Testament]] be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known; ^verse-60

**61**  Wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it, that ye may be prepared for the things to come. ^verse-61

**62**  For verily I say unto you, that great things await you; ^verse-62

**63**  Ye hear of [[#^note-63a|wars]] in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your [[#^note-63b|doors]], and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in your own lands. ^verse-63

**64**  Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the [[#^note-64a|eastern]] lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me. ^verse-64

**65**  And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that ye may [[#^note-65a|purchase]] an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed unto you. ^verse-65

**66**  And it shall be called the [[#^note-66a|New Jerusalem]], a [[#^note-66b|land]] of [[#^note-66c|peace]], a city of [[#^note-66d|refuge]], a place of [[#^note-66e|safety]] for the saints of the Most High God; ^verse-66

**67**  And the [[#^note-67a|glory]] of the Lord shall be there, and the [[#^note-67b|terror]] of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion. ^verse-67

**68**  And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his [[#^note-68a|neighbor]] must needs flee unto [[#^note-68b|Zion]] for safety. ^verse-68

**69**  And there shall be [[#^note-69a|gathered]] unto it out of every [[#^note-69b|nation]] under heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at [[#^note-69c|war]] one with another. ^verse-69

**70**  And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are [[#^note-70a|terrible]]; wherefore we cannot stand. ^verse-70

**71**  And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with [[#^note-71a|songs]] of everlasting [[#^note-71b|joy]]. ^verse-71

**72**  And now I say unto you, keep these things from going abroad unto the world until it is expedient in me, that ye may accomplish this work in the eyes of the people, and in the eyes of your enemies, that they may not know your works until ye have accomplished the thing which I have commanded you; ^verse-72

**73**  That when they shall know it, that they may consider these things. ^verse-73

**74**  For when the Lord shall appear he shall be [[#^note-74a|terrible]] unto them, that fear may seize upon them, and they shall stand afar off and tremble. ^verse-74

**75**  And all nations shall be afraid because of the terror of the Lord, and the power of his might. Even so. Amen. ^verse-75
