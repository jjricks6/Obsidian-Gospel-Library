*1-6, Christ created all things; 7-8, He is in the midst of His Saints, who will soon see Him; 9-12, All flesh is corrupted before Him; 13-22, He has reserved a land of promise for His Saints in time and in eternity; 23-27, The Saints are commanded to be one and esteem each other as brethren; 28-29, Wars are predicted; 30-33, The Saints are to be given power from on high and to go forth among all nations; 34-42, The Church is commanded to care for the poor and needy and to seek the riches of eternity.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great [[#^note-1a|I Am]], Alpha and Omega, the [[#^note-1b|beginning]] and the end, the [[#^note-1c|same]] which looked upon the [[#^note-1d|wide]] expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic [[#^note-1e|hosts]] of heaven, [[#^note-1f|before]] the world was [[#^note-1g|made]]; ^verse-1

**2**  The same which [[#^note-2a|knoweth]] [[#^note-2b|all]] things, for all things are [[#^note-2c|present]] before mine eyes; ^verse-2

**3**  I am the same which [[#^note-3a|spake]], and the world was made, and all things came by me. ^verse-3

**4**  I am the same which have taken the [[#^note-4a|Zion]] of [[#^note-4b|Enoch]] into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have [[#^note-4c|believed]] in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the [[#^note-4d|blood]] which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them. ^verse-4

**5**  But behold, the residue of the [[#^note-5a|wicked]] have I kept in [[#^note-5b|chains]] of darkness until the [[#^note-5c|judgment]] of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth; ^verse-5

**6**  And even so will I cause the wicked to be kept, that will not hear my voice but [[#^note-6a|harden]] their hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is their doom. ^verse-6

**7**  But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine [[#^note-7a|eyes]] are upon you. I am in your [[#^note-7b|midst]] and ye cannot [[#^note-7c|see]] me; ^verse-7

**8**  But the day soon cometh that ye shall [[#^note-8a|see]] me, and know that I am; for the [[#^note-8b|veil]] of darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not [[#^note-8c|purified]] shall not [[#^note-8d|abide]] the day. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the [[#^note-9a|kingdom]] is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome. ^verse-9

**10**  Verily I say unto you, ye are [[#^note-10a|clean]], but not all; and there is none else with whom I am well [[#^note-10b|pleased]]; ^verse-10

**11**  For all [[#^note-11a|flesh]] is corrupted before me; and the powers of [[#^note-11b|darkness]] prevail upon the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts of heaven— ^verse-11

**12**  Which causeth [[#^note-12a|silence]] to reign, and all eternity is [[#^note-12b|pained]], and the [[#^note-12c|angels]] are waiting the great command to [[#^note-12d|reap]] down the earth, to [[#^note-12e|gather]] the [[#^note-12f|tares]] that they may be [[#^note-12g|burned]]; and, behold, the enemy is combined. ^verse-12

**13**  And now I show unto you a mystery, a thing which is had in secret chambers, to bring to pass even your [[#^note-13a|destruction]] in process of time, and ye knew it not; ^verse-13

**14**  But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are [[#^note-14a|guilty]] before me, but I will be merciful unto your [[#^note-14b|weakness]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore, be ye [[#^note-15a|strong]] from henceforth; [[#^note-15b|fear not]], for the kingdom is yours. ^verse-15

**16**  And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your [[#^note-16a|prayers]], and the [[#^note-16b|poor]] have complained before me, and the [[#^note-16c|rich]] have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no [[#^note-16d|respecter]] of persons. ^verse-16

**17**  And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my [[#^note-17a|footstool]], wherefore, again I will stand upon it. ^verse-17

**18**  And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of [[#^note-18a|promise]], a land [[#^note-18b|flowing]] with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no [[#^note-18c|curse]] when the Lord cometh; ^verse-18

**19**  And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts. ^verse-19

**20**  And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your [[#^note-20a|inheritance]], and for the inheritance of your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away. ^verse-20

**21**  But, verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no [[#^note-21a|king]] nor ruler, for I will be your king and watch over you. ^verse-21

**22**  Wherefore, hear my voice and [[#^note-22a|follow]] me, and you shall be a [[#^note-22b|free]] people, and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your [[#^note-22c|lawgiver]], and what can stay my hand? ^verse-22

**23**  But, verily I say unto you, [[#^note-23a|teach]] one another according to the office wherewith I have appointed you; ^verse-23

**24**  And let every man [[#^note-24a|esteem]] his brother as himself, and practice [[#^note-24b|virtue]] and holiness before me. ^verse-24

**25**  And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his [[#^note-25a|brother]] as himself. ^verse-25

**26**  For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there—and looketh upon his sons and saith I am [[#^note-26a|just]]? ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be [[#^note-27a|one]]; and if ye are not one ye are not mine. ^verse-27

**28**  And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your [[#^note-28a|lives]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Ye hear of [[#^note-29a|wars]] in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land. ^verse-29

**30**  I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, [[#^note-30a|treasure]] up [[#^note-30b|wisdom]] in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear. ^verse-30

**31**  And that ye might escape the power of the [[#^note-31a|enemy]], and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without [[#^note-31b|spot]] and blameless— ^verse-31

**32**  Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the [[#^note-32a|commandment]] that ye should go to the [[#^note-32b|Ohio]]; and there I will give unto you my [[#^note-32c|law]]; and there you shall be [[#^note-32d|endowed]] with power from on high; ^verse-32

**33**  And from thence, whosoever I will shall [[#^note-33a|go forth]] among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be [[#^note-33b|saved]], and I will [[#^note-33c|lead]] them whithersoever I will, and no power shall [[#^note-33d|stay]] my hand. ^verse-33

**34**  And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be [[#^note-34a|appointed]], and they shall be appointed by the [[#^note-34b|voice]] of the church; ^verse-34

**35**  And they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their [[#^note-35a|relief]] that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I have commanded them; ^verse-35

**36**  And this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this [[#^note-36a|church]]. ^verse-36

**37**  And they that have farms that cannot be sold, let them be left or rented as seemeth them good. ^verse-37

**38**  See that all things are preserved; and when men are [[#^note-38a|endowed]] with power from on high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church. ^verse-38

**39**  And if ye seek the [[#^note-39a|riches]] which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the [[#^note-39b|riches]]t of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of [[#^note-39c|pride]], lest ye become as the [[#^note-39d|Nephites]] of old. ^verse-39

**40**  And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the [[#^note-40a|labor]] of his [[#^note-40b|hands]], to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded. ^verse-40

**41**  And let your [[#^note-41a|preaching]] be the [[#^note-41b|warning]] voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in [[#^note-41c|meekness]]. ^verse-41

**42**  And go ye [[#^note-42a|out]] from among the [[#^note-42b|wicked]]. Save yourselves. Be ye [[#^note-42c|clean]] that bear the vessels of the Lord. Even so. Amen. ^verse-42
