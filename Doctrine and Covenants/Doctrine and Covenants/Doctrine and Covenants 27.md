*1-4, The emblems to be used in partaking of the sacrament are set forth; 5-14, Christ and His servants from all dispensations are to partake of the sacrament; 15-18, Put on the whole armor of God.*

**1**  Listen to the [[#^note-1a|voice]] of Jesus Christ, your Lord, your God, and your Redeemer, whose word is [[#^note-1b|quick]] and powerful. ^verse-1

**2**  For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall [[#^note-2a|eat]] or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my [[#^note-2b|glory]]—[[#^note-2c|remembering]] unto the Father my [[#^note-2d|body]] which was laid down for you, and my [[#^note-2e|blood]] which was shed for the [[#^note-2f|remission]] of your sins. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, that you shall not purchase [[#^note-3a|wine]] neither strong drink of your enemies; ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, you shall partake of none except it is made [[#^note-4a|new]] among you; yea, in this my Father's kingdom which shall be built up on the earth. ^verse-4

**5**    Behold, this is wisdom in me; wherefore, marvel not, for the hour cometh that I will [[#^note-5a|drink]] of the fruit of the [[#^note-5b|vine]] with you on the earth, and with [[#^note-5c|Moroni]], whom I have sent unto you to reveal the Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting gospel, to whom I have committed the keys of the [[#^note-5d|record]] of the [[#^note-5e|stick]] of [[#^note-5f|Ephraim]]; ^verse-5

**6**  And also with [[#^note-6a|Elias]], to whom I have committed the keys of bringing to pass the restoration of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began, concerning the last days; ^verse-6

**7**  And also John the son of Zacharias, which Zacharias he [[#^note-7a|(Elias)]] visited and gave promise that he should have a son, and his name should be [[#^note-7b|John]], and he should be filled with the spirit of Elias; ^verse-7

**8**  Which John I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto the first [[#^note-8a|priesthood]] which you have received, that you might be called and [[#^note-8b|ordained]] even as [[#^note-8c|Aaron]]; ^verse-8

**9**  And also [[#^note-9a|Elijah]], unto whom I have committed the keys of the power of turning the hearts of the [[#^note-9b|fathers]] to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, that the whole earth may not be smitten with a [[#^note-9c|curse]]; ^verse-9

**10**  And also with Joseph and [[#^note-10a|Jacob]], and [[#^note-10b|Isaac]], and Abraham, your [[#^note-10c|fathers]], by whom the [[#^note-10d|promises]] remain; ^verse-10

**11**  And also with Michael, or [[#^note-11a|Adam]], the father of all, the prince of all, the [[#^note-11b|ancient]] of days; ^verse-11

**12**    And also with Peter, and James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have [[#^note-12a|ordained]] you and confirmed you to be [[#^note-12b|apostles]], and especial [[#^note-12c|witnesses]] of my [[#^note-12d|name]], and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which I revealed unto them; ^verse-12

**13**    Unto whom I have [[#^note-13a|committed]] the [[#^note-13b|keys]] of my kingdom, and a [[#^note-13c|dispensation]] of the [[#^note-13d|gospel]] for the [[#^note-13e|last times]]; and for the [[#^note-13f|fulness]] of times, in the which I will gather together in [[#^note-13g|one]] all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; ^verse-13

**14**  And also with all those whom my Father hath [[#^note-14a|given]] me out of the world. ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore, [[#^note-15a|lift up]] your hearts and [[#^note-15b|rejoice]], and [[#^note-15c|gird]] up your loins, and take upon you my whole [[#^note-15d|armor]], that ye may be able to with[[#^note-15e|stand]] the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand. ^verse-15

**16**  Stand, therefore, having your loins [[#^note-16a|girt]] about with [[#^note-16b|truth]], having on the [[#^note-16c|breastplate]] of [[#^note-16d|righteousness]], and your feet shod with the preparation of the [[#^note-16e|gospel]] of [[#^note-16f|peace]], which I have sent mine [[#^note-16g|angels]] to commit unto you; ^verse-16

**17**  Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the [[#^note-17a|fiery]] darts of the wicked; ^verse-17

**18**  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of my [[#^note-18a|Spirit]], which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be [[#^note-18b|caught up]], that where I am ye shall be [[#^note-18c|also]]. Amen. ^verse-18
