*1-3, Testimonies are recorded in heaven; 4-9, The elders are to travel and preach according to judgment and as directed by the Spirit.*

**1**  Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, your [[#^note-1a|advocate]], who knoweth the weakness of man and how to [[#^note-1b|succor]] them who are [[#^note-1c|tempted]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And verily mine eyes are upon those who have not as yet gone up unto the land of Zion; wherefore your mission is not yet full. ^verse-2

**3**  Nevertheless, ye are [[#^note-3a|blessed]], for the [[#^note-3b|testimony]] which ye have borne is [[#^note-3c|recorded]] in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you, and your [[#^note-3d|sins]] are forgiven you. ^verse-3

**4**  And now continue your journey. Assemble yourselves upon the land of [[#^note-4a|Zion]]; and hold a meeting and rejoice together, and offer a [[#^note-4b|sacrament]] unto the Most High. ^verse-4

**5**  And then you may return to bear record, yea, even altogether, or [[#^note-5a|two by two]], as seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto me; only be faithful, and [[#^note-5b|declare]] glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, or among the [[#^note-5c|congregations]] of the wicked. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I, the Lord, have brought you together that the [[#^note-6a|promise]] might be fulfilled, that the faithful among you should be preserved and rejoice together in the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, promise the faithful and cannot [[#^note-6b|lie]]. ^verse-6

**7**  I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you [[#^note-7a|desire]] to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it from the hand of the Lord, with a [[#^note-7b|thankful]] heart in all things. ^verse-7

**8**  These things remain with you to do according to judgment and the directions of the Spirit. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, the [[#^note-9a|kingdom]] is yours. And behold, and lo, I am [[#^note-9b|with]] the faithful always. Even so. Amen. ^verse-9
