*1-4, Beasts have spirits and will dwell in eternal felicity; 5-7, This earth has a temporal existence of 7,000 years; 8-10, Various angels restore the gospel and minister on earth; 11, The sealing of the 144,000; 12-14, Christ will come in the beginning of the seventh thousand years; 15, Two prophets will be raised up to the Jewish nation.*

**1**  Q. What is the [[#^note-1a|sea]] of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation?A. It is the [[#^note-1b|earth]], in its [[#^note-1c|sanctified]], [[#^note-1d|immortal]], and [[#^note-1e|eternal]] state. ^verse-1

**2**  Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse?A. They are [[#^note-2a|figurative]] expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing [[#^note-2b|heaven]], the [[#^note-2c|paradise]] of God, the [[#^note-2d|happiness]] of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is [[#^note-2e|spirit]]ual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the [[#^note-2f|beast]], and every other creature which God has created. ^verse-2

**3**  Q. Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or [[#^note-3a|orders]]?A. They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John, to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined [[#^note-3b|order]] or [[#^note-3c|sphere]] of creation, in the enjoyment of their [[#^note-3d|eternal]] [[#^note-3e|felicity]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Q. What are we to understand by the [[#^note-4a|eyes]] and [[#^note-4b|wings]], which the beasts had?A. Their eyes are a representation of light and [[#^note-4c|knowledge]], that is, they are full of knowledge; and their wings are a [[#^note-4d|representation]] of [[#^note-4e|power]], to move, to act, etc. ^verse-4

**5**  Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty [[#^note-5a|elders]], spoken of by John?A. We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who had been [[#^note-5b|faithful]] in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged to the [[#^note-5c|seven]] churches, and were then in the paradise of God. ^verse-5

**6**  Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was [[#^note-6a|sealed]] on the back with seven seals?A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, [[#^note-6b|mysteries]], and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this [[#^note-6c|earth]] during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence. ^verse-6

**7**  Q. What are we to understand by the seven [[#^note-7a|seals]] with which it was sealed?A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the [[#^note-7b|first thousand]] years, and the [[#^note-7c|second]] also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh. ^verse-7

**8**  Q. What are we to understand by the four [[#^note-8a|angels]], spoken of in the 7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation?A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the [[#^note-8b|everlasting gospel]] to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to [[#^note-8c|shut up]] the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the [[#^note-8d|regions]] of darkness. ^verse-8

**9**  Q. What are we to understand by the angel [[#^note-9a|ascending]] from the east, Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd verse?A. We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of [[#^note-9b|Israel]]; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their [[#^note-9c|foreheads]]. And, if you will receive it, this is [[#^note-9d|Elias]] which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and [[#^note-9e|restore]] all things. ^verse-9

**10**  Q. What time are the things spoken of in this chapter to be accomplished?A. They are to be accomplished in the [[#^note-10a|sixth thousand]] years, or the opening of the sixth seal. ^verse-10

**11**  Q. What are we to understand by sealing the [[#^note-11a|one]] hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel—twelve thousand out of every tribe?A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are [[#^note-11b|high priests]], ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the [[#^note-11c|Firstborn]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the [[#^note-12a|trumpets]], mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelation?A. We are to understand that as God [[#^note-12b|made]] the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and [[#^note-12c|sanctified]] it, and also formed man out of the [[#^note-12d|dust]] of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God [[#^note-12e|sanctify]] the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and [[#^note-12f|judge]] all things, and shall [[#^note-12g|redeem]] all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the [[#^note-12h|preparing]] and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years—the preparing of the way before the time of his coming. ^verse-12

**13**  Q. When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9th chapter of Revelation?A. They are to be accomplished after the [[#^note-13a|opening]] of the seventh seal, [[#^note-13b|before]] the coming of Christ. ^verse-13

**14**  Q. What are we to understand by the little book which was [[#^note-14a|eaten]] by John, as mentioned in the 10th chapter of Revelation?A. We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him to [[#^note-14b|gather]] the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written, must come and [[#^note-14c|restore]] all things. ^verse-14

**15**  Q. What is to be understood by the two [[#^note-15a|witnesses]], in the eleventh chapter of Revelation?A. They are two prophets that are to be raised up to the [[#^note-15b|Jewish nation]] in the last days, at the time of the [[#^note-15c|restoration]], and to prophesy to the Jews after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the [[#^note-15d|land]] of their fathers. ^verse-15
