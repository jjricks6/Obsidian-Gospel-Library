*1-8, Christ gathers His elect; 9-11, His coming ushers in the Millennium; 12-13, The Twelve will judge all Israel; 14-21, Signs, plagues, and desolations will precede the Second Coming; 22-28, The last resurrection and final judgment follow the Millennium; 29-35, All things are spiritual unto the Lord; 36-39, The devil and his hosts were cast out of heaven to tempt man; 40-45, The Fall and Atonement bring salvation; 46-50, Little children are redeemed through the Atonement.*

**1**  Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great [[#^note-1a|I Am]], whose arm of [[#^note-1b|mercy]] hath [[#^note-1c|atoned]] for your sins; ^verse-1

**2**  Who will [[#^note-2a|gather]] his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and [[#^note-2b|humble]] themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that at this time your [[#^note-3a|sins]] are [[#^note-3b|forgiven]] you, therefore ye receive these things; but remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you. ^verse-3

**4**  Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with the [[#^note-4a|voice]] of a trump. ^verse-4

**5**  Lift up your hearts and be [[#^note-5a|glad]], for I am in your [[#^note-5b|midst]], and am your [[#^note-5c|advocate]] with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the [[#^note-5d|kingdom]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And, as it is written—Whatsoever ye shall [[#^note-6a|ask]] in [[#^note-6b|faith]], being [[#^note-6c|united]] in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive. ^verse-6

**7**  And ye are called to bring to pass the [[#^note-7a|gathering]] of mine [[#^note-7b|elect]]; for mine elect [[#^note-7c|hear]] my voice and [[#^note-7d|harden]] not their [[#^note-7e|hearts]]; ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be [[#^note-8a|gathered]] in unto one place upon the face of this land, to [[#^note-8b|prepare]] their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when [[#^note-8c|tribulation]] and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked. ^verse-8

**9**  For the hour is nigh and the [[#^note-9a|day]] soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and all the [[#^note-9b|proud]] and they that do wickedly shall be as [[#^note-9c|stubble]]; and I will [[#^note-9d|burn]] them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the earth; ^verse-9

**10**  For the hour is nigh, and that which was [[#^note-10a|spoken]] by mine [[#^note-10b|apostles]] must be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass; ^verse-10

**11**  For I will reveal [[#^note-11a|myself]] from heaven with power and great glory, with all the [[#^note-11b|hosts]] thereof, and [[#^note-11c|dwell]] in [[#^note-11d|righteousness]] with men on earth a [[#^note-11e|thousand]] years, and the wicked shall not stand. ^verse-11

**12**  And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine [[#^note-12a|apostles]], the Twelve which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of [[#^note-12b|fire]], being clothed with robes of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in [[#^note-12c|glory]] even as I am, to [[#^note-12d|judge]] the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept my commandments, and none else. ^verse-12

**13**  For a [[#^note-13a|trump]] shall sound both long and loud, even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the [[#^note-13b|earth]] shall quake, and they shall [[#^note-13c|come]] forth—yea, even the [[#^note-13d|dead]] which died in me, to receive a [[#^note-13e|crown]] of righteousness, and to be clothed upon, [[#^note-13f|even]] as I am, to be with me, that we may be one. ^verse-13

**14**  But, behold, I say unto you that before this great [[#^note-14a|day]] shall come the [[#^note-14b|sun]] shall be [[#^note-14c|darkened]], and the moon shall be turned into blood, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and there shall be greater [[#^note-14d|signs]] in heaven above and in the earth beneath; ^verse-14

**15**  And there shall be weeping and [[#^note-15a|wailing]] among the hosts of men; ^verse-15

**16**  And there shall be a great [[#^note-16a|hailstorm]] sent forth to destroy the [[#^note-16b|crops]] of the earth. ^verse-16

**17**  And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that I will take [[#^note-17a|vengeance]] upon the [[#^note-17b|wicked]], for they will not repent; for the [[#^note-17c|cup]] of mine [[#^note-17d|indignation]] is full; for behold, my [[#^note-17e|blood]] shall not [[#^note-17f|cleanse]] them if they hear me not. ^verse-17

**18**  Wherefore, I the Lord God will send forth [[#^note-18a|flies]] upon the face of the earth, which shall take hold of the inhabitants thereof, and shall eat their flesh, and shall cause maggots to come in upon them; ^verse-18

**19**  And their tongues shall be stayed that they shall not [[#^note-19a|utter]] against me; and their flesh shall fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their sockets; ^verse-19

**20**  And it shall come to pass that the [[#^note-20a|beasts]] of the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour them up. ^verse-20

**21**  And the great and [[#^note-21a|abominable]] church, which is the [[#^note-21b|whore]] of all the earth, shall be cast down by [[#^note-21c|devouring fire]], according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely [[#^note-21d|must]], as I live, for [[#^note-21e|abominations]] shall not reign. ^verse-21

**22**  And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the [[#^note-22a|thousand]] years are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a [[#^note-22b|little season]]; ^verse-22

**23**  And the [[#^note-23a|end]] shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and [[#^note-23b|pass away]], and there shall be a new heaven and a [[#^note-23c|new earth]]. ^verse-23

**24**  For all [[#^note-24a|old]] things shall [[#^note-24b|pass away]], and all things shall become new, even the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and [[#^note-24c|beasts]], the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; ^verse-24

**25**  And not one [[#^note-25a|hair]], neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the [[#^note-25b|workmanship]] of mine hand. ^verse-25

**26**  But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away, [[#^note-26a|Michael]], mine archangel, shall sound his [[#^note-26b|trump]], and then shall all the dead [[#^note-26c|awake]], for their graves shall be opened, and they shall [[#^note-26d|come]] forth—yea, even all. ^verse-26

**27**  And the [[#^note-27a|righteous]] shall be gathered on my [[#^note-27b|right hand]] unto eternal life; and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father; ^verse-27

**28**  Wherefore I will say unto them—[[#^note-28a|Depart]] from me, ye cursed, into everlasting [[#^note-28b|fire]], prepared for the [[#^note-28c|devil]] and his angels. ^verse-28

**29**  And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return, for [[#^note-29a|where]] I am they cannot come, for they have no power. ^verse-29

**30**  But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled, that the [[#^note-30a|first]] shall be last, and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power, which is the power of my [[#^note-30b|Spirit]]. ^verse-30

**31**  For by the power of my Spirit [[#^note-31a|created]] I them; yea, all things both [[#^note-31b|spiritual]] and temporal— ^verse-31

**32**  [[#^note-32a|First]] [[#^note-32b|spiritual]], secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work; and again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my work— ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|Speaking]] unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my works have no [[#^note-33b|end]], neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed. ^verse-33

**34**  Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a [[#^note-34a|law]] which was [[#^note-34b|temporal]]; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created. ^verse-34

**35**  Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an [[#^note-35a|agent]] unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my [[#^note-35b|commandments]] are [[#^note-35c|spiritual]]; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual. ^verse-35

**36**  And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the [[#^note-36a|devil]]—for, behold, the [[#^note-36b|devil]] was before Adam, for he [[#^note-36c|rebelled]] against me, saying, Give me thine [[#^note-36d|honor]], which is my [[#^note-36e|power]]; and also a [[#^note-36f|third]] part of the [[#^note-36g|hosts]] of heaven turned he away from me because of their [[#^note-36h|agency]]; ^verse-36

**37**  And they were thrust down, and thus came the [[#^note-37a|devil]] and his [[#^note-37b|angels]]; ^verse-37

**38**  And, behold, there is a place [[#^note-38a|prepared]] for them from the beginning, which place is [[#^note-38b|hell]]. ^verse-38

**39**  And it must needs be that the [[#^note-39a|devil]] should [[#^note-39b|tempt]] the children of men, or they could not be [[#^note-39c|agents]] unto themselves; for if they never should have [[#^note-39d|bitter]] they could not know the sweet— ^verse-39

**40**  Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden [[#^note-40a|fruit]] and [[#^note-40b|transgressed]] the commandment, wherein he became [[#^note-40c|subject]] to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation. ^verse-40

**41**  Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be [[#^note-41a|cast out]] from the Garden of [[#^note-41b|Eden]], from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became [[#^note-41c|spiritually]] [[#^note-41d|dead]], which is the first [[#^note-41e|death]], even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye [[#^note-41f|cursed]]. ^verse-41

**42**  But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they should not [[#^note-42a|die]] as to the temporal death, until I, the Lord God, should send forth [[#^note-42b|angels]] to declare unto them [[#^note-42c|repentance]] and [[#^note-42d|redemption]], through faith on the name of mine [[#^note-42e|Only Begotten Son]]. ^verse-42

**43**  And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his [[#^note-43a|probation]]—that by his [[#^note-43b|natural]] death he might be [[#^note-43c|raised]] in [[#^note-43d|immortality]] unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; ^verse-43

**44**  And they that believe not unto eternal [[#^note-44a|damnation]]; for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual [[#^note-44b|fall]], because they repent not; ^verse-44

**45**  For they love darkness rather than light, and their [[#^note-45a|deeds]] are evil, and they receive their [[#^note-45b|wages]] of [[#^note-45c|whom]] they list to obey. ^verse-45

**46**  But behold, I say unto you, that little [[#^note-46a|children]] are [[#^note-46b|redeemed]] from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten; ^verse-46

**47**  Wherefore, they cannot [[#^note-47a|sin]], for power is not given unto Satan to [[#^note-47b|tempt]] little children, until they [[#^note-47c|begin]] to become [[#^note-47d|accountable]] before me; ^verse-47

**48**  For it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own [[#^note-48a|pleasure]], that great things may be required at the hand of their [[#^note-48b|fathers]]. ^verse-48

**49**  And, again, I say unto you, that whoso having knowledge, have I not commanded to [[#^note-49a|repent]]? ^verse-49

**50**  And he that hath no [[#^note-50a|understanding]], it remaineth in me to do according as it is written. And now I declare no more unto you at this time. Amen. ^verse-50
