*1-3, Warren A. Cowdery is called as a local presiding officer; 4-5, The Second Coming will not overtake the children of light as a thief; 6-8, Great blessings follow faithful service in the Church.*

**1**  It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of [[#^note-1a|Freedom]] and the regions round about; ^verse-1

**2**  And should preach my [[#^note-2a|everlasting gospel]], and lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties; ^verse-2

**3**  And devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give unto him, [[#^note-3a|seeking]] diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for the [[#^note-3b|laborer]] is worthy of his hire. ^verse-3

**4**  And again, verily I say unto you, the [[#^note-4a|coming]] of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a [[#^note-4b|thief]] in the nightâ€” ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the [[#^note-5a|children]] of light, and that day shall not [[#^note-5b|overtake]] you as a thief. ^verse-5

**6**  And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in heaven when my servant Warren bowed to my scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of men; ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him; and, notwithstanding the [[#^note-7a|vanity]] of his heart, I will lift him up inasmuch as he will humble himself before me. ^verse-7

**8**  And I will give him [[#^note-8a|grace]] and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a faithful witness and a [[#^note-8b|light]] unto the church I have prepared a crown for him in the [[#^note-8c|mansions]] of my Father. Even so. Amen. ^verse-8
