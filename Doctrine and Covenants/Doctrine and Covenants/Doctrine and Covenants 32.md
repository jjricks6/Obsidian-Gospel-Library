*1-3, Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson are called to preach to the Lamanites and to accompany Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer Jr.; 4-5, They are to pray for an understanding of the scriptures.*

**1**  And now concerning my servant [[#^note-1a|Parley P. Pratt]], behold, I say unto him that as I live I will that he shall declare my gospel and [[#^note-1b|learn]] of me, and be meek and lowly of heart. ^verse-1

**2**  And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall [[#^note-2a|go]] with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the [[#^note-2b|Lamanites]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And [[#^note-3a|Ziba Peterson]] also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be in their [[#^note-3b|midst]]; and I am their [[#^note-3c|advocate]] with the Father, and nothing shall [[#^note-3d|prevail]] against them. ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall give [[#^note-4a|heed]] to that which is written, and pretend to no other [[#^note-4b|revelation]]; and they shall pray always that I may [[#^note-4c|unfold]] the same to their [[#^note-4d|understanding]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen. ^verse-5
