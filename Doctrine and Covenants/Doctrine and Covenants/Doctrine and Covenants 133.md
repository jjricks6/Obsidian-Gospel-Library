*1-6, The Saints are commanded to prepare for the Second Coming; 7-16, All men are commanded to flee from Babylon, come to Zion, and prepare for the great day of the Lord; 17-35, He will stand on Mount Zion, the continents will become one land, and the lost tribes of Israel will return; 36-40, The gospel was restored through Joseph Smith to be preached in all the world; 41-51, The Lord will come down in vengeance upon the wicked; 52-56, It will be the year of His redeemed; 57-74, The gospel is to be sent forth to save the Saints and for the destruction of the wicked.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the Lord your God, and hear the word of the Lord concerning you— ^verse-1

**2**  The Lord who shall suddenly [[#^note-2a|come]] to his temple; the Lord who shall come down upon the world with a curse to [[#^note-2b|judgment]]; yea, upon all the nations that [[#^note-2c|forget]] God, and upon all the ungodly among you. ^verse-2

**3**  For he shall make [[#^note-3a|bare]] his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the [[#^note-3b|salvation]] of their God. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people; sanctify yourselves; gather ye together, O ye people of my church, upon the land of Zion, all you that have not been commanded to [[#^note-4a|tarry]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Go ye out from [[#^note-5a|Babylon]]. Be ye [[#^note-5b|clean]] that bear the vessels of the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Call your [[#^note-6a|solemn assemblies]], and [[#^note-6b|speak]] often one to another. And let every man call upon the name of the Lord. ^verse-6

**7**  Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of the Lord is unto you: Go ye out of Babylon; [[#^note-7a|gather]] ye out from among the nations, from the [[#^note-7b|four]] winds, from one end of heaven to the other. ^verse-7

**8**  Send forth the elders of my church unto the [[#^note-8a|nations]] which are afar off; unto the [[#^note-8b|islands]] of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the [[#^note-8c|Gentiles]], and then upon the Jews. ^verse-8

**9**  And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people: Go ye forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my people may be enlarged, and that her [[#^note-9a|stakes]] may be strengthened, and that [[#^note-9b|Zion]] may go forth unto the regions round about. ^verse-9

**10**  Yea, let the cry go forth among all people: Awake and arise and go forth to meet the [[#^note-10a|Bridegroom]]; behold and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Prepare yourselves for the [[#^note-10b|great day]] of the Lord. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Watch]], therefore, for ye [[#^note-11b|know]] neither the day nor the hour. ^verse-11

**12**  Let them, therefore, who are [[#^note-12a|among]] the Gentiles flee unto [[#^note-12b|Zion]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And let them who be of [[#^note-13a|Judah]] flee unto [[#^note-13b|Jerusalem]], unto the [[#^note-13c|mountains]] of the Lord's [[#^note-13d|house]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Go ye [[#^note-14a|out]] from among the nations, even from [[#^note-14b|Babylon]], from the midst of [[#^note-14c|wickedness]], which is spiritual Babylon. ^verse-14

**15**  But verily, thus saith the Lord, let not your flight be in [[#^note-15a|haste]], but let all things be prepared before you; and he that goeth, let him [[#^note-15b|not]] look back lest sudden destruction shall come upon him. ^verse-15

**16**  Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. [[#^note-16a|Listen]], ye elders of my church together, and hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all men, and he commandeth all men everywhere to [[#^note-16b|repent]]. ^verse-16

**17**  For behold, the Lord God hath [[#^note-17a|sent]] forth the angel crying through the midst of heaven, saying: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight, for the hour of his [[#^note-17b|coming]] is nigh— ^verse-17

**18**  When the [[#^note-18a|Lamb]] shall stand upon [[#^note-18b|Mount Zion]], and with him a [[#^note-18c|hundred]] and forty-four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, prepare ye for the [[#^note-19a|coming]] of the Bridegroom; go ye, go ye out to meet him. ^verse-19

**20**  For behold, he shall [[#^note-20a|stand]] upon the mount of Olivet, and upon the mighty ocean, even the great deep, and upon the islands of the sea, and upon the land of Zion. ^verse-20

**21**  And he shall [[#^note-21a|utter]] his voice out of [[#^note-21b|Zion]], and he shall speak from Jerusalem, and his [[#^note-21c|voice]] shall be heard among all people; ^verse-21

**22**  And it shall be a [[#^note-22a|voice]] as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great [[#^note-22b|thunder]], which shall [[#^note-22c|break]] down the mountains, and the valleys shall not be found. ^verse-22

**23**  He shall command the great deep, and it shall be driven back into the north countries, and the [[#^note-23a|islands]] shall become one land; ^verse-23

**24**  And the [[#^note-24a|land of Jerusalem]] and the land of [[#^note-24b|Zion]] shall be turned back into their own place, and the [[#^note-24c|earth]] shall be like as it was in the days before it was [[#^note-24d|divided]]. ^verse-24

**25**  And the Lord, even the Savior, shall [[#^note-25a|stand]] in the midst of his people, and shall [[#^note-25b|reign]] over all flesh. ^verse-25

**26**  And they who are in the [[#^note-26a|north]] countries shall come in remembrance before the Lord; and their prophets shall hear his voice, and shall no longer stay themselves; and they shall [[#^note-26b|smite]] the rocks, and the ice shall flow down at their presence. ^verse-26

**27**  And an [[#^note-27a|highway]] shall be cast up in the midst of the great deep. ^verse-27

**28**  Their enemies shall become a prey unto them, ^verse-28

**29**  And in the [[#^note-29a|barren]] deserts there shall come forth pools of [[#^note-29b|living water]]; and the parched ground shall no longer be a thirsty land. ^verse-29

**30**  And they shall bring forth their rich [[#^note-30a|treasures]] unto the children of Ephraim, my servants. ^verse-30

**31**  And the boundaries of the everlasting [[#^note-31a|hills]] shall tremble at their presence. ^verse-31

**32**  And there shall they fall down and be [[#^note-32a|crowned]] with glory, even in Zion, by the hands of the servants of the Lord, even the children of [[#^note-32b|Ephraim]]. ^verse-32

**33**  And they shall be filled with [[#^note-33a|songs]] of everlasting joy. ^verse-33

**34**  Behold, this is the [[#^note-34a|blessing]] of the [[#^note-34b|everlasting]] God upon the [[#^note-34c|tribes]] of [[#^note-34d|Israel]], and the richer blessing upon the head of [[#^note-34e|Ephraim]] and his fellows. ^verse-34

**35**  And they also of the tribe of [[#^note-35a|Judah]], after their pain, shall be [[#^note-35b|sanctified]] in [[#^note-35c|holiness]] before the Lord, to dwell in his [[#^note-35d|presence]] day and night, forever and ever. ^verse-35

**36**  And now, verily saith the Lord, that these things might be known among you, O inhabitants of the earth, I have sent forth mine [[#^note-36a|angel]] flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting [[#^note-36b|gospel]], who hath appeared unto some and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear unto [[#^note-36c|many]] that dwell on the earth. ^verse-36

**37**  And this [[#^note-37a|gospel]] shall be [[#^note-37b|preached]] unto [[#^note-37c|every]] nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. ^verse-37

**38**  And the [[#^note-38a|servants]] of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice: Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; ^verse-38

**39**  And [[#^note-39a|worship]] him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the [[#^note-39b|fountains]] of waters— ^verse-39

**40**  Calling upon the name of the Lord day and night, saying: O that thou wouldst [[#^note-40a|rend]] the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence. ^verse-40

**41**  And it shall be answered upon their heads; for the presence of the Lord shall be [[#^note-41a|as]] the melting fire that burneth, and as the fire which causeth the waters to boil. ^verse-41

**42**  O Lord, thou shalt come down to make thy name known to thine adversaries, and all nations shall tremble at thy presence— ^verse-42

**43**  When thou doest [[#^note-43a|terrible]] things, things they look not for; ^verse-43

**44**  Yea, when thou comest down, and the mountains flow down at thy presence, thou shalt [[#^note-44a|meet]] him who rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, who remembereth thee in thy ways. ^verse-44

**45**  For since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast [[#^note-45a|prepared]] for him that [[#^note-45b|waiteth]] for thee. ^verse-45

**46**  And it shall be said: [[#^note-46a|Who]] is this that cometh down from God in heaven with dyed [[#^note-46b|garments]]; yea, from the regions which are not known, clothed in his glorious apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? ^verse-46

**47**  And he shall say: [[#^note-47a|I]] am he who spake in [[#^note-47b|righteousness]], mighty to save. ^verse-47

**48**  And the Lord shall be [[#^note-48a|red]] in his apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat. ^verse-48

**49**  And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the [[#^note-49a|sun]] shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from their places. ^verse-49

**50**  And his [[#^note-50a|voice]] shall be heard: I have [[#^note-50b|trodden]] the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon all people; and none were with me; ^verse-50

**51**  And I have [[#^note-51a|trampled]] them in my fury, and I did tread upon them in mine anger, and their blood have I [[#^note-51b|sprinkled]] upon my garments, and stained all my raiment; for this was the [[#^note-51c|day]] of vengeance which was in my heart. ^verse-51

**52**  And now the year of my [[#^note-52a|redeemed]] is come; and they shall mention the loving kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his [[#^note-52b|goodness]], and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever. ^verse-52

**53**  In all their [[#^note-53a|afflictions]] he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved them; and in his [[#^note-53b|love]], and in his pity, he [[#^note-53c|redeemed]] them, and bore them, and carried them all the days of old; ^verse-53

**54**  Yea, and [[#^note-54a|Enoch]] also, and they who were with him; the prophets who were before him; and [[#^note-54b|Noah]] also, and they who were before him; and [[#^note-54c|Moses]] also, and they who were before him; ^verse-54

**55**  And from [[#^note-55a|Moses]] to Elijah, and from Elijah to John, who were with Christ in his [[#^note-55b|resurrection]], and the holy apostles, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, shall be in the presence of the Lamb. ^verse-55

**56**  And the [[#^note-56a|graves]] of the [[#^note-56b|saints]] shall be [[#^note-56c|opened]]; and they shall come forth and stand on the [[#^note-56d|right hand]] of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon [[#^note-56e|Mount Zion]], and upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem; and they shall [[#^note-56f|sing]] the [[#^note-56g|song]] of the [[#^note-56h|Lamb]], day and night forever and ever. ^verse-56

**57**  And for this cause, that men might be made [[#^note-57a|partakers]] of the [[#^note-57b|glories]] which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his [[#^note-57c|gospel]], his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity— ^verse-57

**58**  To [[#^note-58a|prepare]] the [[#^note-58b|weak]] for those things which are coming on the earth, and for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall [[#^note-58c|confound]] the [[#^note-58d|wise]], and the little one become a [[#^note-58e|strong]] [[#^note-58f|nation]], and two shall put their tens of thousands to [[#^note-58g|flight]]. ^verse-58

**59**  And by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall [[#^note-59a|thresh]] the nations by the power of his Spirit. ^verse-59

**60**  And for this cause these commandments were given; they were commanded to be kept from the world in the day that they were given, but now are to [[#^note-60a|go forth]] unto [[#^note-60b|all]] flesh— ^verse-60

**61**  And this according to the mind and will of the Lord, who ruleth over all flesh. ^verse-61

**62**  And unto him that repenteth and [[#^note-62a|sanctifieth]] himself before the Lord shall be given eternal life. ^verse-62

**63**  And upon them that [[#^note-63a|hearken not]] to the voice of the Lord shall be fulfilled that which was written by the prophet Moses, that they should be [[#^note-63b|cut off]] from among the people. ^verse-63

**64**  And also that which was written by the prophet [[#^note-64a|Malachi]]: For, behold, the [[#^note-64b|day]] cometh that shall [[#^note-64c|burn]] as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do [[#^note-64d|wickedly]], shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. ^verse-64

**65**  Wherefore, this shall be the answer of the Lord unto them: ^verse-65

**66**  In that day when I came unto mine own, no man among you [[#^note-66a|received]] me, and you were driven out. ^verse-66

**67**  When I called again there was none of you to answer; yet my [[#^note-67a|arm]] was not shortened at all that I could not redeem, neither my [[#^note-67b|power]] to deliver. ^verse-67

**68**  Behold, at my rebuke I [[#^note-68a|dry up]] the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, and die for thirst. ^verse-68

**69**  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering. ^verse-69

**70**  And [[#^note-70a|this]] shall ye have of my hand—ye shall lie down in sorrow. ^verse-70

**71**  Behold, and lo, there are none to deliver you; for ye [[#^note-71a|obeyed not]] my voice when I called to you out of the heavens; ye [[#^note-71b|believed not]] my servants, and when they were [[#^note-71c|sent]] unto you ye received them not. ^verse-71

**72**  Wherefore, they sealed up the testimony and bound up the law, and ye were delivered over unto [[#^note-72a|darkness]]. ^verse-72

**73**  These shall go away into outer darkness, where there is [[#^note-73a|weeping]], and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-73

**74**  Behold the Lord your God hath spoken it. Amen. ^verse-74
