*1-3, Brigham Young is commended for his labors and is relieved of future travel abroad.*

**1**  Dear and well-beloved brother, [[#^note-1a|Brigham Young]], verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant Brigham, it is [[#^note-1b|no more]] required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me. ^verse-1

**2**  I have seen your [[#^note-2a|labor]] and toil in journeyings for my name. ^verse-2

**3**  I therefore command you to [[#^note-3a|send]] my word abroad, and take especial [[#^note-3b|care]] of your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen. ^verse-3
