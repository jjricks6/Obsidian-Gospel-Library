*1-3, The Father and the Son may appear personally to men; 4-7, Angels reside in a celestial sphere; 8-9, The celestial earth will be a great Urim and Thummim; 10-11, A white stone is given to all who enter the celestial world; 12-17, The time of the Second Coming is withheld from the Prophet; 18-19, Intelligence gained in this life rises with us in the Resurrection; 20-21, All blessings come by obedience to law; 22-23, The Father and the Son have bodies of flesh and bones.*

**1**  When the Savior shall [[#^note-1a|appear]] we shall see him as he is. We shall see that he is a [[#^note-1b|man]] like ourselves. ^verse-1

**2**  And that same [[#^note-2a|sociality]] which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with [[#^note-2b|eternal glory]], which glory we do not now enjoy. ^verse-2

**3**  John 14:23—The [[#^note-3a|appearing]] of the Father and the Son, in that verse, is a personal [[#^note-3b|appearance]]; and the idea that the Father and the Son [[#^note-3c|dwell]] in a man's heart is an old sectarian notion, and is false. ^verse-3

**4**  In answer to the question—Is not the reckoning of God's [[#^note-4a|time]], angel's time, prophet's time, and man's time, according to the planet on which they reside? ^verse-4

**5**  I answer, Yes. But there are no [[#^note-5a|angels]] who [[#^note-5b|minister]] to this earth but those who do belong or have belonged to it. ^verse-5

**6**  The angels do not reside on a planet like this earth; ^verse-6

**7**  But [[#^note-7a|they]] reside in the [[#^note-7b|presence]] of God, on a globe [[#^note-7c|like]] a [[#^note-7d|sea]] of glass and [[#^note-7e|fire]], where all things for their glory are manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the Lord. ^verse-7

**8**  The place where God resides is a great [[#^note-8a|Urim and Thummim]]. ^verse-8

**9**  This [[#^note-9a|earth]], in its [[#^note-9b|sanctified]] and [[#^note-9c|immortal]] state, will be made like unto [[#^note-9d|crystal]] and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be [[#^note-9e|Christ's]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Then the white [[#^note-10a|stone]] mentioned in Revelation 2:17, will become a Urim and Thummim to each individual who receives one, whereby things pertaining to a [[#^note-10b|higher]] order of kingdoms will be made known; ^verse-10

**11**  And a [[#^note-11a|white stone]] is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new [[#^note-11b|name]] written, which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it. The new name is the key word. ^verse-11

**12**  I prophesy, in the name of the Lord God, that the commencement of the [[#^note-12a|difficulties]] which will cause much bloodshed previous to the coming of the Son of Man will be in South Carolina. ^verse-12

**13**  It may probably arise through the slave question. This a [[#^note-13a|voice]] declared to me, while I was praying earnestly on the subject, December 25th, 1832. ^verse-13

**14**  I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the [[#^note-14a|coming]] of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following: ^verse-14

**15**  Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore [[#^note-15a|let]] this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter. ^verse-15

**16**  I was left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether I should die and thus see his face. ^verse-16

**17**  I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time. ^verse-17

**18**  Whatever principle of [[#^note-18a|intelligence]] we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the [[#^note-18b|resurrection]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And if a person gains more [[#^note-19a|knowledge]] and intelligence in this life through his [[#^note-19b|diligence]] and obedience than another, he will have so much the [[#^note-19c|advantage]] in the world to come. ^verse-19

**20**  There is a [[#^note-20a|law]], irrevocably decreed in [[#^note-20b|heaven]] before the foundations of this world, upon which all [[#^note-20c|blessings]] are predicated— ^verse-20

**21**  And when we obtain any [[#^note-21a|blessing]] from God, it is by [[#^note-21b|obedience]] to that law upon which it is predicated. ^verse-21

**22**  The [[#^note-22a|Father]] has a [[#^note-22b|body]] of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of [[#^note-22c|Spirit]]. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not [[#^note-22d|dwell]] in us. ^verse-22

**23**  A man may receive the [[#^note-23a|Holy Ghost]], and it may descend upon him and not [[#^note-23b|tarry]] with him. ^verse-23
