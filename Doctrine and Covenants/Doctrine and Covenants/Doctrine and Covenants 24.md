*1-9, Joseph Smith is called to translate, preach, and expound scriptures; 10-12, Oliver Cowdery is called to preach the gospel; 13-19, The law is revealed relative to miracles, cursings, casting off the dust of one's feet, and going without purse or scrip.*

**1**  Behold, thou wast called and chosen to [[#^note-1a|write]] the Book of Mormon, and to my ministry; and I have [[#^note-1b|lifted]] thee up out of thine afflictions, and have counseled thee, that thou hast been [[#^note-1c|delivered]] from all thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered from the powers of Satan and from [[#^note-1d|darkness]]! ^verse-1

**2**  Nevertheless, thou art not excusable in thy [[#^note-2a|transgressions]]; nevertheless, go thy way and sin no more. ^verse-2

**3**  [[#^note-3a|Magnify]] thine office; and after thou hast [[#^note-3b|sowed]] thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the church which is in [[#^note-3c|Colesville]], Fayette, and Manchester, and they shall [[#^note-3d|support]] thee; and I will bless them both spiritually and [[#^note-3e|temporally]]; ^verse-3

**4**  But if they receive thee not, I will send upon them a [[#^note-4a|cursing]] instead of a blessing. ^verse-4

**5**  And thou shalt continue in calling upon God in my name, and writing the things which shall be given thee by the [[#^note-5a|Comforter]], and expounding all scriptures unto the church. ^verse-5

**6**  And it shall be given thee in the very moment what thou shalt [[#^note-6a|speak]] and [[#^note-6b|write]], and they shall hear it, or I will send unto them a cursing instead of a blessing. ^verse-6

**7**  For thou shalt devote all thy [[#^note-7a|service]] in Zion; and in this thou shalt have strength. ^verse-7

**8**  Be [[#^note-8a|patient]] in [[#^note-8b|afflictions]], for thou shalt have many; but [[#^note-8c|endure]] them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the [[#^note-8d|end]] of thy days. ^verse-8

**9**  And in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy [[#^note-9a|calling]]. Attend to thy calling and thou shalt have wherewith to magnify thine office, and to expound all scriptures, and continue in laying on of the hands and [[#^note-9b|confirming]] the churches. ^verse-9

**10**  And thy brother Oliver shall continue in bearing my name before the [[#^note-10a|world]], and also to the church. And he shall not suppose that he can say enough in my cause; and lo, I am with him to the end. ^verse-10

**11**  In me he shall have glory, and not of himself, whether in weakness or in strength, whether in [[#^note-11a|bonds]] or free; ^verse-11

**12**  And at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and [[#^note-12a|declare]] my gospel as with the voice of a [[#^note-12b|trump]], both day and night. And I will give unto him strength such as is not known among men. ^verse-12

**13**  Require not [[#^note-13a|miracles]], except I shall [[#^note-13b|command]] you, except [[#^note-13c|casting]] out [[#^note-13d|devils]], [[#^note-13e|healing]] the sick, and against [[#^note-13f|poisonous]] serpents, and against deadly poisons; ^verse-13

**14**  And these things ye shall not do, except it be required of you by them who [[#^note-14a|desire]] it, that the scriptures might be [[#^note-14b|fulfilled]]; for ye shall do according to that which is written. ^verse-14

**15**  And in whatsoever place ye shall [[#^note-15a|enter]], and they receive you not in my name, ye shall leave a cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the [[#^note-15b|dust]] of your feet against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside. ^verse-15

**16**  And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall lay their hands upon you by violence, ye shall command to be smitten in my name; and, behold, I will [[#^note-16a|smite]] them according to your words, in mine own due time. ^verse-16

**17**  And whosoever shall go to law with thee shall be cursed by the law. ^verse-17

**18**  And thou shalt take no [[#^note-18a|purse]] nor scrip, neither staves, neither two coats, for the church shall give unto thee in the very hour what thou needest for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for money, and for scrip. ^verse-18

**19**  For thou art called to [[#^note-19a|prune]] my vineyard with a mighty pruning, yea, even for the last time; yea, and also all those whom thou hast [[#^note-19b|ordained]], and they shall do even according to this pattern. Amen. ^verse-19
