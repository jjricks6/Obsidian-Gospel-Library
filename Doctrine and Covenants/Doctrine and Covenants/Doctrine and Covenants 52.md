*1-2, The next conference is designated to be held in Missouri; 3-8, Appointments of certain elders to travel together are made; 9-11, The elders are to teach what the apostles and prophets have written; 12-21, Those enlightened by the Spirit bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom; 22-44, Various elders are appointed to go forth preaching the gospel while traveling to Missouri for the conference.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders whom he hath called and chosen in these last days, by the [[#^note-1a|voice]] of his Spirit— ^verse-1

**2**  Saying: I, the Lord, will make known unto you what I will that ye shall do from this time until the next conference, which shall be held in Missouri, upon the [[#^note-2a|land]] which I will [[#^note-2b|consecrate]] unto my people, which are a [[#^note-2c|remnant]] of Jacob, and those who are heirs according to the [[#^note-2d|covenant]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, verily I say unto you, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take their journey as soon as preparations can be made to leave their homes, and journey to the land of [[#^note-3a|Missouri]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And inasmuch as they are faithful unto me, it shall be made known unto them what they shall do; ^verse-4

**5**  And it shall also, inasmuch as they are faithful, be made [[#^note-5a|known]] unto them the [[#^note-5b|land]] of your inheritance. ^verse-5

**6**  And inasmuch as they are not faithful, they shall be cut off, even as I will, as seemeth me good. ^verse-6

**7**  And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Lyman Wight and my servant John Corrill take their journey speedily; ^verse-7

**8**  And also my servant John Murdock, and my servant Hyrum Smith, take their journey unto the same place by the way of Detroit. ^verse-8

**9**  And let them journey from thence preaching the word by the way, saying [[#^note-9a|none]] other things than that which the [[#^note-9b|prophets]] and apostles have written, and that which is taught them by the [[#^note-9c|Comforter]] through the prayer of faith. ^verse-9

**10**  Let them go [[#^note-10a|two by two]], and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by [[#^note-10b|water]], and the laying on of the [[#^note-10c|hands]] by the water's side. ^verse-10

**11**  For thus saith the Lord, I will cut my work short in [[#^note-11a|righteousness]], for the days come that I will send forth [[#^note-11b|judgment]] unto victory. ^verse-11

**12**  And let my servant Lyman Wight beware, for Satan desireth to [[#^note-12a|sift]] him as chaff. ^verse-12

**13**  And behold, he that is [[#^note-13a|faithful]] shall be made ruler over many things. ^verse-13

**14**  And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth [[#^note-14a|deceiving]] the nations— ^verse-14

**15**  Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is [[#^note-15a|contrite]], the same is [[#^note-15b|accepted]] of me if he obey mine [[#^note-15c|ordinances]]. ^verse-15

**16**  He that [[#^note-16a|speaketh]], whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and [[#^note-16b|edifieth]], the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances. ^verse-16

**17**  And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made [[#^note-17a|strong]], and shall bring forth fruits of praise and [[#^note-17b|wisdom]], according to the revelations and truths which I have given you. ^verse-17

**18**  And again, he that is overcome and [[#^note-18a|bringeth]] not forth fruits, even according to this pattern, is not of me. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, by this pattern ye shall [[#^note-19a|know]] the spirits in all cases under the whole heavens. ^verse-19

**20**  And the days have come; according to men's faith it shall be [[#^note-20a|done]] unto them. ^verse-20

**21**  Behold, this commandment is given unto all the elders whom I have chosen. ^verse-21

**22**  And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant [[#^note-22a|Thomas B. Marsh]] and my servant [[#^note-22b|Ezra Thayre]] take their journey also, preaching the word by the way unto this same land. ^verse-22

**23**  And again, let my servant Isaac Morley and my servant Ezra Booth take their journey, also preaching the word by the way unto this same land. ^verse-23

**24**  And again, let my servants [[#^note-24a|Edward Partridge]] and Martin Harris take their journey with my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun. ^verse-24

**25**  Let my servants David Whitmer and Harvey Whitlock also take their journey, and preach by the way unto this same land. ^verse-25

**26**  And let my servants [[#^note-26a|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[#^note-26b|Orson Pratt]] take their journey, and preach by the way, even unto this same land. ^verse-26

**27**  And let my servants Solomon Hancock and Simeon Carter also take their journey unto this same land, and preach by the way. ^verse-27

**28**  Let my servants Edson Fuller and Jacob Scott also take their journey. ^verse-28

**29**  Let my servants Levi W. Hancock and Zebedee Coltrin also take their journey. ^verse-29

**30**  Let my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Samuel H. Smith also take their journey. ^verse-30

**31**  Let my servants Wheeler Baldwin and William Carter also take their journey. ^verse-31

**32**  And let my servants [[#^note-32a|Newel Knight]] and [[#^note-32b|Selah J. Griffin]] both be ordained, and also take their journey. ^verse-32

**33**  Yea, verily I say, let all these take their journey unto one place, in their several courses, and one man shall not build upon another's [[#^note-33a|foundation]], neither journey in another's track. ^verse-33

**34**  He that is faithful, the same shall be kept and blessed with much [[#^note-34a|fruit]]. ^verse-34

**35**  And again, I say unto you, let my servants Joseph Wakefield and Solomon Humphrey take their journey into the eastern lands; ^verse-35

**36**  Let them labor with their families, [[#^note-36a|declaring]] none other things than the prophets and apostles, that which they have [[#^note-36b|seen]] and heard and most assuredly [[#^note-36c|believe]], that the prophecies may be fulfilled. ^verse-36

**37**  In consequence of transgression, let that which was bestowed upon Heman Basset be [[#^note-37a|taken]] from him, and placed upon the head of Simonds Ryder. ^verse-37

**38**  And again, verily I say unto you, let Jared Carter be [[#^note-38a|ordained]] a [[#^note-38b|priest]], and also George James be ordained a priest. ^verse-38

**39**  Let the residue of the elders [[#^note-39a|watch]] over the churches, and declare the word in the regions round about them; and let them [[#^note-39b|labor]] with their own hands that there be no [[#^note-39c|idolatry]] nor wickedness practiced. ^verse-39

**40**  And remember in all things the [[#^note-40a|poor]] and the [[#^note-40b|needy]], the [[#^note-40c|sick]] and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple. ^verse-40

**41**  And again, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge take with them a [[#^note-41a|recommend]] from the church. And let there be one obtained for my servant Oliver Cowdery also. ^verse-41

**42**  And thus, even as I have said, if ye are faithful ye shall assemble yourselves together to rejoice upon the land of [[#^note-42a|Missouri]], which is the land of your [[#^note-42b|inheritance]], which is now the land of your enemies. ^verse-42

**43**  But, behold, I, the Lord, will hasten the city in its time, and will crown the faithful with [[#^note-43a|joy]] and with rejoicing. ^verse-43

**44**  Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and I will [[#^note-44a|lift]] them up at the last day. Even so. Amen. ^verse-44
