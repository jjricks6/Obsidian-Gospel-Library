*1-2, The keys of the kingdom are always held by the First Presidency; 3-7, If Frederick G. Williams is faithful in his ministry, he will have eternal life.*

**1**  Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a [[#^note-1a|high priest]] in my church, and a [[#^note-1b|counselor]] unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.; ^verse-1

**2**  Unto whom I have given the [[#^note-2a|keys]] of the kingdom, which belong always unto the [[#^note-2b|Presidency]] of the High Priesthood: ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will bless him, and also thee, inasmuch as thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed unto you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy heart, in public and in private, also in thy [[#^note-3a|ministry]] in proclaiming the gospel in the [[#^note-3b|land]] of the living, and among thy brethren. ^verse-3

**4**  And in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest [[#^note-4a|good]] unto thy fellow beings, and wilt promote the [[#^note-4b|glory]] of him who is your Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; [[#^note-5a|succor]] the [[#^note-5b|weak]], lift up the hands which hang down, and [[#^note-5c|strengthen]] the [[#^note-5d|feeble]] knees. ^verse-5

**6**  And if thou art [[#^note-6a|faithful]] unto the end thou shalt have a [[#^note-6b|crown]] of [[#^note-6c|immortality]], and eternal life in the [[#^note-6d|mansions]] which I have prepared in the house of my Father. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, and lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen. ^verse-7
