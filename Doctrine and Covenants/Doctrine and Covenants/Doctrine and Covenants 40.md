*1-3, Fear of persecution and cares of the world cause rejection of the gospel.*

**1**  Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant [[#^note-1a|James Covel]] was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word. ^verse-1

**2**  And he [[#^note-2a|received]] the word with gladness, but straightway Satan [[#^note-2b|tempted]] him; and the fear of [[#^note-2c|persecution]] and the cares of the world caused him to [[#^note-2d|reject]] the word. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore he [[#^note-3a|broke]] my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen. ^verse-3
