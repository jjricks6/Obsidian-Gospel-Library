*1-5, Paul counsels the Church of his day not to keep the law of Moses; 6-7, Little children are holy and are sanctified through the Atonement.*

**1**  For the [[#^note-1a|unbelieving]] [[#^note-1b|husband]] is [[#^note-1c|sanctified]] by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children unclean, but now are they holy. ^verse-1

**2**  Now, in the days of the apostles the law of circumcision was had among all the Jews who believed not the gospel of Jesus Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  And it came to pass that there arose a great [[#^note-3a|contention]] among the people concerning the law of [[#^note-3b|circumcision]], for the unbelieving husband was desirous that his children should be circumcised and become subject to the [[#^note-3c|law]] of Moses, which law was fulfilled. ^verse-3

**4**  And it came to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection to the law of Moses, gave heed to the [[#^note-4a|traditions]] of their fathers and believed not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became unholy. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, for this cause the apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto them a commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should not be [[#^note-5a|united]] to an [[#^note-5b|unbeliever]]; except the [[#^note-5c|law]] of Moses should be done away among them, ^verse-5

**6**  That their children might remain without circumcision; and that the [[#^note-6a|tradition]] might be done away, which saith that little children are unholy; for it was had among the Jews; ^verse-6

**7**  But little [[#^note-7a|children]] are [[#^note-7b|holy]], being [[#^note-7c|sanctified]] through the [[#^note-7d|atonement]] of Jesus Christ; and this is what the scriptures mean. ^verse-7
