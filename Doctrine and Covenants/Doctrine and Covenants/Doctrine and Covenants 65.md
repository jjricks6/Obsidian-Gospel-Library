*1-2, The keys of the kingdom of God are committed to man on earth, and the gospel cause will triumph; 3-6, The millennial kingdom of heaven will come and join the kingdom of God on earth.*

**1**  Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men—[[#^note-1a|Prepare]] ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|keys]] of the [[#^note-2b|kingdom]] of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the [[#^note-2c|gospel]] roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the [[#^note-2d|stone]] which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has [[#^note-2e|filled]] the whole earth. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, a voice crying—[[#^note-3a|Prepare]] ye the way of the Lord, prepare ye the [[#^note-3b|supper]] of the Lamb, make ready for the [[#^note-3c|Bridegroom]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Pray unto the Lord, [[#^note-4a|call]] upon his holy name, make known his wonderful [[#^note-4b|works]] among the people. ^verse-4

**5**  Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to [[#^note-5a|come]], in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, [[#^note-5b|clothed]] in the brightness of his [[#^note-5c|glory]], to meet the [[#^note-5d|kingdom]] of God which is set up on the earth. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, may the [[#^note-6a|kingdom]] of God go forth, that the [[#^note-6b|kingdom]] of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be [[#^note-6c|glorified]] in heaven so on earth, that thine [[#^note-6d|enemies]] may be subdued; for [[#^note-6e|thine]] is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever. Amen. ^verse-6
