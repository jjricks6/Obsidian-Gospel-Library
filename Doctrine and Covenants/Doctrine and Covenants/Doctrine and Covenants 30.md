*1-4, David Whitmer is chastened for failure to serve diligently; 5-8, Peter Whitmer Jr. is to accompany Oliver Cowdery on a mission to the Lamanites; 9-11, John Whitmer is called to preach the gospel.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have [[#^note-1a|feared]] man and have not [[#^note-1b|relied]] on me for strength as you ought. ^verse-1

**2**  But your mind has been on the things of the [[#^note-2a|earth]] more than on the things of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and you have not given heed unto my [[#^note-2b|Spirit]], and to those who were set over you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and [[#^note-3a|ponder]] upon the things which you have received. ^verse-3

**4**  And your home shall be at your [[#^note-4a|father's]] house, until I give unto you further commandments. And you shall attend to the [[#^note-4b|ministry]] in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I say unto you, Peter, that you shall take your [[#^note-5a|journey]] with your brother Oliver; for the [[#^note-5b|time]] has come that it is expedient in me that you shall open your mouth to declare my gospel; therefore, fear not, but give [[#^note-5c|heed]] unto the words and advice of your brother, which he shall give you. ^verse-5

**6**  And be you afflicted in all his [[#^note-6a|afflictions]], ever [[#^note-6b|lifting]] up your heart unto me in prayer and faith, for his and your [[#^note-6c|deliverance]]; for I have given unto him power to [[#^note-6d|build]] up my [[#^note-6e|church]] among the [[#^note-6f|Lamanites]]; ^verse-6

**7**  And none have I appointed to be his counselor [[#^note-7a|over]] him in the church, concerning church matters, except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall be blessed unto eternal life. Amen. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, I say unto you, my servant John, that thou shalt commence from this time forth to [[#^note-9a|proclaim]] my gospel, as with the [[#^note-9b|voice]] of a trump. ^verse-9

**10**  And your labor shall be at your brother Philip Burroughs', and in that region round about, yea, wherever you can be heard, until I command you to go from hence. ^verse-10

**11**  And your whole labor shall be in Zion, with all your soul, from henceforth; yea, you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not [[#^note-11a|fearing]] what [[#^note-11b|man]] can do, for I am [[#^note-11c|with]] you. Amen. ^verse-11
