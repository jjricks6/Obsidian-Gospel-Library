*1-6, The Prophet pleads with the Lord for the suffering Saints; 7-10, The Lord speaks peace to him; 11-17, Cursed are all those who raise false cries of transgression against the Lord's people; 18-25, They will not have right to the priesthood and will be damned; 26-32, Glorious revelations promised those who endure valiantly; 33-40, Why many are called and few are chosen; 41-46, The priesthood should be used only in righteousness.*

**1**  O God, [[#^note-1a|where]] art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy [[#^note-1b|hiding place]]? ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|How]] long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries? ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, O Lord, [[#^note-3a|how]] long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful [[#^note-3b|oppressions]], before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with [[#^note-3c|compassion]] toward them? ^verse-3

**4**  O Lord God [[#^note-4a|Almighty]], maker of [[#^note-4b|heaven]], earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol—stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy [[#^note-4c|pavilion]] be taken up; let thy [[#^note-4d|hiding place]] no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine [[#^note-4e|heart]] be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us. ^verse-4

**5**  Let thine [[#^note-5a|anger]] be kindled against our enemies; and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy [[#^note-5b|sword]] [[#^note-5c|avenge]] us of our wrongs. ^verse-5

**6**  Remember thy [[#^note-6a|suffering]] saints, O our God; and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever. ^verse-6

**7**  My son, [[#^note-7a|peace]] be unto thy soul; thine [[#^note-7b|adversity]] and thine afflictions shall be but a [[#^note-7c|small]] moment; ^verse-7

**8**  And then, if thou [[#^note-8a|endure]] it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy [[#^note-8b|foes]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Thy [[#^note-9a|friends]] do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou art not yet as Job; thy [[#^note-10a|friends]] do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job. ^verse-10

**11**  And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall [[#^note-11a|melt]] away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun; ^verse-11

**12**  And also that God hath set his hand and seal to change the [[#^note-12a|times]] and seasons, and to blind their [[#^note-12b|minds]], that they may not understand his [[#^note-12c|marvelous workings]]; that he may [[#^note-12d|prove]] them also and take them in their own craftiness; ^verse-12

**13**  Also because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon [[#^note-13a|themselves]] to the very uttermost; ^verse-13

**14**  That they may be [[#^note-14a|disappointed]] also, and their hopes may be cut off; ^verse-14

**15**  And not many years hence, that they and their [[#^note-15a|posterity]] shall be [[#^note-15b|swept]] from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall. ^verse-15

**16**  [[#^note-16a|Cursed]] are all those that shall lift up the [[#^note-16b|heel]] against mine [[#^note-16c|anointed]], saith the Lord, and cry they have [[#^note-16d|sinned]] when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them. ^verse-16

**17**  But [[#^note-17a|those]] who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the [[#^note-17b|children]] of disobedience themselves. ^verse-17

**18**  And those who [[#^note-18a|swear]] [[#^note-18b|falsely]] against my servants, that they might bring them into bondage and death— ^verse-18

**19**  Wo unto them; because they have [[#^note-19a|offended]] my little ones they shall be severed from the [[#^note-19b|ordinances]] of mine house. ^verse-19

**20**  Their [[#^note-20a|basket]] shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, and they themselves shall be [[#^note-20b|despised]] by those that flattered them. ^verse-20

**21**  They shall not have right to the [[#^note-21a|priesthood]], nor their posterity after them from generation to generation. ^verse-21

**22**  It had been [[#^note-22a|better]] for them that a millstone had been hanged about their necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea. ^verse-22

**23**  Wo unto all those that [[#^note-23a|discomfort]] my people, and drive, and [[#^note-23b|murder]], and testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a [[#^note-23c|generation]] of vipers shall not escape the damnation of hell. ^verse-23

**24**  Behold, mine eyes [[#^note-24a|see]] and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift [[#^note-24b|judgment]] in the season thereof, for them all; ^verse-24

**25**  For there is a [[#^note-25a|time]] [[#^note-25b|appointed]] for every man, according as his [[#^note-25c|works]] shall be. ^verse-25

**26**  God shall give unto you [[#^note-26a|knowledge]] by his [[#^note-26b|Holy Spirit]], yea, by the unspeakable [[#^note-26c|gift]] of the Holy Ghost, that has not been [[#^note-26d|revealed]] since the world was until now; ^verse-26

**27**  Which our forefathers have awaited with [[#^note-27a|anxious]] expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory; ^verse-27

**28**  A time to come in the which [[#^note-28a|nothing]] shall be withheld, whether there be [[#^note-28b|one God]] or many [[#^note-28c|gods]], they shall be manifest. ^verse-28

**29**  All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be [[#^note-29a|revealed]] and set forth upon all who have endured [[#^note-29b|valiantly]] for the gospel of Jesus Christ. ^verse-29

**30**  And also, if there be [[#^note-30a|bounds]] set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars— ^verse-30

**31**  All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their [[#^note-31a|glories]], laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the [[#^note-31b|dispensation]] of the fulness of times— ^verse-31

**32**  According to that which was [[#^note-32a|ordained]] in the midst of the [[#^note-32b|Council]] of the Eternal [[#^note-32c|God]] of all other gods before this [[#^note-32d|world]] was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternal [[#^note-32e|presence]] and into his immortal [[#^note-32f|rest]]. ^verse-32

**33**  How long can rolling waters remain impure? What [[#^note-33a|power]] shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to [[#^note-33b|hinder]] the [[#^note-33c|Almighty]] from pouring down [[#^note-33d|knowledge]] from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints. ^verse-33

**34**  Behold, there are many [[#^note-34a|called]], but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? ^verse-34

**35**  Because their [[#^note-35a|hearts]] are set so much upon the things of this [[#^note-35b|world]], and [[#^note-35c|aspire]] to the [[#^note-35d|honors]] of men, that they do not learn this one lesson— ^verse-35

**36**  That the [[#^note-36a|rights]] of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be [[#^note-36b|controlled]] nor handled only upon the [[#^note-36c|principles]] of righteousness. ^verse-36

**37**  That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to [[#^note-37a|cover]] our [[#^note-37b|sins]], or to gratify our [[#^note-37c|pride]], our vain ambition, or to exercise control or [[#^note-37d|dominion]] or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens [[#^note-37e|withdraw]] themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man. ^verse-37

**38**  Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to [[#^note-38a|kick]] against the pricks, to [[#^note-38b|persecute]] the saints, and to [[#^note-38c|fight]] against God. ^verse-38

**39**  We have learned by sad experience that it is the [[#^note-39a|nature]] and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little [[#^note-39b|authority]], as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise [[#^note-39c|unrighteous]] dominion. ^verse-39

**40**  Hence many are called, but [[#^note-40a|few]] are chosen. ^verse-40

**41**  No [[#^note-41a|power]] or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the [[#^note-41b|priesthood]], only by [[#^note-41c|persuasion]], by [[#^note-41d|long-suffering]], by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; ^verse-41

**42**  By [[#^note-42a|kindness]], and pure [[#^note-42b|knowledge]], which shall greatly enlarge the [[#^note-42c|soul]] without [[#^note-42d|hypocrisy]], and without [[#^note-42e|guile]]— ^verse-42

**43**  [[#^note-43a|Reproving]] betimes with [[#^note-43b|sharpness]], when [[#^note-43c|moved]] upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of [[#^note-43d|love]] toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; ^verse-43

**44**  That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of [[#^note-44a|death]]. ^verse-44

**45**  Let thy [[#^note-45a|bowels]] also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let [[#^note-45b|virtue]] garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy [[#^note-45c|confidence]] wax strong in the [[#^note-45d|presence]] of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the [[#^note-45e|dews]] from heaven. ^verse-45

**46**  The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant [[#^note-46a|companion]], and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of [[#^note-46b|righteousness]] and truth; and thy [[#^note-46c|dominion]] shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever. ^verse-46
