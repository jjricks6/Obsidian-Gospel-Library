*1-5, The keys of the kingdom are committed to Joseph Smith and through him to the Church; 6-7, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams are to serve in the First Presidency; 8-11, The gospel is to be preached to the nations of Israel, to the Gentiles, and to the Jews, every man hearing in his own tongue; 12-18, Joseph Smith and his counselors are to set the Church in order; 19-37, Various individuals are counseled by the Lord to walk uprightly and serve in His kingdom.*

**1**  Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto you my son, thy sins are [[#^note-1a|forgiven]] thee, according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears. ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore, thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the [[#^note-2a|keys]] of the [[#^note-2b|kingdom]] given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the last time. ^verse-2

**3**  Verily I say unto you, the keys of this [[#^note-3a|kingdom]] shall [[#^note-3b|never]] be taken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world to come; ^verse-3

**4**  Nevertheless, through you shall the [[#^note-4a|oracles]] be given to another, yea, even unto the church. ^verse-4

**5**  And all they who receive the [[#^note-5a|oracles]] of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the [[#^note-5b|rains]] descend, and beat upon their house. ^verse-5

**6**  And again, verily I say unto thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and [[#^note-6a|Frederick G. Williams]], their sins are forgiven them also, and they are accounted as [[#^note-6b|equal]] with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom; ^verse-6

**7**  As also through your administration the keys of the [[#^note-7a|school]] of the prophets, which I have commanded to be organized; ^verse-7

**8**  That thereby they may be [[#^note-8a|perfected]] in their ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will believe; ^verse-8

**9**  That through your administration they may receive the word, and through their administration the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the [[#^note-9a|Gentiles]] [[#^note-9b|first]], and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto the Jews. ^verse-9

**10**  And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be [[#^note-10a|revealed]] in power in convincing the nations, the [[#^note-10b|heathen]] nations, the house of [[#^note-10c|Joseph]], of the gospel of their salvation. ^verse-10

**11**  For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall [[#^note-11a|hear]] the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own [[#^note-11b|language]], through those who are [[#^note-11c|ordained]] unto this [[#^note-11d|power]], by the administration of the [[#^note-11e|Comforter]], shed forth upon them for the [[#^note-11f|revelation]] of Jesus Christ. ^verse-11

**12**  And now, verily I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment that you continue in the [[#^note-12a|ministry]] and presidency. ^verse-12

**13**  And when you have finished the [[#^note-13a|translation]] of the prophets, you shall from thenceforth [[#^note-13b|preside]] over the affairs of the church and the school; ^verse-13

**14**  And from time to time, as shall be manifested by the Comforter, receive [[#^note-14a|revelations]] to unfold the [[#^note-14b|mysteries]] of the kingdom; ^verse-14

**15**  And set in order the churches, and [[#^note-15a|study]] and [[#^note-15b|learn]], and become acquainted with all good books, and with [[#^note-15c|languages]], tongues, and people. ^verse-15

**16**  And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside in council, and set in [[#^note-16a|order]] all the affairs of this church and kingdom. ^verse-16

**17**  Be not [[#^note-17a|ashamed]], neither confounded; but be admonished in all your high-mindedness and [[#^note-17b|pride]], for it bringeth a snare upon your souls. ^verse-17

**18**  Set in [[#^note-18a|order]] your houses; keep [[#^note-18b|slothfulness]] and [[#^note-18c|uncleanness]] far from you. ^verse-18

**19**  Now, verily I say unto you, let there be a [[#^note-19a|place]] provided, as soon as it is possible, for the family of thy counselor and scribe, even Frederick G. Williams. ^verse-19

**20**  And let mine aged servant, [[#^note-20a|Joseph Smith, Sen.]], continue with his family upon the place where he now lives; and let it not be sold until the mouth of the Lord shall name. ^verse-20

**21**  And let my counselor, even [[#^note-21a|Sidney Rigdon]], remain where he now resides until the mouth of the Lord shall name. ^verse-21

**22**  And let the bishop search diligently to obtain an [[#^note-22a|agent]], and let him be a man who has got [[#^note-22b|riches]] in store—a man of God, and of strong faith— ^verse-22

**23**  That thereby he may be enabled to discharge every debt; that the storehouse of the Lord may not be brought into disrepute before the eyes of the people. ^verse-23

**24**  Search [[#^note-24a|diligently]], [[#^note-24b|pray]] always, and be believing, and [[#^note-24c|all]] things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the [[#^note-24d|covenant]] wherewith ye have covenanted one with another. ^verse-24

**25**  Let your families be [[#^note-25a|small]], especially mine aged servant Joseph Smith's, Sen., as pertaining to those who do not belong to your families; ^verse-25

**26**  That those things that are provided for you, to bring to pass my work, be not taken from you and given to those that are not worthy— ^verse-26

**27**  And thereby you be hindered in accomplishing those things which I have commanded you. ^verse-27

**28**  And again, verily I say unto you, it is my will that my handmaid Vienna Jaques should receive [[#^note-28a|money]] to bear her expenses, and go up unto the land of Zion; ^verse-28

**29**  And the residue of the money may be consecrated unto me, and she be rewarded in mine own due time. ^verse-29

**30**  Verily I say unto you, that it is meet in mine eyes that she should go up unto the land of Zion, and receive an [[#^note-30a|inheritance]] from the hand of the bishop; ^verse-30

**31**  That she may settle down in peace inasmuch as she is faithful, and not be idle in her days from thenceforth. ^verse-31

**32**  And behold, verily I say unto you, that ye shall [[#^note-32a|write]] this commandment, and say unto your brethren in Zion, in love greeting, that I have called you also to [[#^note-32b|preside]] over Zion in mine own due time. ^verse-32

**33**  Therefore, let them cease wearying me concerning this matter. ^verse-33

**34**  Behold, I say unto you that your brethren in Zion begin to repent, and the angels rejoice over them. ^verse-34

**35**  Nevertheless, I am not well pleased with many things; and I am not well pleased with my servant [[#^note-35a|William E. McLellin]], neither with my servant Sidney Gilbert; and the bishop also, and others have many things to repent of. ^verse-35

**36**  But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with [[#^note-36a|Zion]], and plead with her strong ones, and [[#^note-36b|chasten]] her until she overcomes and is [[#^note-36c|clean]] before me. ^verse-36

**37**  For she shall not be removed out of her place. I, the Lord, have spoken it. Amen. ^verse-37
