*1-6, Laborers in the vineyard will gain salvation; 7-14, Seek wisdom, cry repentance, trust in the Spirit; 15-22, Keep the commandments, and study the Lord's word; 23-27, Deny not the spirit of revelation and of prophecy; 28-30, Those who receive Christ become the sons of God.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|A]] great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I am God; give [[#^note-2a|heed]] to my [[#^note-2b|word]], which is quick and [[#^note-2c|powerful]], [[#^note-2d|sharper]] than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give [[#^note-2e|heed]] unto my word. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, the field is [[#^note-3a|white]] already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his [[#^note-3b|might]], and reap while the day lasts, that he may [[#^note-3c|treasure]] up for his soul [[#^note-3d|everlasting]] salvation in the kingdom of God. ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and [[#^note-4a|reap]], the same is [[#^note-4b|called]] of God. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will [[#^note-5a|knock]] it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-5

**6**  Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of [[#^note-6a|Zion]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Seek not for [[#^note-7a|riches]] but for [[#^note-7b|wisdom]]; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made [[#^note-7c|rich]]. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich. ^verse-7

**8**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done unto you; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation. ^verse-8

**9**  [[#^note-9a|Say]] nothing but [[#^note-9b|repentance]] unto this generation. Keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my [[#^note-9c|work]], [[#^note-9d|according]] to my commandments, and you shall be blessed. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold, thou hast a [[#^note-10a|gift]], or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire of me in faith, with an [[#^note-10b|honest]] heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, or in my power which speaketh unto thee; ^verse-10

**11**  For, behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the [[#^note-11a|light]] which shineth in darkness, and by my [[#^note-11b|power]] I give these words unto thee. ^verse-11

**12**  And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your [[#^note-12a|trust]] in that [[#^note-12b|Spirit]] which [[#^note-12c|leadeth]] to do [[#^note-12d|good]]—yea, to do [[#^note-12e|justly]], to walk [[#^note-12f|humbly]], to [[#^note-12g|judge]] righteously; and this is my Spirit. ^verse-12

**13**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall [[#^note-13a|enlighten]] your [[#^note-13b|mind]], which shall fill your soul with [[#^note-13c|joy]]; ^verse-13

**14**  And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of [[#^note-14a|righteousness]], in faith believing in me that you shall receive. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, I command you that you need not suppose that you are [[#^note-15a|called]] to [[#^note-15b|preach]] [[#^note-15c|until]] you are called. ^verse-15

**16**  Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my [[#^note-16a|rock]], my [[#^note-16b|church]], and my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine. ^verse-16

**17**  And then, behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your [[#^note-17a|faith]] shall it be done unto you. ^verse-17

**18**  Keep my commandments; hold your peace; appeal unto my Spirit; ^verse-18

**19**  Yea, [[#^note-19a|cleave]] unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing to light those things of which has been spoken—yea, the [[#^note-19b|translation]] of my work; be patient until you shall accomplish it. ^verse-19

**20**  Behold, this is your work, to [[#^note-20a|keep]] my commandments, yea, with all your might, [[#^note-20b|mind]] and strength. ^verse-20

**21**  Seek not to [[#^note-21a|declare]] my word, but first seek to [[#^note-21b|obtain]] my [[#^note-21c|word]], and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my [[#^note-21d|Spirit]] and my word, yea, the power of God unto the [[#^note-21e|convincing]] of men. ^verse-21

**22**  But now hold your [[#^note-22a|peace]]; study [[#^note-22b|my word]] which hath gone forth among the children of men, and also [[#^note-22c|study]] my word which shall come forth among the children of men, or that which is [[#^note-22d|now translating]], yea, until you have obtained all which I shall [[#^note-22e|grant]] unto the children of men in this generation, and then shall all things be added thereto. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold thou art [[#^note-23a|Hyrum]], my son; [[#^note-23b|seek]] the kingdom of God, and all things shall be added according to that which is just. ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Build]] upon my [[#^note-24b|rock]], which is my [[#^note-24c|gospel]]; ^verse-24

**25**  Deny not the spirit of [[#^note-25a|revelation]], nor the spirit of [[#^note-25b|prophecy]], for wo unto him that [[#^note-25c|denieth]] these things; ^verse-25

**26**  Therefore, [[#^note-26a|treasure]] up in your [[#^note-26b|heart]] until the time which is in my wisdom that you shall go forth. ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, I speak unto [[#^note-27a|all]] who have good desires, and have thrust in their sickle to reap. ^verse-27

**28**  Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the [[#^note-28a|Son of God]]. I am the life and the [[#^note-28b|light]] of the world. ^verse-28

**29**  I am the same who came unto mine own and mine own [[#^note-29a|received me not]]; ^verse-29

**30**  But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will I give [[#^note-30a|power]] to become the [[#^note-30b|sons]] of God, even to them that [[#^note-30c|believe]] on my name. Amen. ^verse-30
