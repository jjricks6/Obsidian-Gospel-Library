*1-4, Where much is given, much is required; 5-7, Darkness reigns in the world; 8-13, The Lord is bound when we do what He says; 14-18, Zion must increase in beauty and holiness; 19-24, Every man should seek the interest of his neighbor.*

**1**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have [[#^note-1a|forgiven]] one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you. ^verse-1

**2**  Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even [[#^note-2a|all]] of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and [[#^note-2b|refrain]] from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads. ^verse-2

**3**  For of him unto whom [[#^note-3a|much]] is [[#^note-3b|given]] much is [[#^note-3c|required]]; and he who [[#^note-3d|sins]] against the greater [[#^note-3e|light]] shall [[#^note-3f|receive]] the greater [[#^note-3g|condemnation]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Ye call upon my name for [[#^note-4a|revelations]], and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and [[#^note-4b|justice]] and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all: [[#^note-5a|Watch]], for the [[#^note-5b|adversary]] [[#^note-5c|spreadeth]] his dominions, and [[#^note-5d|darkness]] reigneth; ^verse-5

**6**  And the anger of God kindleth against the inhabitants of the earth; and [[#^note-6a|none]] doeth good, for all have gone out of the [[#^note-6b|way]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, will not lay any [[#^note-7a|sin]] to your charge; go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall the [[#^note-7b|former]] sins return, saith the Lord your God. ^verse-7

**8**  And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a [[#^note-8a|new]] commandment, that you may understand my will concerning you; ^verse-8

**9**  Or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may [[#^note-9a|act]] before me, that it may [[#^note-9b|turn]] to you for your salvation. ^verse-9

**10**  I, the Lord, am [[#^note-10a|bound]] when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no [[#^note-10b|promise]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servants Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney, A. Sidney Gilbert and Sidney Rigdon, and my servant Joseph Smith, and John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, and W. W. Phelps and Martin Harris to be bound [[#^note-11a|together]] by a bond and covenant that cannot be [[#^note-11b|broken]] by transgression, except judgment shall immediately follow, in your several [[#^note-11c|stewardships]]— ^verse-11

**12**  To manage the affairs of the poor, and all things pertaining to the bishopric [[#^note-12a|both]] in the land of Zion and in the land of Kirtland; ^verse-12

**13**  For I have consecrated the land of Kirtland in mine own due time for the benefit of the saints of the Most High, and for a [[#^note-13a|stake]] to Zion. ^verse-13

**14**  For [[#^note-14a|Zion]] must increase in [[#^note-14b|beauty]], and in [[#^note-14c|holiness]]; her borders must be enlarged; her [[#^note-14d|stakes]] must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must [[#^note-14e|arise]] and put on her [[#^note-14f|beautiful garments]]. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore, I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, here is [[#^note-16a|wisdom]] also in me for your good. ^verse-16

**17**  And you are to be [[#^note-17a|equal]], or in other words, you are to have equal [[#^note-17b|claims]] on the [[#^note-17c|properties]], for the benefit of [[#^note-17d|managing]] the concerns of your stewardships, every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just— ^verse-17

**18**  And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may [[#^note-18a|improve]] upon his [[#^note-18b|talent]], that every man may [[#^note-18c|gain]] other [[#^note-18d|talents]], yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's [[#^note-18e|storehouse]], to become the common [[#^note-18f|property]] of the whole church— ^verse-18

**19**  [[#^note-19a|Every]] man seeking the interest of his [[#^note-19b|neighbor]], and doing all things with an [[#^note-19c|eye]] single to the glory of God. ^verse-19

**20**  This order I have appointed to be an [[#^note-20a|everlasting]] [[#^note-20b|order]] unto you, and unto your successors, inasmuch as you sin not. ^verse-20

**21**  And the soul that sins against this covenant, and [[#^note-21a|hardeneth]] his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws of my church, and shall be delivered over to the [[#^note-21b|buffetings]] of Satan until the day of redemption. ^verse-21

**22**  And now, verily I say unto you, and this is wisdom, make unto yourselves friends with the [[#^note-22a|mammon]] of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you. ^verse-22

**23**  Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will [[#^note-23a|repay]]. Peace be with you; my blessings continue with you. ^verse-23

**24**  For even yet the [[#^note-24a|kingdom]] is yours, and shall be forever, if you fall not from your [[#^note-24b|steadfastness]]. Even so. Amen. ^verse-24
