*1-6, The Prophet sees his brother Alvin in the celestial kingdom; 7-9, The doctrine of salvation for the dead is revealed; 10, All children are saved in the celestial kingdom.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|heavens]] were [[#^note-1b|opened]] upon us, and I beheld the [[#^note-1c|celestial]] kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the [[#^note-1d|body]] or out I cannot tell. ^verse-1

**2**  I saw the transcendent [[#^note-2a|beauty]] of the [[#^note-2b|gate]] through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was [[#^note-2c|like]] unto [[#^note-2d|circling]] flames of fire; ^verse-2

**3**  Also the [[#^note-3a|blazing]] [[#^note-3b|throne]] of God, whereon was seated the [[#^note-3c|Father]] and the [[#^note-3d|Son]]. ^verse-3

**4**  I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with [[#^note-4a|gold]]. ^verse-4

**5**  I saw Father [[#^note-5a|Adam]] and [[#^note-5b|Abraham]]; and my [[#^note-5c|father]] and my mother; my brother [[#^note-5d|Alvin]], that has long since [[#^note-5e|slept]]; ^verse-5

**6**  And [[#^note-6a|marveled]] how it was that he had obtained an [[#^note-6b|inheritance]] in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand to [[#^note-6c|gather]] Israel the second time, and had not been [[#^note-6d|baptized]] for the remission of sins. ^verse-6

**7**  Thus came the [[#^note-7a|voice]] of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died [[#^note-7b|without]] a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be [[#^note-7c|heirs]] of the celestial kingdom of God; ^verse-7

**8**  Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who [[#^note-8a|would]] have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom; ^verse-8

**9**  For I, the Lord, will [[#^note-9a|judge]] all men according to their [[#^note-9b|works]], according to the [[#^note-9c|desire]] of their hearts. ^verse-9

**10**  And I also beheld that all [[#^note-10a|children]] who die before they arrive at the [[#^note-10b|years]] of accountability are [[#^note-10c|saved]] in the celestial kingdom of heaven. ^verse-10
