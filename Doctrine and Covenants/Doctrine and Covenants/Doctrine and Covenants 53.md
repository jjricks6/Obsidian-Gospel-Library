*1-3, Sidney Gilbert's calling and election in the Church is to be ordained an elder; 4-7, He is also to serve as a bishop's agent.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you, my servant Sidney Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you have called upon me that it should be made known unto you, of the Lord your God, concerning your [[#^note-1a|calling]] and [[#^note-1b|election]] in the church, which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I, the Lord, who was [[#^note-2a|crucified]] for the sins of the world, give unto you a commandment that you shall [[#^note-2b|forsake]] the world. ^verse-2

**3**  Take upon you mine ordination, even that of an elder, to preach faith and repentance and [[#^note-3a|remission]] of sins, according to my word, and the reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of [[#^note-3b|hands]]; ^verse-3

**4**  And also to be an [[#^note-4a|agent]] unto this church in the place which shall be appointed by the bishop, according to commandments which shall be given hereafter. ^verse-4

**5**  And again, verily I say unto you, you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, these are the first ordinances which you shall receive; and the residue shall be made known in a time to come, according to your labor in my vineyard. ^verse-6

**7**  And again, I would that ye should learn that he only is saved who [[#^note-7a|endureth]] unto the end. Even so. Amen. ^verse-7
