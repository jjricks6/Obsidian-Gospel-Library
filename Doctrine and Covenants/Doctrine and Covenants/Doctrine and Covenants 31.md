*1-6, Thomas B. Marsh is called to preach the gospel and is assured of his family's well-being; 7-13, He is counseled to be patient, pray always, and follow the Comforter.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Thomas]], my son, blessed are you because of your faith in my work. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your [[#^note-2a|family]]; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church. ^verse-2

**3**  Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare [[#^note-3a|glad]] tidings of great joy unto this generation. ^verse-3

**4**  You shall [[#^note-4a|declare]] the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun. You shall begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap in the field which is [[#^note-4b|white]] already to be burned. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, [[#^note-5a|thrust]] in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are [[#^note-5b|forgiven]] you, and you shall be laden with [[#^note-5c|sheaves]] upon your back, for the [[#^note-5d|laborer]] is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, verily I say unto you, go from them only for a little [[#^note-6a|time]], and declare my word, and I will prepare a place for them. ^verse-6

**7**  Yea, I will [[#^note-7a|open]] the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand; ^verse-7

**8**  And you shall [[#^note-8a|strengthen]] them and prepare them against the time when they shall be gathered. ^verse-8

**9**  Be [[#^note-9a|patient]] in [[#^note-9b|afflictions]], [[#^note-9c|revile]] not against those that revile. Govern your [[#^note-9d|house]] in meekness, and be [[#^note-9e|steadfast]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for they will not receive you. ^verse-10

**11**  Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the [[#^note-11a|Comforter]] what you shall do and whither you shall go. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Pray]] always, lest you enter into [[#^note-12b|temptation]] and lose your [[#^note-12c|reward]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Be [[#^note-13a|faithful]] unto the [[#^note-13b|end]], and lo, I am [[#^note-13c|with]] you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the [[#^note-13d|will]] of the Father. Amen. ^verse-13
