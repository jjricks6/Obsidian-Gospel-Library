*1-4, Jared Carter is called to preach the gospel by the Comforter.*

**1**  Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that my servant Jared Carter should go again into the eastern countries, from place to place, and from city to city, in the power of the [[#^note-1a|ordination]] wherewith he has been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the [[#^note-1b|everlasting gospel]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And I will send upon him the [[#^note-2a|Comforter]], which shall teach him the truth and the [[#^note-2b|way]] whither he shall go; ^verse-2

**3**  And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will crown him again with [[#^note-3a|sheaves]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, let your heart be glad, my servant Jared Carter, and [[#^note-4a|fear not]], saith your Lord, even Jesus Christ. Amen. ^verse-4
