*1-7, These early disciples are called to preach, exhort, and strengthen the Church.*

**1**  Behold, I speak unto you, Oliver, a few words. Behold, thou art blessed, and art under no condemnation. But beware of [[#^note-1a|pride]], lest thou shouldst enter into [[#^note-1b|temptation]]. ^verse-1

**2**  Make known thy calling unto the church, and also before the [[#^note-2a|world]], and thy heart shall be opened to preach the truth from henceforth and forever. Amen. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue [[#^note-3a|loosed]]; and thy calling is to exhortation, and to [[#^note-3b|strengthen]] the church continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family. Amen. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I speak a few words unto you, [[#^note-4a|Samuel]]; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and thou art not as yet called to preach before the world. Amen. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Joseph; for thou also art under no [[#^note-5a|condemnation]], and thy calling also is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and this is thy duty from henceforth and forever. Amen. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I manifest unto you, Joseph Knight, by these words, that you must take up your [[#^note-6a|cross]], in the which you must [[#^note-6b|pray]] [[#^note-6c|vocally]] before the world as well as in secret, and in your family, and among your friends, and in all places. ^verse-6

**7**  And, behold, it is your duty to unite with the true [[#^note-7a|church]], and give your language to exhortation continually, that you may receive the reward of the [[#^note-7b|laborer]]. Amen. ^verse-7
