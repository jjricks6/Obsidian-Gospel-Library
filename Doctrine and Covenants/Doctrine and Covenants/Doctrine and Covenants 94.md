*1-9, The Lord gives a commandment relative to the erection of a house for the work of the Presidency; 10-12, A printing house is to be built; 13-17, Certain inheritances are assigned.*

**1**    And again, verily I say unto you, my [[#^note-1a|friends]], a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and foundation of the city of the [[#^note-1b|stake]] of Zion, here in the land of Kirtland, beginning at my house. ^verse-1

**2**  And behold, it must be done according to the [[#^note-2a|pattern]] which I have given unto you. ^verse-2

**3**  And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the [[#^note-3a|presidency]], for the work of the presidency, in obtaining revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom. ^verse-3

**4**  Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court. ^verse-4

**5**  And there shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter. ^verse-5

**6**  And it shall be [[#^note-6a|dedicated]] unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, according to the [[#^note-6b|order]] of the priesthood, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter. ^verse-6

**7**  And it shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the [[#^note-7a|presidency]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And ye shall not suffer any [[#^note-8a|unclean thing]] to come in unto it; and my [[#^note-8b|glory]] shall be there, and my [[#^note-8c|presence]] shall be there. ^verse-8

**9**  But if there shall come into it any [[#^note-9a|unclean thing]], my glory shall not be there; and my presence shall not come into it. ^verse-9

**10**  And again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of the [[#^note-10a|printing]] of the [[#^note-10b|translation of my scriptures]], and all things whatsoever I shall command you. ^verse-10

**11**  And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a higher court. ^verse-11

**12**  And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all things as it shall be given unto you. ^verse-12

**13**  And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his [[#^note-13a|inheritance]]. ^verse-13

**14**  And on the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter receive their inheritancesâ€” ^verse-14

**15**  That they may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a committee to build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord God, have given unto you. ^verse-15

**16**  These two houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment concerning them. ^verse-16

**17**  And now I give unto you no more at this time. Amen. ^verse-17
