*1, Baptism is a new and everlasting covenant; 2-4, Authoritative baptism is required.*

**1**  Beh[[#^note-1a|old]], I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing; and this is a [[#^note-1b|new]] and an everlasting [[#^note-1c|covenant]], even that which was from the beginning. ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times it availeth him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the [[#^note-2a|law]] of Moses, neither by your [[#^note-2b|dead works]]. ^verse-2

**3**  For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, enter ye in at the [[#^note-4a|gate]], as I have commanded, and [[#^note-4b|seek]] not to counsel your God. Amen. ^verse-4
