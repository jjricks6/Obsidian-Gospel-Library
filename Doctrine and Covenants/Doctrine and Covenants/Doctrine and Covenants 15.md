**2**  For behold, I speak unto you with [[#^note-2a|sharpness]] and with power, for mine arm is over all the [[#^note-2b|earth]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And I will [[#^note-3a|tell]] you that which no man [[#^note-3b|knoweth]] save me and thee aloneâ€” ^verse-3

**5**  Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which I have given you according to my commandments. ^verse-5

**6**  And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to [[#^note-6a|declare]] [[#^note-6b|repentance]] unto this people, that you may bring [[#^note-6c|souls]] unto me, that you may [[#^note-6d|rest]] with them in the [[#^note-6e|kingdom]] of my [[#^note-6f|Father]]. Amen. ^verse-6
