**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you who have assembled yourselves together to receive his will concerning you: ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the angels [[#^note-2a|rejoice]] over you; the [[#^note-2b|alms]] of your prayers have come up into the ears of the Lord of [[#^note-2c|Sabaoth]], and are recorded in the [[#^note-2d|book]] of the names of the sanctified, even them of the celestial world. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, I now send upon you another [[#^note-3a|Comforter]], even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of [[#^note-3b|promise]]; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of John. ^verse-3

**4**  This Comforter is the [[#^note-4a|promise]] which I give unto you of [[#^note-4b|eternal life]], even the [[#^note-4c|glory]] of the celestial kingdom; ^verse-4

**5**  Which glory is that of the church of the [[#^note-5a|Firstborn]], even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus Christ his Son— ^verse-5

**6**  He that [[#^note-6a|ascended]] up on high, as also he [[#^note-6b|descended]] below all things, in that he [[#^note-6c|comprehended]] all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the [[#^note-6d|light]] of truth; ^verse-6

**7**  Which truth shineth. This is the [[#^note-7a|light of Christ]]. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was [[#^note-7b|made]]. ^verse-7

**8**  As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made; ^verse-8

**9**  As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were made; ^verse-9

**10**  And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you [[#^note-10a|stand]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your [[#^note-11a|understandings]]; ^verse-11

**12**  Which [[#^note-12a|light]] proceedeth forth from the presence of God to [[#^note-12b|fill]] the immensity of space— ^verse-12

**13**  The [[#^note-13a|light]] which is in all things, which giveth [[#^note-13b|life]] to all things, which is the [[#^note-13c|law]] by which all things are governed, even the [[#^note-13d|power]] of God who [[#^note-13e|sitteth]] upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things. ^verse-13

**14**  Now, verily I say unto you, that through the [[#^note-14a|redemption]] which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|spirit]] and the [[#^note-15b|body]] are the [[#^note-15c|soul]] of man. ^verse-15

**16**  And the [[#^note-16a|resurrection]] from the dead is the redemption of the soul. ^verse-16

**17**  And the redemption of the soul is through him that [[#^note-17a|quickeneth]] all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the [[#^note-17b|poor]] and the [[#^note-17c|meek]] of the [[#^note-17d|earth]] shall inherit it. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore, it must needs be [[#^note-18a|sanctified]] from all [[#^note-18b|unrighteousness]], that it may be prepared for the [[#^note-18c|celestial]] glory; ^verse-18

**19**  For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with [[#^note-19a|glory]], even with the presence of God the Father; ^verse-19

**20**  That bodies who are of the [[#^note-20a|celestial]] kingdom may [[#^note-20b|possess]] it forever and ever; for, for this [[#^note-20c|intent]] was it made and created, and for this intent are they [[#^note-20d|sanctified]]. ^verse-20

**21**  And they who are not [[#^note-21a|sanctified]] through the [[#^note-21b|law]] which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit [[#^note-21c|another]] kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom. ^verse-21

**22**  For he who is not able to abide the [[#^note-22a|law]] of a celestial kingdom cannot [[#^note-22b|abide]] a [[#^note-22c|celestial]] glory. ^verse-22

**23**  And he who cannot abide the law of a [[#^note-23a|terrestrial]] kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory. ^verse-23

**24**  And he who cannot abide the law of a [[#^note-24a|telestial]] [[#^note-24b|kingdom]] cannot abide a telestial [[#^note-24c|glory]]; therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory. ^verse-24

**25**  And again, verily I say unto you, the [[#^note-25a|earth]] abideth the law of a celestial kingdom, for it filleth the [[#^note-25b|measure]] of its creation, and transgresseth not the law— ^verse-25

**26**  Wherefore, it shall be [[#^note-26a|sanctified]]; yea, notwithstanding it shall [[#^note-26b|die]], it shall be [[#^note-26c|quickened]] again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, and the [[#^note-26d|righteous]] shall [[#^note-26e|inherit]] it. ^verse-26

**27**  For notwithstanding they die, they also shall [[#^note-27a|rise]] again, a [[#^note-27b|spiritual body]]. ^verse-27

**28**  They who are of a celestial [[#^note-28a|spirit]] shall receive the same [[#^note-28b|body]] which was a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your [[#^note-28c|glory]] shall be that glory by which your bodies are [[#^note-28d|quickened]]. ^verse-28

**29**  Ye who are [[#^note-29a|quickened]] by a portion of the [[#^note-29b|celestial]] glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness. ^verse-29

**30**  And they who are quickened by a portion of the [[#^note-30a|terrestrial]] glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness. ^verse-30

**31**  And also they who are quickened by a portion of the [[#^note-31a|telestial]] glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness. ^verse-31

**32**  And they who remain shall also be [[#^note-32a|quickened]]; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are [[#^note-32b|willing]] to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received. ^verse-32

**33**  For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift. ^verse-33

**34**  And again, verily I say unto you, that which is [[#^note-34a|governed]] by law is also preserved by law and perfected and [[#^note-34b|sanctified]] by the same. ^verse-34

**35**  That which [[#^note-35a|breaketh]] a law, and [[#^note-35b|abideth not]] by [[#^note-35c|law]], but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, [[#^note-35d|justice]], nor [[#^note-35e|judgment]]. Therefore, they must remain [[#^note-35f|filthy]] still. ^verse-35

**36**  All kingdoms have a law given; ^verse-36

**37**  And there are many [[#^note-37a|kingdoms]]; for there is no [[#^note-37b|space]] in the which there is no [[#^note-37c|kingdom]]; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom. ^verse-37

**38**  And unto every kingdom is given a [[#^note-38a|law]]; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions. ^verse-38

**39**  All beings who abide not in those [[#^note-39a|conditions]] are not [[#^note-39b|justified]]. ^verse-39

**40**  For [[#^note-40a|intelligence]] cleaveth unto intelligence; [[#^note-40b|wisdom]] receiveth wisdom; [[#^note-40c|truth]] embraceth truth; [[#^note-40d|virtue]] loveth virtue; [[#^note-40e|light]] cleaveth unto light; [[#^note-40f|mercy]] hath [[#^note-40g|compassion]] on mercy and claimeth her own; [[#^note-40h|justice]] continueth its course and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things. ^verse-40

**41**  He [[#^note-41a|comprehendeth]] all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever. ^verse-41

**42**  And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a [[#^note-42a|law]] unto all things, by which they move in their [[#^note-42b|times]] and their seasons; ^verse-42

**43**  And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets. ^verse-43

**44**  And they give [[#^note-44a|light]] to each other in their times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in their years—all these are [[#^note-44b|one]] year with God, but not with man. ^verse-44

**45**  The earth [[#^note-45a|rolls]] upon her wings, and the [[#^note-45b|sun]] giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the [[#^note-45c|power]] of God. ^verse-45

**46**  Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand? ^verse-46

**47**  Behold, all these are [[#^note-47a|kingdoms]], and any man who hath [[#^note-47b|seen]] any or the least of these hath [[#^note-47c|seen]] God [[#^note-47d|moving]] in his majesty and power. ^verse-47

**48**  I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his [[#^note-48a|own]] was not comprehended. ^verse-48

**49**  The [[#^note-49a|light]] shineth in darkness, and the darkness [[#^note-49b|comprehend]]eth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him. ^verse-49

**50**  Then shall ye know that ye have [[#^note-50a|seen]] me, that I am, and that I am the true [[#^note-50b|light]] that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not abound. ^verse-50

**51**  Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he sent forth his servants into the field to dig in the field. ^verse-51

**52**  And he said unto the first: Go ye and labor in the field, and in the first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance. ^verse-52

**53**  And he said unto the second: Go ye also into the field, and in the second hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance. ^verse-53

**54**  And also unto the third, saying: I will visit you; ^verse-54

**55**  And unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth. ^verse-55

**56**  And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance of his lord. ^verse-56

**57**  And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also, and the third, and the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth. ^verse-57

**58**  And thus they all received the light of the countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and in his season— ^verse-58

**59**  Beginning at the first, and so on unto the [[#^note-59a|last]], and from the last unto the first, and from the first unto the last; ^verse-59

**60**  Every man in his own [[#^note-60a|order]], until his hour was finished, even according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified. ^verse-60

**61**  Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all these [[#^note-61a|kingdoms]], and the [[#^note-61b|inhabitants]] thereof—every kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in its season, even according to the decree which God hath made. ^verse-61

**62**  And again, verily I say unto you, my [[#^note-62a|friends]], I leave these [[#^note-62b|sayings]] with you to [[#^note-62c|ponder]] in your hearts, with this commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall [[#^note-62d|call]] upon me while I am near— ^verse-62

**63**  [[#^note-63a|Draw]] [[#^note-63b|near]] unto me and I will draw near unto you; [[#^note-63c|seek]] me diligently and ye shall [[#^note-63d|find]] me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-63

**64**  Whatsoever ye [[#^note-64a|ask]] the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is [[#^note-64b|expedient]] for you; ^verse-64

**65**  And if ye ask anything that is not [[#^note-65a|expedient]] for you, it shall turn unto your [[#^note-65b|condemnation]]. ^verse-65

**66**  Behold, that which you hear is as the [[#^note-66a|voice]] of one crying in the wilderness—in the wilderness, because you cannot see him—my voice, because my voice is [[#^note-66b|Spirit]]; my Spirit is [[#^note-66c|truth]]; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound. ^verse-66

**67**  And if your eye be [[#^note-67a|single]] to my [[#^note-67b|glory]], your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light [[#^note-67c|comprehendeth]] all things. ^verse-67

**68**  Therefore, [[#^note-68a|sanctify]] yourselves that your [[#^note-68b|minds]] become [[#^note-68c|single]] to God, and the days will come that you shall [[#^note-68d|see]] him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will. ^verse-68

**69**  Remember the great and last promise which I have made unto you; cast away your [[#^note-69a|idle]] thoughts and your [[#^note-69b|excess]] of [[#^note-69c|laughter]] far from you. ^verse-69

**70**  Tarry ye, tarry ye in this place, and call a [[#^note-70a|solemn assembly]], even of those who are the first [[#^note-70b|laborers]] in this last kingdom. ^verse-70

**71**  And let those whom they have warned in their traveling call on the Lord, and [[#^note-71a|ponder]] the [[#^note-71b|warning]] in their hearts which they have received, for a little season. ^verse-71

**72**  Behold, and lo, I will take care of your [[#^note-72a|flocks]], and will raise up elders and send unto them. ^verse-72

**73**  Behold, I will [[#^note-73a|hasten]] my work in its time. ^verse-73

**74**  And I give unto you, who are the first [[#^note-74a|laborers]] in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and [[#^note-74b|sanctify]] yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and [[#^note-74c|cleanse]] your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you [[#^note-74d|clean]]; ^verse-74

**75**  That I may testify unto your [[#^note-75a|Father]], and your [[#^note-75b|God]], and my God, that you are clean from the [[#^note-75c|blood]] of this wicked generation; that I may fulfil this [[#^note-75d|promise]], this great and last promise, which I have made unto you, when I will. ^verse-75

**76**  Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in [[#^note-76a|prayer]] and fasting from this time forth. ^verse-76

**77**  And I give unto you a commandment that you shall [[#^note-77a|teach]] one another the [[#^note-77b|doctrine]] of the kingdom. ^verse-77

**78**  Teach ye diligently and my [[#^note-78a|grace]] shall attend you, that you may be [[#^note-78b|instructed]] more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; ^verse-78

**79**  Of things both in [[#^note-79a|heaven]] and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must [[#^note-79b|shortly]] come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the [[#^note-79c|nations]], and the judgments which are on the land; and a [[#^note-79d|knowledge]] also of countries and of kingdoms— ^verse-79

**80**  That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to [[#^note-80a|magnify]] the calling whereunto I have called you, and the [[#^note-80b|mission]] with which I have commissioned you. ^verse-80

**81**  Behold, I sent you out to [[#^note-81a|testify]] and [[#^note-81b|warn]] the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor. ^verse-81

**82**  Therefore, they are left [[#^note-82a|without]] excuse, and their sins are upon their [[#^note-82b|own heads]]. ^verse-82

**83**  He that [[#^note-83a|seeketh]] me [[#^note-83b|early]] shall find me, and shall not be forsaken. ^verse-83

**84**  Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that you may be perfected in your ministry to go forth among the [[#^note-84a|Gentiles]] for the last time, as many as the mouth of the Lord shall name, to [[#^note-84b|bind]] up the law and [[#^note-84c|seal]] up the testimony, and to prepare the saints for the hour of judgment which is to come; ^verse-84

**85**  That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the [[#^note-85a|desolation of abomination]] which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the [[#^note-85b|first]] elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall [[#^note-85c|call]] them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not [[#^note-85d|clean]] from the blood of this generation. ^verse-85

**86**  Abide ye in the [[#^note-86a|liberty]] wherewith ye are made [[#^note-86b|free]]; [[#^note-86c|entangle]] not yourselves in [[#^note-86d|sin]], but let your hands be [[#^note-86e|clean]], until the Lord comes. ^verse-86

**87**  For not many days hence and the [[#^note-87a|earth]] shall [[#^note-87b|tremble]] and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the [[#^note-87c|sun]] shall [[#^note-87d|hide]] his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in [[#^note-87e|blood]]; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall [[#^note-87f|cast]] themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig tree. ^verse-87

**88**  And after your [[#^note-88a|testimony]] cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. ^verse-88

**89**  For after your testimony cometh the testimony of [[#^note-89a|earthquakes]], that shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be able to stand. ^verse-89

**90**  And also cometh the testimony of the [[#^note-90a|voice]] of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. ^verse-90

**91**  And all things shall be in [[#^note-91a|commotion]]; and surely, men's [[#^note-91b|hearts]] shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people. ^verse-91

**92**  And [[#^note-92a|angels]] shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the [[#^note-92b|judgment]] of our God is come. Behold, and lo, the [[#^note-92c|Bridegroom]] cometh; go ye out to meet him. ^verse-92

**93**  And immediately there shall appear a [[#^note-93a|great sign]] in heaven, and all people shall see it together. ^verse-93

**94**  And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That [[#^note-94a|great]] [[#^note-94b|church]], the [[#^note-94c|mother]] of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her [[#^note-94d|fornication]], that [[#^note-94e|persecuteth]] the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the [[#^note-94f|tares]] of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it. ^verse-94

**95**  And there shall be [[#^note-95a|silence]] in [[#^note-95b|heaven]] for the space of half an hour; and immediately after shall the curtain of heaven be unfolded, as a [[#^note-95c|scroll]] is unfolded after it is rolled up, and the [[#^note-95d|face]] of the Lord shall be unveiled; ^verse-95

**96**  And the saints that are upon the earth, who are alive, shall be quickened and be [[#^note-96a|caught up]] to meet him. ^verse-96

**97**  And they who have slept in their graves shall [[#^note-97a|come]] forth, for their graves shall be opened; and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the midst of the [[#^note-97b|pillar]] of heaven— ^verse-97

**98**  They are Christ's, the [[#^note-98a|first fruits]], they who shall descend with him first, and they who are on the earth and in their graves, who are first caught up to meet him; and all this by the voice of the sounding of the trump of the angel of God. ^verse-98

**99**  And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who are Christ's at his [[#^note-99a|coming]]; who have received their part in that [[#^note-99b|prison]] which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be [[#^note-99c|judged]] according to men in the flesh. ^verse-99

**100**  And again, another trump shall sound, which is the third trump; and then come the [[#^note-100a|spirits]] of men who are to be judged, and are found under [[#^note-100b|condemnation]]; ^verse-100

**101**  And these are the rest of the [[#^note-101a|dead]]; and they live not again until the [[#^note-101b|thousand]] years are ended, neither again, until the end of the earth. ^verse-101

**102**  And another trump shall sound, which is the fourth trump, saying: There are found among those who are to [[#^note-102a|remain]] until that great and last day, even the end, who shall remain [[#^note-102b|filthy]] still. ^verse-102

**103**  And another trump shall sound, which is the fifth trump, which is the fifth angel who committeth the [[#^note-103a|everlasting gospel]]—flying through the midst of heaven, unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people; ^verse-103

**104**  And this shall be the sound of his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that are under the earth—for [[#^note-104a|every]] ear shall hear it, and every knee shall [[#^note-104b|bow]], and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the trump, saying: [[#^note-104c|Fear]] God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne, [[#^note-104d|forever]] and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come. ^verse-104

**105**  And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the sixth angel, saying: She is [[#^note-105a|fallen]] who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; she is fallen, is fallen! ^verse-105

**106**  And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it is finished! The [[#^note-106a|Lamb]] of God hath [[#^note-106b|overcome]] and [[#^note-106c|trodden]] the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. ^verse-106

**107**  And then shall the angels be crowned with the glory of his might, and the [[#^note-107a|saints]] shall be filled with his [[#^note-107b|glory]], and receive their [[#^note-107c|inheritance]] and be made [[#^note-107d|equal]] with him. ^verse-107

**108**  And then shall the first angel again sound his trump in the ears of all living, and [[#^note-108a|reveal]] the secret acts of men, and the mighty works of God in the [[#^note-108b|first thousand]] years. ^verse-108

**109**  And then shall the second angel sound his trump, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty [[#^note-109a|works]] of God in the second thousand years— ^verse-109

**110**  And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound his trump; and he shall [[#^note-110a|stand]] forth upon the land and upon the sea, and [[#^note-110b|swear]] in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne, that there shall be [[#^note-110c|time]] no longer; and [[#^note-110d|Satan]] shall be bound, that old serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space of a [[#^note-110e|thousand]] years. ^verse-110

**111**  And then he shall be [[#^note-111a|loosed]] for a little season, that he may gather together his armies. ^verse-111

**112**  And [[#^note-112a|Michael]], the seventh angel, even the archangel, shall gather together his armies, even the hosts of heaven. ^verse-112

**113**  And the devil shall gather together his [[#^note-113a|armies]]; even the hosts of hell, and shall come up to battle against Michael and his armies. ^verse-113

**114**  And then cometh the [[#^note-114a|battle]] of the great God; and the devil and his armies shall be [[#^note-114b|cast away]] into their own place, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at all. ^verse-114

**115**  For Michael shall fight their battles, and shall overcome him who [[#^note-115a|seeketh]] the throne of him who sitteth upon the throne, even the Lamb. ^verse-115

**116**  This is the glory of God, and the [[#^note-116a|sanctified]]; and they shall not any more see [[#^note-116b|death]]. ^verse-116

**117**  Therefore, verily I say unto you, my [[#^note-117a|friends]], call your solemn assembly, as I have [[#^note-117b|commanded]] you. ^verse-117

**118**  And as all have not [[#^note-118a|faith]], seek ye diligently and [[#^note-118b|teach]] one another words of [[#^note-118c|wisdom]]; yea, seek ye out of the best [[#^note-118d|books]] words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith. ^verse-118

**119**  [[#^note-119a|Organize]] yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a [[#^note-119b|house]], even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God; ^verse-119

**120**  That your [[#^note-120a|incomings]] may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with [[#^note-120b|uplifted]] hands unto the Most High. ^verse-120

**121**  Therefore, [[#^note-121a|cease]] from all your light speeches, from all [[#^note-121b|laughter]], from all your [[#^note-121c|lustful]] desires, from all your [[#^note-121d|pride]] and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings. ^verse-121

**122**  Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let [[#^note-122a|not]] all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be [[#^note-122b|edified]] of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege. ^verse-122

**123**  See that ye [[#^note-123a|love]] one another; cease to be [[#^note-123b|covetous]]; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires. ^verse-123

**124**  Cease to be [[#^note-124a|idle]]; cease to be [[#^note-124b|unclean]]; cease to [[#^note-124c|find fault]] one with another; cease to [[#^note-124d|sleep]] longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be [[#^note-124e|invigorated]]. ^verse-124

**125**  And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of [[#^note-125a|charity]], as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and [[#^note-125b|peace]]. ^verse-125

**126**  [[#^note-126a|Pray]] always, that ye may not faint, until I [[#^note-126b|come]]. Behold, and lo, I will come quickly, and receive you unto myself. Amen. ^verse-126

**127**  And again, the order of the house prepared for the [[#^note-127a|presidency]] of the [[#^note-127b|school]] of the [[#^note-127c|prophets]], established for their instruction in all things that are expedient for them, even for all the [[#^note-127d|officers]] of the church, or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in the church, beginning at the high priests, even down to the deacons— ^verse-127

**128**  And this shall be the order of the house of the presidency of the school: He that is appointed to be president, or teacher, shall be found standing in his place, in the house which shall be prepared for him. ^verse-128

**129**  Therefore, he shall be first in the house of God, in a place that the congregation in the house may hear his words carefully and distinctly, not with loud speech. ^verse-129

**130**  And when he cometh into the house of God, for he should be first in the house—behold, this is [[#^note-130a|beautiful]], that he may be an [[#^note-130b|example]]— ^verse-130

**131**  Let him offer himself in prayer upon his knees before God, in [[#^note-131a|token]] or remembrance of the everlasting covenant. ^verse-131

**132**  And when any shall come in after him, let the teacher arise, and, with [[#^note-132a|uplifted]] hands to heaven, yea, even directly, salute his brother or brethren with these words: ^verse-132

**133**  Art thou a brother or brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to [[#^note-133a|fellowship]], in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your [[#^note-133b|friend]] and [[#^note-133c|brother]] through the grace of God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever. Amen. ^verse-133

**134**  And he that is found [[#^note-134a|unworthy]] of this salutation shall not have place among you; for ye shall not suffer that mine house shall be [[#^note-134b|polluted]] by him. ^verse-134

**135**  And he that cometh in and is faithful before me, and is a brother, or if they be brethren, they shall salute the president or teacher with uplifted hands to heaven, with this same prayer and covenant, or by saying Amen, in token of the same. ^verse-135

**136**  Behold, verily, I say unto you, this is an ensample unto you for a salutation to one another in the house of God, in the school of the prophets. ^verse-136

**137**  And ye are called to do this by prayer and thanksgiving, as the Spirit shall give utterance in all your doings in the house of the Lord, in the school of the prophets, that it may become a sanctuary, a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit to your [[#^note-137a|edification]]. ^verse-137

**138**  And ye shall not receive any among you into this school save he is clean from the [[#^note-138a|blood]] of this generation; ^verse-138

**139**  And he shall be received by the ordinance of the [[#^note-139a|washing]] of feet, for unto this end was the ordinance of the washing of feet instituted. ^verse-139

**140**  And again, the ordinance of washing feet is to be administered by the president, or presiding elder of the church. ^verse-140

**141**  It is to be commenced with prayer; and after partaking of [[#^note-141a|bread and wine]], he is to gird himself according to the [[#^note-141b|pattern]] given in the thirteenth chapter of John's testimony concerning me. Amen. ^verse-141
