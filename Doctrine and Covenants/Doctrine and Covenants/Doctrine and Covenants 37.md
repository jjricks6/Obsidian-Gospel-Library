*1-4, The Saints are called to gather at the Ohio.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you that it is not expedient in me that ye should [[#^note-1a|translate]] any more until ye shall go to the Ohio, and this because of the enemy and for your sakes. ^verse-1

**2**  And again, I say unto you that ye shall not go until ye have preached my gospel in those parts, and have [[#^note-2a|strengthened]] up the church whithersoever it is found, and more especially in [[#^note-2b|Colesville]]; for, behold, they pray unto me in much faith. ^verse-2

**3**  And again, a commandment I give unto the church, that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at [[#^note-3a|the Ohio]], against the time that my servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, here is wisdom, and let every man [[#^note-4a|choose]] for himself until I come. Even so. Amen. ^verse-4
