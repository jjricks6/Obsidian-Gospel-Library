*1-2, Elders are to continue to preach; 3-6, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are to continue to translate the Bible until it is finished.*

**1**  For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that [[#^note-1a|they]] should continue preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the regions round about, until conference; ^verse-1

**2**  And then, behold, it shall be made known unto them, by the [[#^note-2a|voice]] of the conference, their several missions. ^verse-2

**3**  Now, verily I say unto you my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, saith the Lord, it is [[#^note-3a|expedient]] to [[#^note-3b|translate]] again; ^verse-3

**4**  And, inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in the regions round about until conference; and after that it is expedient to continue the work of [[#^note-4a|translation]] until it be finished. ^verse-4

**5**  And let this be a pattern unto the elders until further knowledge, even as it is written. ^verse-5

**6**  Now I give no more unto you at this time. [[#^note-6a|Gird]] up your loins and be sober. Even so. Amen. ^verse-6
