*1-3, The elders will govern the Church by the spirit of revelation; 4-6, True disciples will receive and keep the Lord's law; 7-12, Edward Partridge is named as a bishop unto the Church.*

**1**  Hearken and [[#^note-1a|hear]], O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to bless with the greatest of all [[#^note-1b|blessings]], ye that hear me; and ye that hear me not will I [[#^note-1c|curse]], that have [[#^note-1d|professed]] my [[#^note-1e|name]], with the heaviest of all cursings. ^verse-1

**2**  Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to [[#^note-2a|agree]] upon my word; ^verse-2

**3**  And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my [[#^note-3a|law]], that ye may know how to govern my [[#^note-3b|church]] and have all things right before me. ^verse-3

**4**  And I will be your [[#^note-4a|ruler]] when I [[#^note-4b|come]]; and behold, I come quickly, and ye shall see that my law is kept. ^verse-4

**5**  He that [[#^note-5a|receiveth]] my [[#^note-5b|law]] and [[#^note-5c|doeth]] it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and [[#^note-5d|doeth]] it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be [[#^note-5e|cast out]] from among you; ^verse-5

**6**  For it is not meet that the things which belong to the children of the kingdom should be given to them that are not worthy, or to [[#^note-6a|dogs]], or the [[#^note-6b|pearls]] to be cast before swine. ^verse-6

**7**  And again, it is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a [[#^note-7a|house]] built, in which to live and [[#^note-7b|translate]]. ^verse-7

**8**  And again, it is meet that my servant Sidney Rigdon should live as seemeth him good, inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments. ^verse-8

**9**  And again, I have called my servant [[#^note-9a|Edward Partridge]]; and I give a commandment, that he should be appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a [[#^note-9b|bishop]] unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to [[#^note-9c|spend]] all his time in the labors of the church; ^verse-9

**10**  To see to all things as it shall be appointed unto him in my laws in the day that I shall give them. ^verse-10

**11**  And this because his heart is pure before me, for he is like unto [[#^note-11a|Nathanael]] of old, in whom there is no [[#^note-11b|guile]]. ^verse-11

**12**  These words are given unto you, and they are pure before me; wherefore, beware how you hold them, for they are to be answered upon your [[#^note-12a|souls]] in the day of judgment. Even so. Amen. ^verse-12
