*1-3, The Lord will provide for the families of the Twelve; 4-6, Vacancies in the Twelve are filled.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord: Let a conference be held immediately; let the Twelve be organized; and let men be appointed to [[#^note-1a|supply]] the place of those who are fallen. ^verse-1

**2**  Let my servant [[#^note-2a|Thomas]] remain for a season in the land of Zion, to publish my word. ^verse-2

**3**  Let the residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this in all [[#^note-3a|lowliness]] of heart, in meekness and humility, and [[#^note-3b|long-suffering]], I, the Lord, give unto them a [[#^note-3c|promise]] that I will provide for their families; and an effectual door shall be opened for them, from henceforth. ^verse-3

**4**  And next spring let them depart to go over the great waters, and there promulgate my gospel, the fulness thereof, and bear record of my name. ^verse-4

**5**  Let them [[#^note-5a|take]] leave of my saints in the city of Far West, on the [[#^note-5b|twenty-sixth]] day of April next, on the building-spot of my house, saith the Lord. ^verse-5

**6**  Let my servant John Taylor, and also my servant John E. Page, and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be appointed to fill the places of those who have [[#^note-6a|fallen]], and be officially notified of their appointment. ^verse-6
