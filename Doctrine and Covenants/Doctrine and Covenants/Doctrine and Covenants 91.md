*1-3, The Apocrypha is mostly translated correctly but contains many interpolations by the hands of men that are not true; 4-6, It benefits those enlightened by the Spirit.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the [[#^note-1a|Apocrypha]]â€”There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly; ^verse-1

**2**  There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are [[#^note-2a|interpolations]] by the hands of men. ^verse-2

**3**  Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be [[#^note-3a|translated]]. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him [[#^note-4a|understand]], for the Spirit manifesteth truth; ^verse-4

**5**  And whoso is enlightened by the [[#^note-5a|Spirit]] shall obtain benefit therefrom; ^verse-5

**6**  And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen. ^verse-6
