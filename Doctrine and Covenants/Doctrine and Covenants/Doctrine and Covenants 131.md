*1-4, Celestial marriage is essential to exaltation in the highest heaven; 5-6, How men are sealed up unto eternal life is explained; 7-8, All spirit is matter.*

**1**    In the [[#^note-1a|celestial]] glory there are three [[#^note-1b|heavens]] or degrees; ^verse-1

**2**  And in order to obtain the [[#^note-2a|highest]], a man must enter into this [[#^note-2b|order]] of the [[#^note-2c|priesthood]] [meaning the [[#^note-2d|new and everlasting covenant]] of [[#^note-2e|marriage]]]; ^verse-2

**3**  And if he does not, he cannot obtain it. ^verse-3

**4**  He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an [[#^note-4a|increase]]. ^verse-4

**5**  (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of [[#^note-5a|prophecy]] means a man's knowing that he is [[#^note-5b|sealed]] up unto [[#^note-5c|eternal life]], by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood. ^verse-5

**6**  It is impossible for a man to be [[#^note-6a|saved]] in [[#^note-6b|ignorance]]. ^verse-6

**7**  There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All [[#^note-7a|spirit]] is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by [[#^note-7b|purer]] eyes; ^verse-7

**8**  We cannot [[#^note-8a|see]] it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all [[#^note-8b|matter]]. ^verse-8
