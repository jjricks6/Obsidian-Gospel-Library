*1-7, Joseph Smith holds the keys of the mysteries, and only he receives revelations for the Church; 8-10, Oliver Cowdery is to preach to the Lamanites; 11-16, Satan deceived Hiram Page and gave him false revelations.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto thee, [[#^note-1a|Oliver]], that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the [[#^note-1b|Comforter]], concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given. ^verse-1

**2**  But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, [[#^note-2a|no one]] shall be appointed to receive commandments and [[#^note-2b|revelations]] in this church excepting my servant [[#^note-2c|Joseph Smith, Jun.]], for he receiveth them even as [[#^note-2d|Moses]]. ^verse-2

**3**  And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even as [[#^note-3a|Aaron]], to [[#^note-3b|declare]] faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with power and [[#^note-3c|authority]] unto the church. ^verse-3

**4**  And if thou art [[#^note-4a|led]] at any time by the Comforter to [[#^note-4b|speak]] or teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it. ^verse-4

**5**  But thou shalt not write by way of [[#^note-5a|commandment]], but by wisdom; ^verse-5

**6**  And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church; ^verse-6

**7**  For I have given him the [[#^note-7a|keys]] of the [[#^note-7b|mysteries]], and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead. ^verse-7

**8**  And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the [[#^note-8a|Lamanites]] and preach my [[#^note-8b|gospel]] unto them; and inasmuch as they [[#^note-8c|receive]] thy teachings thou shalt cause my [[#^note-8d|church]] to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment. ^verse-8

**9**  And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the [[#^note-9a|city]] [[#^note-9b|Zion]] shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites. ^verse-9

**10**  Thou shalt not leave this place until after the conference; and my servant Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of it, and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell. ^verse-10

**11**  And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, [[#^note-11a|between]] him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that [[#^note-11b|stone]] are not of me and that [[#^note-11c|Satan]] [[#^note-11d|deceiveth]] him; ^verse-11

**12**  For, behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants. ^verse-12

**13**  For all things must be done in [[#^note-13a|order]], and by common [[#^note-13b|consent]] in the church, by the prayer of faith. ^verse-13

**14**  And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants of the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites. ^verse-14

**15**  And it shall be [[#^note-15a|given]] thee from the time thou shalt go, until the time thou shalt return, what thou shalt do. ^verse-15

**16**  And thou must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my gospel with the sound of rejoicing. Amen. ^verse-16
