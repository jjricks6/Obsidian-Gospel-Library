*1-6, Laborers in the vineyard will gain salvation; 7-8, Eternal life is the greatest of God's gifts; 9-11, Christ created the heavens and the earth.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|A]] great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my word. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God. ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will [[#^note-5a|knock]] it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-5

**6**  Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep my commandments in all things. ^verse-6

**7**  And, if you [[#^note-7a|keep]] my commandments and [[#^note-7b|endure]] to the end you shall have [[#^note-7c|eternal life]], which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God. ^verse-7

**8**  And it shall come to pass, that if you shall ask the Father in my name, in faith [[#^note-8a|believing]], you shall receive the [[#^note-8b|Holy Ghost]], which [[#^note-8c|giveth]] utterance, that you may stand as a [[#^note-8d|witness]] of the things of which you shall both [[#^note-8e|hear]] and see, and also that you may declare [[#^note-8f|repentance]] unto this generation. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, I am [[#^note-9a|Jesus Christ]], the [[#^note-9b|Son]] of the [[#^note-9c|living God]], who [[#^note-9d|created]] the heavens and the [[#^note-9e|earth]], a [[#^note-9f|light]] which cannot be hid in [[#^note-9g|darkness]]; ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore, I must bring forth the [[#^note-10a|fulness]] of my [[#^note-10b|gospel]] from the [[#^note-10c|Gentiles]] unto the house of Israel. ^verse-10

**11**  And behold, thou art David, and thou art called to assist; which thing if ye do, and are faithful, ye shall be blessed both spiritually and temporally, and great shall be your reward. Amen. ^verse-11
