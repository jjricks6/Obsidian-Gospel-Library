*1-3, William W. Phelps is called and chosen to be baptized, to be ordained an elder, and to preach the gospel; 4, He is also to write books for children in Church schools; 5-6, He is to travel to Missouri, which will be the area of his labors.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant William, yea, even the Lord of the whole [[#^note-1a|earth]], thou art called and chosen; and after thou hast been [[#^note-1b|baptized]] by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you shall have a remission of your sins and a reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of [[#^note-1c|hands]]; ^verse-1

**2**  And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and [[#^note-2a|remission]] of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. ^verse-2

**3**  And on whomsoever you shall [[#^note-3a|lay]] your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit. ^verse-3

**4**  And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing [[#^note-4a|books]] for [[#^note-4b|schools]] in this church, that little [[#^note-4c|children]] also may receive [[#^note-4d|instruction]] before me as is pleasing unto me. ^verse-4

**5**  And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be [[#^note-5a|planted]] in the land of your inheritance to do this work. ^verse-5

**6**  And again, let my servant [[#^note-6a|Joseph Coe]] also take his journey with them. The residue shall be made known hereafter, even as I will. Amen. ^verse-6
