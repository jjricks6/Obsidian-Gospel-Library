*1-5, All who are faithful will see the Lord; 6-18, John bore record that the Son of God went from grace to grace until He received a fulness of the glory of the Father; 19-20, Faithful men, going from grace to grace, will also receive of His fulness; 21-22, Those who are begotten through Christ are the Church of the Firstborn; 23-28, Christ received a fulness of all truth, and man by obedience may do likewise; 29-32, Man was in the beginning with God; 33-35, The elements are eternal, and man may receive a fulness of joy in the Resurrection; 36-37, The glory of God is intelligence; 38-40, Children are innocent before God because of the redemption of Christ; 41-53, The leading brethren are commanded to set their families in order.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who [[#^note-1a|forsaketh]] his [[#^note-1b|sins]] and cometh unto me, and [[#^note-1c|calleth]] on my name, and [[#^note-1d|obeyeth]] my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall [[#^note-1e|see]] my [[#^note-1f|face]] and [[#^note-1g|know]] that I am; ^verse-1

**2**  And that I am the true [[#^note-2a|light]] that lighteth every man that cometh into the world; ^verse-2

**3**  And that I am [[#^note-3a|in]] the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one— ^verse-3

**4**  The Father [[#^note-4a|because]] he [[#^note-4b|gave]] me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made [[#^note-4c|flesh]] my [[#^note-4d|tabernacle]], and dwelt among the sons of men. ^verse-4

**5**  I was in the world and received of my Father, and the [[#^note-5a|works]] of him were plainly manifest. ^verse-5

**6**  And [[#^note-6a|John]] saw and bore record of the fulness of my [[#^note-6b|glory]], and the fulness of [[#^note-6c|John's]] record is hereafter to be revealed. ^verse-6

**7**  And he bore record, saying: I saw his glory, that he was in the [[#^note-7a|beginning]], before the world was; ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore, in the beginning the [[#^note-8a|Word]] was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation— ^verse-8

**9**  The [[#^note-9a|light]] and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men. ^verse-9

**10**  The worlds were [[#^note-10a|made]] by him; men were made by him; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him. ^verse-10

**11**  And I, John, [[#^note-11a|bear record]] that I beheld his [[#^note-11b|glory]], as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us. ^verse-11

**12**  And I, John, saw that he received not of the [[#^note-12a|fulness]] at the first, but received [[#^note-12b|grace]] for grace; ^verse-12

**13**  And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from [[#^note-13a|grace]] to grace, until he received a fulness; ^verse-13

**14**  And thus he was called the [[#^note-14a|Son of God]], because he received not of the fulness at the first. ^verse-14

**15**  And I, [[#^note-15a|John]], bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my [[#^note-15b|beloved Son]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father; ^verse-16

**17**  And he received [[#^note-17a|all]] [[#^note-17b|power]], both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him. ^verse-17

**18**  And it shall come to pass, that if you are faithful you shall receive the [[#^note-18a|fulness]] of the record of John. ^verse-18

**19**  I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and [[#^note-19a|know]] how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness. ^verse-19

**20**  For if you keep my [[#^note-20a|commandments]] you shall receive of his [[#^note-20b|fulness]], and be [[#^note-20c|glorified]] in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive [[#^note-20d|grace]] for grace. ^verse-20

**21**  And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the [[#^note-21a|beginning]] with the Father, and am the [[#^note-21b|Firstborn]]; ^verse-21

**22**  And all those who are begotten through me are [[#^note-22a|partakers]] of the [[#^note-22b|glory]] of the same, and are the [[#^note-22c|church]] of the Firstborn. ^verse-22

**23**  Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is [[#^note-23a|Spirit]], even the Spirit of truth; ^verse-23

**24**  And [[#^note-24a|truth]] is [[#^note-24b|knowledge]] of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come; ^verse-24

**25**  And whatsoever is [[#^note-25a|more]] or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a [[#^note-25b|liar]] from the beginning. ^verse-25

**26**  The Spirit of [[#^note-26a|truth]] is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore record of me, saying: He [[#^note-26b|received]] a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth; ^verse-26

**27**  And no man receiveth a [[#^note-27a|fulness]] unless he keepeth his commandments. ^verse-27

**28**  He that [[#^note-28a|keepeth]] his commandments receiveth [[#^note-28b|truth]] and [[#^note-28c|light]], until he is glorified in truth and [[#^note-28d|knoweth]] all things. ^verse-28

**29**  Man was also in the [[#^note-29a|beginning]] with God. [[#^note-29b|Intelligence]], or the [[#^note-29c|light]] of [[#^note-29d|truth]], was not [[#^note-29e|created]] or made, neither indeed can be. ^verse-29

**30**  All truth is independent in that [[#^note-30a|sphere]] in which God has placed it, to [[#^note-30b|act]] for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence. ^verse-30

**31**  Behold, here is the [[#^note-31a|agency]] of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is [[#^note-31b|plainly manifest]] unto them, and they receive not the light. ^verse-31

**32**  And every man whose spirit receiveth not the [[#^note-32a|light]] is under condemnation. ^verse-32

**33**  For man is [[#^note-33a|spirit]]. The elements are [[#^note-33b|eternal]], and [[#^note-33c|spirit]] and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; ^verse-33

**34**  And when [[#^note-34a|separated]], man cannot receive a fulness of joy. ^verse-34

**35**  The [[#^note-35a|elements]] are the [[#^note-35b|tabernacle]] of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even [[#^note-35c|temples]]; and whatsoever temple is [[#^note-35d|defiled]], God shall destroy that temple. ^verse-35

**36**  The [[#^note-36a|glory]] of God is [[#^note-36b|intelligence]], or, in other words, [[#^note-36c|light]] and truth. ^verse-36

**37**  Light and truth forsake that [[#^note-37a|evil one]]. ^verse-37

**38**  Every [[#^note-38a|spirit]] of man was [[#^note-38b|innocent]] in the beginning; and God having [[#^note-38c|redeemed]] man from the [[#^note-38d|fall]], men became again, in their infant state, [[#^note-38e|innocent]] before God. ^verse-38

**39**  And that [[#^note-39a|wicked one]] cometh and [[#^note-39b|taketh]] away light and truth, through [[#^note-39c|disobedience]], from the children of men, and because of the [[#^note-39d|tradition]] of their fathers. ^verse-39

**40**  But I have commanded you to bring up your [[#^note-40a|children]] in [[#^note-40b|light]] and truth. ^verse-40

**41**  But verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have continued under this condemnation; ^verse-41

**42**  You have not [[#^note-42a|taught]] your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your [[#^note-42b|affliction]]. ^verse-42

**43**  And now a commandment I give unto you—if you will be delivered you shall set in [[#^note-43a|order]] your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your house. ^verse-43

**44**  Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he hath not kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order thy house. ^verse-44

**45**  Verily, I say unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., or in other words, I will call you [[#^note-45a|friends]], for you are my friends, and ye shall have an inheritance with me— ^verse-45

**46**  I called you [[#^note-46a|servants]] for the world's sake, and ye are their servants for my sake— ^verse-46

**47**  And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun.—You have not kept the commandments, and must needs stand [[#^note-47a|rebuked]] before the Lord; ^verse-47

**48**  Your [[#^note-48a|family]] must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place. ^verse-48

**49**  What I say unto one I say unto all; [[#^note-49a|pray]] always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place. ^verse-49

**50**  My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be [[#^note-50a|chastened]], and set in [[#^note-50b|order]] his family, and see that they are more [[#^note-50c|diligent]] and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their [[#^note-50d|place]]. ^verse-50

**51**  Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the [[#^note-51a|acceptable]] year of the Lord, and the [[#^note-51b|gospel]] of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him. ^verse-51

**52**  And let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. Williams make haste also, and it shall be given them even according to the prayer of faith; and inasmuch as you keep my sayings you shall not be confounded in this world, nor in the world to come. ^verse-52

**53**  And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should [[#^note-53a|hasten]] to [[#^note-53b|translate my scriptures]], and to [[#^note-53c|obtain]] a [[#^note-53d|knowledge]] of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of [[#^note-53e|laws]] of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion. Amen. ^verse-53
