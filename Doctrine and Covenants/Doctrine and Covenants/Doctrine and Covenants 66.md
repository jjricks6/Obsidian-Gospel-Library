*1-4, The everlasting covenant is the fulness of the gospel; 5-8, Elders are to preach, testify, and reason with the people; 9-13, Faithful ministerial service ensures an inheritance of eternal life.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant [[#^note-1a|William E. McLellin]]—Blessed are you, inasmuch as you have [[#^note-1b|turned away]] from your iniquities, and have received my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the [[#^note-1c|Savior]] of the world, even of as many as believe on my name. ^verse-1

**2**  Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine [[#^note-2a|everlasting covenant]], even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have [[#^note-2b|life]] and be made [[#^note-2c|partakers]] of the [[#^note-2d|glories]] which are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and apostles in days of old. ^verse-2

**3**  Verily I say unto you, my servant William, that you are clean, but not [[#^note-3a|all]]; repent, therefore, of those things which are not pleasing in my sight, saith the Lord, for the Lord will [[#^note-3b|show]] them unto you. ^verse-3

**4**  And now, verily, I, the Lord, [[#^note-4a|will]] show unto you what I will concerning you, or what is my will concerning you. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should [[#^note-5a|proclaim]] my gospel from land to land, and from [[#^note-5b|city to city]], yea, in those regions round about where it has not been proclaimed. ^verse-5

**6**  Tarry [[#^note-6a|not]] many days in this place; go not up unto the land of Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you can [[#^note-6b|send]], send; otherwise, think not of thy property. ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Go]] unto the eastern lands, bear [[#^note-7b|testimony]] in every place, unto every people and in their [[#^note-7c|synagogues]], reasoning with the people. ^verse-7

**8**  Let my servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and forsake him not, and give him thine instructions; and he that is [[#^note-8a|faithful]] shall be made [[#^note-8b|strong]] in every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you. ^verse-8

**9**  Lay your [[#^note-9a|hands]] upon the [[#^note-9b|sick]], and they shall [[#^note-9c|recover]]. Return not till I, the Lord, shall send you. Be patient in affliction. [[#^note-9d|Ask]], and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-9

**10**  Seek not to be [[#^note-10a|cumbered]]. Forsake all [[#^note-10b|unrighteousness]]. Commit not [[#^note-10c|adultery]]—a temptation with which thou hast been troubled. ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Keep]] these sayings, for they are true and [[#^note-11b|faithful]]; and thou shalt [[#^note-11c|magnify]] thine office, and push many people to [[#^note-11d|Zion]] with [[#^note-11e|songs]] of everlasting joy upon their heads. ^verse-11

**12**  [[#^note-12a|Continue]] in these things even unto the end, and you shall have a [[#^note-12b|crown]] of eternal life at the right hand of my Father, who is full of [[#^note-12c|grace]] and truth. ^verse-12

**13**  Verily, thus saith the Lord your [[#^note-13a|God]], your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen. ^verse-13
