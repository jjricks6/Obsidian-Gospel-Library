**1**  A [[#^note-1a|revelation]] of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they [[#^note-1b|united]] their hearts and [[#^note-1c|lifted]] their voices on high. ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the [[#^note-2a|restoration]] of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his [[#^note-2b|prophets]], and for the [[#^note-2c|gathering]] of his [[#^note-2d|saints]] to stand upon [[#^note-2e|Mount Zion]], which shall be the city of [[#^note-2f|New Jerusalem]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Which city shall be [[#^note-3a|built]], beginning at the [[#^note-3b|temple]] lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and [[#^note-3c|dedicated]] by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased. ^verse-3

**4**  Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city [[#^note-4a|New Jerusalem]] shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the [[#^note-4b|temple]], which temple shall be [[#^note-4c|reared]] in this [[#^note-4d|generation]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For verily this generation shall not all [[#^note-5a|pass away]] until an [[#^note-5b|house]] shall be built unto the Lord, and a [[#^note-5c|cloud]] shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the [[#^note-5d|glory]] of the Lord, which shall fill the house. ^verse-5

**6**  [[#^note-6a|And]] the [[#^note-6b|sons of Moses]], according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the [[#^note-6c|hand]] of his father-in-law, [[#^note-6d|Jethro]]; ^verse-6

**7**  And Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb; ^verse-7

**8**  And Caleb received it under the hand of Elihu; ^verse-8

**9**  And Elihu under the hand of Jeremy; ^verse-9

**10**  And Jeremy under the hand of Gad; ^verse-10

**11**  And Gad under the hand of Esaias; ^verse-11

**12**  And Esaias received it under the hand of God. ^verse-12

**13**  [[#^note-13a|Esaias]] also lived in the days of Abraham, and was blessed of him— ^verse-13

**14**  Which [[#^note-14a|Abraham]] received the priesthood from [[#^note-14b|Melchizedek]], who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till [[#^note-14c|Noah]]; ^verse-14

**15**  And from Noah till [[#^note-15a|Enoch]], through the lineage of their fathers; ^verse-15

**16**  And from Enoch to [[#^note-16a|Abel]], who was slain by the [[#^note-16b|conspiracy]] of his brother, who [[#^note-16c|received]] the priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his father [[#^note-16d|Adam]], who was the first man— ^verse-16

**17**  Which [[#^note-17a|priesthood]] [[#^note-17b|continueth]] in the church of God in all generations, and is without [[#^note-17c|beginning]] of days or end of years. ^verse-17

**18**  And the Lord confirmed a [[#^note-18a|priesthood]] also upon [[#^note-18b|Aaron]] and his [[#^note-18c|seed]], throughout all their generations, which priesthood also continueth and [[#^note-18d|abideth]] forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God. ^verse-18

**19**  And this greater [[#^note-19a|priesthood]] administereth the gospel and holdeth the [[#^note-19b|key]] of the [[#^note-19c|mysteries]] of the kingdom, even the key of the [[#^note-19d|knowledge]] of God. ^verse-19

**20**  Therefore, in the [[#^note-20a|ordinances]] thereof, the power of [[#^note-20b|godliness]] is manifest. ^verse-20

**21**  And without the ordinances thereof, and the [[#^note-21a|authority]] of the priesthood, the power of godliness is [[#^note-21b|not]] manifest unto men in the flesh; ^verse-21

**22**  For without this no [[#^note-22a|man]] can see the face of God, even the Father, and live. ^verse-22

**23**  Now this [[#^note-23a|Moses]] plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to [[#^note-23b|sanctify]] his people that they might [[#^note-23c|behold]] the face of God; ^verse-23

**24**  But they [[#^note-24a|hardened]] their hearts and could not endure his [[#^note-24b|presence]]; therefore, the Lord in his [[#^note-24c|wrath]], for his [[#^note-24d|anger]] was kindled against them, swore that they should not [[#^note-24e|enter]] into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory. ^verse-24

**25**  Therefore, he took [[#^note-25a|Moses]] out of their midst, and the Holy [[#^note-25b|Priesthood]] also; ^verse-25

**26**  And the lesser [[#^note-26a|priesthood]] continued, which priesthood holdeth the [[#^note-26b|key]] of the [[#^note-26c|ministering]] of angels and the [[#^note-26d|preparatory gospel]]; ^verse-26

**27**  Which [[#^note-27a|gospel]] is the gospel of [[#^note-27b|repentance]] and of [[#^note-27c|baptism]], and the [[#^note-27d|remission]] of sins, and the [[#^note-27e|law]] of [[#^note-27f|carnal]] commandments, which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until [[#^note-27g|John]], whom God raised up, being [[#^note-27h|filled]] with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb. ^verse-27

**28**  For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was [[#^note-28a|ordained]] by the angel of God at the time he was [[#^note-28b|eight]] days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to [[#^note-28c|make]] straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to prepare them for the [[#^note-28d|coming]] of the Lord, in whose hand is given [[#^note-28e|all power]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And again, the [[#^note-29a|offices]] of elder and bishop are necessary [[#^note-29b|appendages]] belonging unto the high priesthood. ^verse-29

**30**  And again, the offices of [[#^note-30a|teacher]] and deacon are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser priesthood, which priesthood was confirmed upon [[#^note-30b|Aaron]] and his sons. ^verse-30

**31**  Therefore, as I said [[#^note-31a|concerning]] the sons of Moses—for the sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable [[#^note-31b|offering]] and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated [[#^note-31c|spot]] as I have appointed— ^verse-31

**32**  And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the [[#^note-32a|glory]] of the Lord, upon [[#^note-32b|Mount Zion]] in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my [[#^note-32c|church]]. ^verse-32

**33**  For whoso is [[#^note-33a|faithful]] unto the obtaining these two [[#^note-33b|priesthoods]] of which I have spoken, and the [[#^note-33c|magnifying]] their calling, are [[#^note-33d|sanctified]] by the Spirit unto the [[#^note-33e|renewing]] of their bodies. ^verse-33

**34**  They become the [[#^note-34a|sons of Moses]] and of Aaron and the [[#^note-34b|seed]] of [[#^note-34c|Abraham]], and the church and kingdom, and the [[#^note-34d|elect]] of God. ^verse-34

**35**  And also all they who [[#^note-35a|receive]] this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord; ^verse-35

**36**  For he that [[#^note-36a|receiveth]] my servants receiveth me; ^verse-36

**37**  And he that [[#^note-37a|receiveth]] me receiveth my Father; ^verse-37

**38**  And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's [[#^note-38a|kingdom]]; therefore [[#^note-38b|all]] that my Father hath shall be given unto him. ^verse-38

**39**  And this is according to the [[#^note-39a|oath and covenant]] which belongeth to the priesthood. ^verse-39

**40**  Therefore, all those who receive the [[#^note-40a|priesthood]], receive this [[#^note-40b|oath and covenant]] of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved. ^verse-40

**41**  But whoso breaketh this [[#^note-41a|covenant]] after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall [[#^note-41b|not]] have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come. ^verse-41

**42**  And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels [[#^note-42a|charge]] concerning you. ^verse-42

**43**  And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give [[#^note-43a|diligent]] [[#^note-43b|heed]] to the words of eternal life. ^verse-43

**44**  For you shall [[#^note-44a|live]] by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. ^verse-44

**45**  For the [[#^note-45a|word]] of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is [[#^note-45b|light]], and whatsoever is light is [[#^note-45c|Spirit]], even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. ^verse-45

**46**  And the [[#^note-46a|Spirit]] giveth [[#^note-46b|light]] to [[#^note-46c|every man]] that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit. ^verse-46

**47**  And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit [[#^note-47a|cometh]] unto God, even the Father. ^verse-47

**48**  And the Father [[#^note-48a|teacheth]] him of the covenant which he has [[#^note-48b|renewed]] and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the [[#^note-48c|whole world]]. ^verse-48

**49**  And the whole [[#^note-49a|world]] lieth in sin, and groaneth under [[#^note-49b|darkness]] and under the [[#^note-49c|bondage]] of sin. ^verse-49

**50**  And by this you may know they are under the [[#^note-50a|bondage]] of sin, because they come not unto me. ^verse-50

**51**  For whoso cometh not unto me is under the [[#^note-51a|bondage]] of sin. ^verse-51

**52**  And whoso receiveth not [[#^note-52a|my voice]] is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me. ^verse-52

**53**  And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and that the whole [[#^note-53a|world]] [[#^note-53b|groaneth]] under sin and darkness even now. ^verse-53

**54**  And your [[#^note-54a|minds]] in times past have been [[#^note-54b|darkened]] because of [[#^note-54c|unbelief]], and because you have treated [[#^note-54d|lightly]] the things you have received— ^verse-54

**55**  Which [[#^note-55a|vanity]] and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation. ^verse-55

**56**  And this condemnation resteth upon the children of [[#^note-56a|Zion]], even all. ^verse-56

**57**  And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new [[#^note-57a|covenant]], even the [[#^note-57b|Book of Mormon]] and the [[#^note-57c|former]] commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to [[#^note-57d|do]] according to that which I have written— ^verse-57

**58**  That they may bring forth [[#^note-58a|fruit]] meet for their Father's kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a [[#^note-58b|scourge]] and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion. ^verse-58

**59**  For shall the children of the kingdom [[#^note-59a|pollute]] my holy land? Verily, I say unto you, Nay. ^verse-59

**60**  Verily, verily, I say unto you who now hear my [[#^note-60a|words]], which are my voice, blessed are ye inasmuch as you receive these things; ^verse-60

**61**  For I will [[#^note-61a|forgive]] you of your sins with this commandment—that you remain [[#^note-61b|steadfast]] in your minds in [[#^note-61c|solemnity]] and the spirit of prayer, in bearing [[#^note-61d|testimony]] to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you. ^verse-61

**62**  Therefore, [[#^note-62a|go]] ye into all the world; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send, that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature. ^verse-62

**63**  And as I said unto mine [[#^note-63a|apostles]], even so I say unto you, for you are mine apostles, even God's high priests; ye are they whom my Father hath [[#^note-63b|given]] me; ye are my [[#^note-63c|friends]]; ^verse-63

**64**  Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every [[#^note-64a|soul]] who [[#^note-64b|believeth]] on your words, and is baptized by water for the [[#^note-64c|remission]] of sins, shall [[#^note-64d|receive]] the Holy Ghost. ^verse-64

**65**  And these [[#^note-65a|signs]] shall follow them that believe— ^verse-65

**66**  In my name they shall do many wonderful [[#^note-66a|works]]; ^verse-66

**67**  In my [[#^note-67a|name]] they shall cast out devils; ^verse-67

**68**  In my name they shall [[#^note-68a|heal]] the sick; ^verse-68

**69**  In my name they shall [[#^note-69a|open]] the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf; ^verse-69

**70**  And the tongue of the dumb shall speak; ^verse-70

**71**  And if any man shall administer [[#^note-71a|poison]] unto them it shall not hurt them; ^verse-71

**72**  And the [[#^note-72a|poison]] of a serpent shall not have power to harm them. ^verse-72

**73**  But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not [[#^note-73a|boast]] themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation. ^verse-73

**74**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are not [[#^note-74a|baptized]] in water in my name, for the [[#^note-74b|remission]] of their sins, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be [[#^note-74c|damned]], and shall not come into my Father's kingdom where my Father and I am. ^verse-74

**75**  And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the [[#^note-75a|world]], and the gospel is unto all who have not received it. ^verse-75

**76**  But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given—from you it [[#^note-76a|must]] be [[#^note-76b|preached]] unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil [[#^note-76c|hearts]] of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their [[#^note-76d|rebellion]] against you at the time I sent you. ^verse-76

**77**  And again I say unto you, my [[#^note-77a|friends]], for from henceforth I shall call you friends, it is expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power; ^verse-77

**78**  For I suffered them not to have [[#^note-78a|purse]] or scrip, neither two coats. ^verse-78

**79**  Behold, I [[#^note-79a|send]] you out to [[#^note-79b|prove]] the world, and the laborer is worthy of his [[#^note-79c|hire]]. ^verse-79

**80**  And any man that shall go and preach this [[#^note-80a|gospel]] of the kingdom, and fail not to continue [[#^note-80b|faithful]] in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a [[#^note-80c|hair]] of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst. ^verse-80

**81**  Therefore, take ye no [[#^note-81a|thought]] for the morrow, for what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. ^verse-81

**82**  For, [[#^note-82a|consider]] the [[#^note-82b|lilies]] of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin; and the kingdoms of the world, in all their glory, are not arrayed like one of these. ^verse-82

**83**  For your [[#^note-83a|Father]], who is in heaven, [[#^note-83b|knoweth]] that you have need of all these things. ^verse-83

**84**  Therefore, let the morrow take [[#^note-84a|thought]] for the things of itself. ^verse-84

**85**  Neither take ye thought beforehand [[#^note-85a|what]] ye shall say; but [[#^note-85b|treasure]] up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be [[#^note-85c|given]] you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man. ^verse-85

**86**  Therefore, let no man among you, for this commandment is unto all the [[#^note-86a|faithful]] who are called of God in the church unto the ministry, from this hour take purse or scrip, that goeth forth to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom. ^verse-86

**87**  Behold, I send you out to [[#^note-87a|reprove]] the world of all their unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. ^verse-87

**88**  And whoso [[#^note-88a|receiveth]] you, there I will be also, for I will go [[#^note-88b|before]] your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my [[#^note-88c|Spirit]] shall be in your hearts, and mine [[#^note-88d|angels]] round about you, to bear you up. ^verse-88

**89**  Whoso receiveth you receiveth me; and the same will feed you, and clothe you, and give you money. ^verse-89

**90**  And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise [[#^note-90a|lose]] his reward. ^verse-90

**91**  And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple; by this you may know [[#^note-91a|my disciples]]. ^verse-91

**92**  He that receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves, and [[#^note-92a|cleanse]] your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven, and return not again unto that man. ^verse-92

**93**  And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise. ^verse-93

**94**  Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not; and wo unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony concerning me. ^verse-94

**95**  Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony of me; ^verse-95

**96**  For I, the [[#^note-96a|Almighty]], have laid my hands upon the nations, to [[#^note-96b|scourge]] them for their [[#^note-96c|wickedness]]. ^verse-96

**97**  And [[#^note-97a|plagues]] shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut [[#^note-97b|short]] in righteousness— ^verse-97

**98**  Until all shall [[#^note-98a|know]] me, who remain, even from the least unto the greatest, and shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall [[#^note-98b|see]] eye to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and with the voice together [[#^note-98c|sing]] this new song, saying: ^verse-98

**99**  The Lord hath brought again Zion;The Lord hath [[#^note-99a|redeemed]] his people, [[#^note-99b|Israel]],According to the [[#^note-99c|election]] of [[#^note-99d|grace]],Which was brought to pass by the faithAnd [[#^note-99e|covenant]] of their fathers. ^verse-99

**100**  The Lord hath redeemed his people;And Satan is [[#^note-100a|bound]] and [[#^note-100b|time]] is no longer.The Lord hath gathered all things in [[#^note-100c|one]].The Lord hath brought down [[#^note-100d|Zion]] from above.The Lord hath [[#^note-100e|brought up]] Zion from beneath. ^verse-100

**101**  The [[#^note-101a|earth]] hath travailed and [[#^note-101b|brought forth]] her strength;And truth is established in her bowels;And the heavens have smiled upon her;And she is clothed with the [[#^note-101c|glory]] of her God;For he [[#^note-101d|stands]] in the midst of his [[#^note-101e|people]]. ^verse-101

**102**  Glory, and honor, and power, and might,Be ascribed to our God; for he is full of [[#^note-102a|mercy]],Justice, grace and truth, and [[#^note-102b|peace]],Forever and ever, Amen. ^verse-102

**103**  And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, it is expedient that every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that inasmuch as they have [[#^note-103a|families]], and receive [[#^note-103b|money]] by gift, that they should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit, as the Lord shall direct them, for thus it seemeth me good. ^verse-103

**104**  And let all those who have not families, who receive [[#^note-104a|money]], send it up unto the bishop in Zion, or unto the bishop in Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion. ^verse-104

**105**  And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a suit, take the old and cast it unto the [[#^note-105a|poor]], and go on your way rejoicing. ^verse-105

**106**  And if any man among you be [[#^note-106a|strong]] in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is [[#^note-106b|weak]], that he may be [[#^note-106c|edified]] in all [[#^note-106d|meekness]], that he may become strong also. ^verse-106

**107**  Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the [[#^note-107a|lesser priesthood]], and send them [[#^note-107b|before]] you to make appointments, and to prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill. ^verse-107

**108**  Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me. ^verse-108

**109**  Therefore, let every man stand in his own [[#^note-109a|office]], and [[#^note-109b|labor]] in his own calling; and let not the [[#^note-109c|head]] say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand? ^verse-109

**110**  Also the body hath need of every [[#^note-110a|member]], that all may be [[#^note-110b|edified]] together, that the system may be kept perfect. ^verse-110

**111**  And behold, the [[#^note-111a|high priests]] should travel, and also the elders, and also the lesser [[#^note-111b|priests]]; but the [[#^note-111c|deacons]] and [[#^note-111d|teachers]] should be appointed to [[#^note-111e|watch]] over the church, to be standing ministers unto the church. ^verse-111

**112**  And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also should travel round about and among all the churches, searching after the poor to [[#^note-112a|administer]] to their wants by [[#^note-112b|humbling]] the rich and the proud. ^verse-112

**113**  He should also employ an [[#^note-113a|agent]] to take charge and to do his secular business as he shall direct. ^verse-113

**114**  Nevertheless, let the bishop go unto the city of New York, also to the city of Albany, and also to the city of Boston, and warn the people of those [[#^note-114a|cities]] with the sound of the gospel, with a loud voice, of the [[#^note-114b|desolation]] and utter abolishment which await them if they do reject these things. ^verse-114

**115**  For if they do reject these things the hour of their judgment is nigh, and their house shall be left unto them [[#^note-115a|desolate]]. ^verse-115

**116**  Let him [[#^note-116a|trust]] in me and he shall not be [[#^note-116b|confounded]]; and a [[#^note-116c|hair]] of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. ^verse-116

**117**  And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, go ye forth as your circumstances shall permit, in your several callings, unto the great and notable cities and villages, [[#^note-117a|reproving]] the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of [[#^note-117b|abomination]] in the last days. ^verse-117

**118**  For, with you saith the Lord [[#^note-118a|Almighty]], I will [[#^note-118b|rend]] their [[#^note-118c|kingdoms]]; I will not only [[#^note-118d|shake]] the earth, but the [[#^note-118e|starry]] heavens shall tremble. ^verse-118

**119**  For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the [[#^note-119a|powers]] of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a [[#^note-119b|little while]] and ye shall see it, and know that [[#^note-119c|I]] am, and that I will [[#^note-119d|come]] and reign with my people. ^verse-119

**120**  I am [[#^note-120a|Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end. Amen. ^verse-120
