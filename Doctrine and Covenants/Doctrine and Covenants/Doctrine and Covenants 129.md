*1-3, There are both resurrected and spirit bodies in heaven; 4-9, Keys are given whereby messengers from beyond the veil may be identified.*

**1**  There are two kinds of beings in [[#^note-1a|heaven]], namely: [[#^note-1b|Angels]], who are [[#^note-1c|resurrected]] personages, having [[#^note-1d|bodies]] of flesh and bones— ^verse-1

**2**  For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not [[#^note-2a|flesh]] and bones, as ye see me have. ^verse-2

**3**  Secondly: the [[#^note-3a|spirits]] of [[#^note-3b|just]] men made [[#^note-3c|perfect]], they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory. ^verse-3

**4**  When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you. ^verse-4

**5**  If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand. ^verse-5

**6**  If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear— ^verse-6

**7**  Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the [[#^note-7a|order]] of heaven for a just man to [[#^note-7b|deceive]]; but he will still deliver his message. ^verse-7

**8**  If it be the [[#^note-8a|devil]] as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not [[#^note-8b|feel]] anything; you may therefore detect him. ^verse-8

**9**  These are three grand [[#^note-9a|keys]] whereby you may know whether any administration is from God. ^verse-9
