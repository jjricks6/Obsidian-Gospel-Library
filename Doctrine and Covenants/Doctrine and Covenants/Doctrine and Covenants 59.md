*1-4, The faithful Saints in Zion will be blessed; 5-8, They are to love and serve the Lord and keep His commandments; 9-19, By keeping the Lord's day holy, the Saints are blessed temporally and spiritually; 20-24, The righteous are promised peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come.*

**1**  Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with an [[#^note-1a|eye]] single to my glory, according to my commandments. ^verse-1

**2**  For those that live shall [[#^note-2a|inherit]] the earth, and those that [[#^note-2b|die]] shall rest from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall receive a [[#^note-2c|crown]] in the [[#^note-2d|mansions]] of my Father, which I have prepared for them. ^verse-2

**3**  Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its [[#^note-3a|strength]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with [[#^note-4a|commandments]] not a few, and with [[#^note-4b|revelations]] in their time—they that are [[#^note-4c|faithful]] and [[#^note-4d|diligent]] before me. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt [[#^note-5a|love]] the Lord thy God with all thy [[#^note-5b|heart]], with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt [[#^note-5c|serve]] him. ^verse-5

**6**  Thou shalt [[#^note-6a|love]] thy [[#^note-6b|neighbor]] as thyself. Thou shalt not [[#^note-6c|steal]]; neither commit [[#^note-6d|adultery]], nor [[#^note-6e|kill]], nor do anything [[#^note-6f|like]] unto it. ^verse-6

**7**  Thou shalt [[#^note-7a|thank]] the Lord thy God in all things. ^verse-7

**8**  Thou shalt offer a [[#^note-8a|sacrifice]] unto the Lord thy God in [[#^note-8b|righteousness]], even that of a broken heart and a [[#^note-8c|contrite spirit]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself [[#^note-9a|unspotted]] from the world, thou shalt go to the house of [[#^note-9b|prayer]] and offer up thy [[#^note-9c|sacraments]] upon my [[#^note-9d|holy day]]; ^verse-9

**10**  For verily this is a [[#^note-10a|day]] appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High; ^verse-10

**11**  Nevertheless thy [[#^note-11a|vows]] shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times; ^verse-11

**12**  But remember that on this, the [[#^note-12a|Lord's day]], thou shalt offer thine [[#^note-12b|oblations]] and thy sacraments unto the Most High, [[#^note-12c|confessing]] thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord. ^verse-12

**13**  And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy [[#^note-13a|fasting]] may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy [[#^note-13b|joy]] may be full. ^verse-13

**14**  Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer. ^verse-14

**15**  And inasmuch as ye do these things with [[#^note-15a|thanksgiving]], with [[#^note-15b|cheerful]] [[#^note-15c|hearts]] and countenances, not with [[#^note-15d|much]] [[#^note-15e|laughter]], for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance— ^verse-15

**16**  Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the [[#^note-16a|fulness]] of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth; ^verse-16

**17**  Yea, and the herb, and the [[#^note-17a|good]] things which come of the earth, whether for food or for [[#^note-17b|raiment]], or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards; ^verse-17

**18**  Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the [[#^note-18a|benefit]] and the [[#^note-18b|use]] of man, both to please the eye and to [[#^note-18c|gladden]] the heart; ^verse-18

**19**  Yea, for [[#^note-19a|food]] and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to [[#^note-19b|strengthen]] the body and to enliven the soul. ^verse-19

**20**  And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to [[#^note-20a|excess]], neither by extortion. ^verse-20

**21**  And in nothing doth man [[#^note-21a|offend]] God, or against none is his [[#^note-21b|wrath]] [[#^note-21c|kindled]], save those who [[#^note-21d|confess not]] his hand in all things, and [[#^note-21e|obey not]] his commandments. ^verse-21

**22**  Behold, this is according to the law and the prophets; wherefore, trouble me no more concerning this matter. ^verse-22

**23**  But learn that he who doeth the works of [[#^note-23a|righteousness]] shall receive his [[#^note-23b|reward]], even [[#^note-23c|peace]] in this world, and [[#^note-23d|eternal life]] in the world to come. ^verse-23

**24**  I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen. ^verse-24
