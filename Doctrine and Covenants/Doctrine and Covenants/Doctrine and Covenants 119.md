*1-5, The Saints are to pay their surplus property and then give, as tithing, one-tenth of their interest annually; 6-7, Such a course will sanctify the land of Zion.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their [[#^note-1a|surplus]] property to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion, ^verse-1

**2**  For the building of mine [[#^note-2a|house]], and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church. ^verse-2

**3**  And this shall be the beginning of the [[#^note-3a|tithing]] of my people. ^verse-3

**4**  And after that, those who have thus been [[#^note-4a|tithed]] shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of [[#^note-5a|Zion]] shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you. ^verse-5

**6**  And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of [[#^note-6a|Zion]] unto me, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you. ^verse-6

**7**  And this shall be an ensample unto all the [[#^note-7a|stakes]] of Zion. Even so. Amen. ^verse-7
