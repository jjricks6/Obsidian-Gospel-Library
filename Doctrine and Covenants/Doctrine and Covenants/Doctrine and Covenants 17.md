*1-4, By faith the Three Witnesses will see the plates and other sacred items; 5-9, Christ bears testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which if you do with full purpose of heart, you shall have a [[#^note-1a|view]] of the [[#^note-1b|plates]], and also of the [[#^note-1c|breastplate]], the [[#^note-1d|sword]] of Laban, the [[#^note-1e|Urim and Thummim]], which were given to the [[#^note-1f|brother of Jared]] upon the mount, when he talked with the Lord [[#^note-1g|face to face]], and the [[#^note-1h|miraculous]] directors which were given to Lehi while in the wilderness, on the borders of the [[#^note-1i|Red Sea]]. ^verse-1

**2**  And it is by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them, even by that faith which was had by the prophets of old. ^verse-2

**3**  And after that you have obtained faith, and have seen them with your eyes, you shall [[#^note-3a|testify]] of them, by the power of God; ^verse-3

**4**  And this you shall do that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may not be destroyed, that I may bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men in this work. ^verse-4

**5**  And ye shall testify that you have seen them, even as my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., has seen them; for it is by my power that he has seen them, and it is because he had faith. ^verse-5

**6**  And he has translated the [[#^note-6a|book]], even that [[#^note-6b|part]] which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, you have received the same power, and the same faith, and the same gift like unto him; ^verse-7

**8**  And if you do these last [[#^note-8a|commandments]] of mine, which I have given you, the [[#^note-8b|gates]] of hell shall not prevail against you; for my [[#^note-8c|grace]] is sufficient for you, and you shall be [[#^note-8d|lifted up]] at the last day. ^verse-8

**9**  And I, Jesus Christ, your [[#^note-9a|Lord]] and your God, have spoken it unto you, that I might bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men. Amen. ^verse-9
