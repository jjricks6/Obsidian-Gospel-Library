*1-2, Many of the Saints in Zion (Jackson County, Missouri) are blessed for their faithfulness; 3-5, Parley P. Pratt is commended for his labors in the school in Zion; 6-9, Those who observe their covenants are accepted by the Lord; 10-17, A house is to be built in Zion in which the pure in heart will see God; 18-21, Zion is the pure in heart; 22-28, Zion will escape the Lord's scourge if she is faithful.*

**1**  Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my [[#^note-1a|voice]], even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of [[#^note-1b|Zion]], many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth. ^verse-1

**2**  Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the [[#^note-2a|meek]], and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be [[#^note-2b|justified]] when I shall bring them unto judgment. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, I say unto you, concerning the [[#^note-3a|school]] in Zion, I, the Lord, am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant [[#^note-3b|Parley P. Pratt]], for he abideth in me. ^verse-3

**4**  And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside over the school in the land of Zion until I shall give unto him other commandments. ^verse-4

**5**  And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the [[#^note-5a|school]], and of the church in Zion. ^verse-5

**6**  And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy; nevertheless, there are those that must needs be [[#^note-6a|chastened]], and their works shall be made known. ^verse-6

**7**  The [[#^note-7a|ax]] is laid at the root of the trees; and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. I, the Lord, have spoken it. ^verse-7

**8**  Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are [[#^note-8a|honest]], and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are [[#^note-8b|willing]] to observe their covenants by [[#^note-8c|sacrifice]]—yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command—they are [[#^note-8d|accepted]] of me. ^verse-8

**9**  For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful [[#^note-9a|tree]] which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit. ^verse-9

**10**  Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that a [[#^note-10a|house]] should be built unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the [[#^note-10b|pattern]] which I have given you. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, let it be built speedily, by the tithing of my people. ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, this is the [[#^note-12a|tithing]] and the [[#^note-12b|sacrifice]] which I, the Lord, require at their hands, that there may be a [[#^note-12c|house]] built unto me for the salvation of Zion— ^verse-12

**13**  For a place of [[#^note-13a|thanksgiving]] for all saints, and for a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and offices; ^verse-13

**14**  That they may be perfected in the [[#^note-14a|understanding]] of their ministry, in theory, in principle, and in doctrine, in all things pertaining to the [[#^note-14b|kingdom]] of God on the earth, the [[#^note-14c|keys]] of which kingdom have been [[#^note-14d|conferred]] upon you. ^verse-14

**15**  And inasmuch as my people [[#^note-15a|build]] a [[#^note-15b|house]] unto me in the [[#^note-15c|name]] of the Lord, and do not suffer any [[#^note-15d|unclean thing]] to come into it, that it be not defiled, my [[#^note-15e|glory]] shall rest upon it; ^verse-15

**16**  Yea, and my [[#^note-16a|presence]] shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the [[#^note-16b|pure]] in heart that shall come into it shall see God. ^verse-16

**17**  But if it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be there; for I will not come into [[#^note-17a|unholy]] temples. ^verse-17

**18**  And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she shall [[#^note-18a|prosper]], and spread herself and become very glorious, very great, and very terrible. ^verse-18

**19**  And the [[#^note-19a|nations]] of the earth shall honor her, and shall say: Surely [[#^note-19b|Zion]] is the city of our God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there; ^verse-19

**20**  And he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her salvation and her high [[#^note-20a|tower]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let [[#^note-21a|Zion]] rejoice, for this is Zion—the pure in heart; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn. ^verse-21

**22**  For behold, and lo, [[#^note-22a|vengeance]] cometh speedily upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall escape it? ^verse-22

**23**  The Lord's [[#^note-23a|scourge]] shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof shall vex all people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come; ^verse-23

**24**  For the [[#^note-24a|indignation]] of the Lord is kindled against their abominations and all their wicked works. ^verse-24

**25**  Nevertheless, Zion shall [[#^note-25a|escape]] if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her. ^verse-25

**26**  But if she [[#^note-26a|observe]] not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will [[#^note-26b|visit]] her [[#^note-26c|according]] to all her works, with sore affliction, with [[#^note-26d|pestilence]], with [[#^note-26e|plague]], with sword, with [[#^note-26f|vengeance]], with [[#^note-26g|devouring fire]]. ^verse-26

**27**  Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of her offering; and if she sin no more [[#^note-27a|none]] of these things shall come upon her; ^verse-27

**28**  And I will bless her with [[#^note-28a|blessings]], and multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon her, and upon her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord your God. Amen. ^verse-28
