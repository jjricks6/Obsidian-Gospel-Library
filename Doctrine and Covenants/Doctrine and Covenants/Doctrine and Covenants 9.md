*1-6, Other ancient records are yet to be translated; 7-14, The Book of Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not [[#^note-1a|translate]] according to that which you desired of me, and did commence again to [[#^note-1b|write]] for my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him. ^verse-1

**2**  And then, behold, [[#^note-2a|other]] [[#^note-2b|records]] have I, that I will give unto you power that you may assist to [[#^note-2c|translate]]. ^verse-2

**3**  Be patient, my son, for it is [[#^note-3a|wisdom]] in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, the work which you are called to do is to [[#^note-4a|write]] for my servant Joseph. ^verse-4

**5**  And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you. ^verse-5

**6**  Do not [[#^note-6a|murmur]], my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. ^verse-7

**8**  But, behold, I say unto you, that you must [[#^note-8a|study]] it out in your [[#^note-8b|mind]]; then you must [[#^note-8c|ask]] me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your [[#^note-8d|bosom]] shall [[#^note-8e|burn]] within you; therefore, you shall [[#^note-8f|feel]] that it is right. ^verse-8

**9**  But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a [[#^note-9a|stupor]] of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is [[#^note-9b|sacred]] save it be given you from me. ^verse-9

**10**  Now, if you had known this you could have [[#^note-10a|translated]]; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should translate now. ^verse-10

**11**  Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you [[#^note-11a|feared]], and the time is past, and it is not expedient now; ^verse-11

**12**  For, do you not behold that I have [[#^note-12a|given]] unto my servant [[#^note-12b|Joseph]] sufficient strength, whereby it is made up? And neither of you have I condemned. ^verse-12

**13**  Do this thing which I have commanded you, and you shall [[#^note-13a|prosper]]. Be faithful, and yield to no [[#^note-13b|temptation]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Stand fast in the [[#^note-14a|work]] wherewith I have [[#^note-14b|called]] you, and a hair of your head shall not be lost, and you shall be [[#^note-14c|lifted up]] at the last day. Amen. ^verse-14
