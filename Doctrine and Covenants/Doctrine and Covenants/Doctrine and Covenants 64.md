*1-11, The Saints are commanded to forgive one another, lest there remain in them the greater sin; 12-22, The unrepentant are to be brought before the Church; 23-25, He that is tithed will not be burned at the Lord's coming; 26-32, The Saints are warned against debt; 33-36, The rebellious will be cut off out of Zion; 37-40, The Church will judge the nations; 41-43, Zion will flourish.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my [[#^note-1a|church]], hearken ye and hear, and receive my will concerning you. ^verse-1

**2**  For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should [[#^note-2a|overcome]] the world; wherefore I will have [[#^note-2b|compassion]] upon you. ^verse-2

**3**  There are those among you who have sinned; but verily I say, for this once, for mine own [[#^note-3a|glory]], and for the salvation of souls, I have [[#^note-3b|forgiven]] you your sins. ^verse-3

**4**  I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the [[#^note-4a|kingdom]]. ^verse-4

**5**  And the [[#^note-5a|keys]] of the mysteries of the kingdom shall not be taken from my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., through the means I have appointed, while he liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine [[#^note-5b|ordinances]]. ^verse-5

**6**  There are those who have sought occasion against him without cause; ^verse-6

**7**  Nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, [[#^note-7a|forgive]] sins unto those who [[#^note-7b|confess]] their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not [[#^note-7c|sinned]] unto [[#^note-7d|death]]. ^verse-7

**8**  My disciples, in days of old, sought [[#^note-8a|occasion]] against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this [[#^note-8b|evil]] they were [[#^note-8c|afflicted]] and sorely [[#^note-8d|chastened]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to [[#^note-9a|forgive]] one another; for he that [[#^note-9b|forgiveth]] not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin. ^verse-9

**10**  I, the Lord, will [[#^note-10a|forgive]] whom I will [[#^note-10b|forgive]], but of you it is required to forgive all men. ^verse-10

**11**  And ye ought to say in your hearts—let God [[#^note-11a|judge]] between me and thee, and [[#^note-11b|reward]] thee according to thy [[#^note-11c|deeds]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And him that [[#^note-12a|repenteth]] not of his sins, and [[#^note-12b|confesseth]] them not, ye shall bring before the [[#^note-12c|church]], and do with him as the [[#^note-12d|scripture]] saith unto you, either by commandment or by revelation. ^verse-12

**13**  And this ye shall do that God may be glorified—not because ye forgive not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes of the law, that ye may not [[#^note-13a|offend]] him who is your lawgiver— ^verse-13

**14**  Verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these things. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, I, the Lord, was angry with him who was my servant Ezra Booth, and also my servant Isaac Morley, for they [[#^note-15a|kept]] not the law, neither the commandment; ^verse-15

**16**  They sought [[#^note-16a|evil]] in their hearts, and I, the Lord, [[#^note-16b|withheld]] my Spirit. They [[#^note-16c|condemned]] for evil that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley. ^verse-16

**17**  And also my servant [[#^note-17a|Edward Partridge]], behold, he hath sinned, and [[#^note-17b|Satan]] seeketh to destroy his soul; but when these things are made known unto them, and they repent of the evil, they shall be forgiven. ^verse-17

**18**  And now, verily I say that it is expedient in me that my servant Sidney Gilbert, after a few weeks, shall return upon his business, and to his [[#^note-18a|agency]] in the land of Zion; ^verse-18

**19**  And that which he hath seen and heard may be made known unto my disciples, that they perish not. And for this cause have I spoken these things. ^verse-19

**20**  And again, I say unto you, that my servant Isaac Morley may not be [[#^note-20a|tempted]] above that which he is able to bear, and counsel wrongfully to your hurt, I gave commandment that his farm should be sold. ^verse-20

**21**  I will not that my servant Frederick G. Williams should sell his farm, for I, the Lord, will to retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years, in the which I will not overthrow the wicked, that thereby I may save some. ^verse-21

**22**  And after that day, I, the Lord, will not hold any [[#^note-22a|guilty]] that shall go with an open heart up to the land of Zion; for I, the Lord, require the [[#^note-22b|hearts]] of the children of men. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold, now it is called [[#^note-23a|today]] until the [[#^note-23b|coming]] of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of [[#^note-23c|sacrifice]], and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is [[#^note-23d|tithed]] shall not be [[#^note-23e|burned]] at his coming. ^verse-23

**24**  For after today cometh the [[#^note-24a|burning]]—this is speaking after the manner of the Lord—for verily I say, tomorrow all the [[#^note-24b|proud]] and they that do wickedly shall be as [[#^note-24c|stubble]]; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not [[#^note-24d|spare]] any that remain in [[#^note-24e|Babylon]]. ^verse-24

**25**  Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called [[#^note-25a|today]]. ^verse-25

**26**  And it is not meet that my servants, [[#^note-26a|Newel K. Whitney]] and Sidney Gilbert, should sell their [[#^note-26b|store]] and their possessions here; for this is not wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion. ^verse-26

**27**  Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to get in [[#^note-27a|debt]] to thine enemies; ^verse-27

**28**  But behold, it is not said at any time that the Lord should not take when he please, and pay as seemeth him good. ^verse-28

**29**  Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord's errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord's business. ^verse-29

**30**  And he hath set you to provide for his saints in these last days, that they may obtain an [[#^note-30a|inheritance]] in the land of Zion. ^verse-30

**31**  And behold, I, the Lord, declare unto you, and my [[#^note-31a|words]] are sure and shall not [[#^note-31b|fail]], that they shall obtain it. ^verse-31

**32**  But all things must come to pass in their time. ^verse-32

**33**  Wherefore, be not [[#^note-33a|weary]] in [[#^note-33b|well-doing]], for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of [[#^note-33c|small things]] proceedeth that which is great. ^verse-33

**34**  Behold, the Lord [[#^note-34a|requireth]] the [[#^note-34b|heart]] and a [[#^note-34c|willing]] mind; and the willing and [[#^note-34d|obedient]] shall [[#^note-34e|eat]] the good of the land of Zion in these last days. ^verse-34

**35**  And the [[#^note-35a|rebellious]] shall be [[#^note-35b|cut off]] out of the land of Zion, and shall be sent away, and shall not inherit the land. ^verse-35

**36**  For, verily I say that the rebellious are not of the blood of [[#^note-36a|Ephraim]], wherefore they shall be plucked out. ^verse-36

**37**  Behold, I, the Lord, have made my church in these last days like unto a [[#^note-37a|judge]] sitting on a hill, or in a high place, to [[#^note-37b|judge]] the nations. ^verse-37

**38**  For it shall come to pass that the inhabitants of Zion shall [[#^note-38a|judge]] all things pertaining to Zion. ^verse-38

**39**  And [[#^note-39a|liars]] and hypocrites shall be proved by them, and they who are [[#^note-39b|not]] [[#^note-39c|apostles]] and prophets shall be [[#^note-39d|known]]. ^verse-39

**40**  And even the [[#^note-40a|bishop]], who is a [[#^note-40b|judge]], and his counselors, if they are not faithful in their [[#^note-40c|stewardships]] shall be condemned, and [[#^note-40d|others]] shall be planted in their [[#^note-40e|stead]]. ^verse-40

**41**  For, behold, I say unto you that [[#^note-41a|Zion]] shall flourish, and the [[#^note-41b|glory]] of the Lord shall be upon her; ^verse-41

**42**  And she shall be an [[#^note-42a|ensign]] unto the people, and there shall come unto her out of every [[#^note-42b|nation]] under heaven. ^verse-42

**43**  And the day shall come when the nations of the earth shall [[#^note-43a|tremble]] because of her, and shall fear because of her terrible ones. The Lord hath spoken it. Amen. ^verse-43
