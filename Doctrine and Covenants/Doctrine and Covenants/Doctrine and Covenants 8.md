*1-5, Revelation comes by the power of the Holy Ghost; 6-12, Knowledge of the mysteries of God and the power to translate ancient records come by faith.*

**1**  [[#^note-1a|Oliver Cowdery]], verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a [[#^note-1b|knowledge]] of whatsoever things you shall [[#^note-1c|ask]] in faith, with an [[#^note-1d|honest]] heart, believing that you shall receive a [[#^note-1e|knowledge]] concerning the engravings of old [[#^note-1f|records]], which are ancient, which contain those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken by the [[#^note-1g|manifestation]] of my Spirit. ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, behold, I will [[#^note-2a|tell]] you in your mind and in your [[#^note-2b|heart]], by the [[#^note-2c|Holy Ghost]], which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. ^verse-2

**3**  Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses [[#^note-3a|brought]] the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore this is thy [[#^note-4a|gift]]; apply unto it, and blessed art thou, for it shall [[#^note-4b|deliver]] you out of the hands of your [[#^note-4c|enemies]], when, if it were not so, they would slay you and bring your soul to destruction. ^verse-4

**5**  Oh, remember these [[#^note-5a|words]], and keep my commandments. Remember, this is your gift. ^verse-5

**6**  Now this is not all thy [[#^note-6a|gift]]; for you have another gift, which is the gift of Aaron; behold, it has told you many things; ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, there is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be with you. ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore, [[#^note-8a|doubt]] not, for it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your hands, and do marvelous [[#^note-8b|work]]s; and no power shall be able to take it away out of your hands, for it is the work of God. ^verse-8

**9**  And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that will I grant unto you, and you shall have knowledge concerning it. ^verse-9

**10**  Remember that without [[#^note-10a|faith]] you can do nothing; therefore [[#^note-10b|ask]] in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not. ^verse-10

**11**  Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may [[#^note-11a|translate]] and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are [[#^note-11b|sacred]]; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you. ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, it is I that have spoken it; and I am the same that spake unto you from the beginning. Amen. ^verse-12
