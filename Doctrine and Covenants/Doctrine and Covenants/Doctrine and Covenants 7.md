*1-3, John the Beloved will live until the Lord comes; 4-8, Peter, James, and John hold gospel keys.*

**1**  And the Lord said unto me: [[#^note-1a|John]], my beloved, what [[#^note-1b|desirest]] thou? For if you shall ask what you will, it shall be granted unto you. ^verse-1

**2**  And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me [[#^note-2a|power]] over [[#^note-2b|death]], that I may live and bring souls unto thee. ^verse-2

**3**  And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt [[#^note-3a|tarry]] until I come in my [[#^note-3b|glory]], and shalt [[#^note-3c|prophesy]] before nations, kindreds, tongues and people. ^verse-3

**4**  And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? For he desired of me that he might bring [[#^note-4a|souls]] unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest speedily come unto me in my [[#^note-4b|kingdom]]. ^verse-4

**5**  I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do more, or a greater [[#^note-5a|work]] yet among men than what he has before done. ^verse-5

**6**  Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and a [[#^note-6a|ministering]] angel; he shall minister for those who shall be [[#^note-6b|heirs]] of salvation who dwell on the earth. ^verse-6

**7**  And I will make thee to minister for him and for thy brother James; and unto you three I will [[#^note-7a|give]] this power and the [[#^note-7b|keys]] of this ministry until I come. ^verse-7

**8**  Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both [[#^note-8a|joy]] in that which ye have desired. ^verse-8
