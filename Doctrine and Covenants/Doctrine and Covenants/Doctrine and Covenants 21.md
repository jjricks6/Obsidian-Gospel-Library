*1-3, Joseph Smith is called to be a seer, translator, prophet, apostle, and elder; 4-8, His word will guide the cause of Zion; 9-12, The Saints will believe his words as he speaks by the Comforter.*

**1**    Behold, there shall be a [[#^note-1a|record]] kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a [[#^note-1b|seer]], a translator, a prophet, an [[#^note-1c|apostle]] of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ, ^verse-1

**2**  Being [[#^note-2a|inspired]] of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to [[#^note-2b|build]] it up unto the most holy faith. ^verse-2

**3**  Which [[#^note-3a|church]] was [[#^note-3b|organized]] and established in the year of your Lord eighteen hundred and thirty, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April. ^verse-3

**4**  Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give [[#^note-4a|heed]] unto all his words and [[#^note-4b|commandments]] which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all [[#^note-4c|holiness]] before me; ^verse-4

**5**  For his [[#^note-5a|word]] ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith. ^verse-5

**6**  For by doing these things the [[#^note-6a|gates]] of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of [[#^note-6b|darkness]] from before you, and cause the heavens to [[#^note-6c|shake]] for your [[#^note-6d|good]], and his name's [[#^note-6e|glory]]. ^verse-6

**7**  For thus saith the Lord God: Him have I inspired to move the cause of [[#^note-7a|Zion]] in mighty power for good, and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have heard. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer; for his days of rejoicing are come unto the [[#^note-8a|remission]] of his sins, and the manifestations of my blessings upon his works. ^verse-8

**9**  For, behold, I will [[#^note-9a|bless]] all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they shall believe on his words, which are given him through me by the [[#^note-9b|Comforter]], which [[#^note-9c|manifesteth]] that Jesus was [[#^note-9d|crucified]] by [[#^note-9e|sinful]] men for the sins of the [[#^note-9f|world]], yea, for the remission of sins unto the [[#^note-9g|contrite heart]]. ^verse-9

**10**  Wherefore it behooveth me that he should be [[#^note-10a|ordained]] by you, Oliver Cowdery mine apostle; ^verse-10

**11**  This being an ordinance unto you, that you are an elder under his hand, he being the [[#^note-11a|first]] unto you, that you might be an elder unto this church of Christ, bearing my name— ^verse-11

**12**  And the first [[#^note-12a|preacher]] of this church unto the church, and before the world, yea, before the Gentiles; yea, and thus saith the Lord God, lo, lo! to the [[#^note-12b|Jews]] also. Amen. ^verse-12
