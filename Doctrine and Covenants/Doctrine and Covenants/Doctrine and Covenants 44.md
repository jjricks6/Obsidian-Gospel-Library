*1-3, Elders are to assemble in conference; 4-6, They are to organize according to the laws of the land and to care for the poor.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be [[#^note-1a|called]] together, from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other way. ^verse-1

**2**  And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my [[#^note-2a|Spirit]] upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together. ^verse-2

**3**  And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and [[#^note-3a|preach]] repentance unto the people. ^verse-3

**4**  And many shall be [[#^note-4a|converted]], insomuch that ye shall obtain [[#^note-4b|power]] to organize yourselves [[#^note-4c|according]] to the laws of man; ^verse-4

**5**  That your [[#^note-5a|enemies]] may not have power over you; that you may be preserved in all things; that you may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, I say unto you, that ye must [[#^note-6a|visit]] the poor and the needy and administer to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done according to my law which ye have received. Amen. ^verse-6
