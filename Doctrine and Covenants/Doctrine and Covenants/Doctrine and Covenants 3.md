*1-4, The Lord's course is one eternal round; 5-15, Joseph Smith must repent or lose the gift to translate; 16-20, The Book of Mormon comes forth to save the seed of Lehi.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|works]], and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be [[#^note-1b|frustrated]], neither can they come to naught. ^verse-1

**2**  For God doth not [[#^note-2a|walk]] in crooked paths, neither doth he [[#^note-2b|turn]] to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his [[#^note-2c|course]] is one eternal round. ^verse-2

**3**  Remember, remember that it is not the [[#^note-3a|work]] of God that is frustrated, but the work of men; ^verse-3

**4**  For although a man may have many [[#^note-4a|revelations]], and have [[#^note-4b|power]] to do many mighty works, yet if he [[#^note-4c|boasts]] in his own [[#^note-4d|strength]], and sets at naught the [[#^note-4e|counsels]] of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and [[#^note-4f|carnal]] desires, he must fall and incur the [[#^note-4g|vengeance]] of a [[#^note-4h|just]] God upon him. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, you have been [[#^note-5a|entrusted]] with these things, but how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were made to you, if you did not transgress them. ^verse-5

**6**  And behold, how [[#^note-6a|oft]] you have [[#^note-6b|transgressed]] the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the [[#^note-6c|persuasions]] of men. ^verse-6

**7**  For, behold, you should not have [[#^note-7a|feared]] man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and [[#^note-7b|despise]] his words— ^verse-7

**8**  Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and [[#^note-8a|supported]] you against all the fiery [[#^note-8b|darts]] of the [[#^note-8c|adversary]]; and he would have been with you in every time of [[#^note-8d|trouble]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt [[#^note-9a|fall]]. ^verse-9

**10**  But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art [[#^note-10a|again]] called to the work; ^verse-10

**11**  Except thou [[#^note-11a|do]] this, thou shalt be delivered up and become as other men, and have no more gift. ^verse-11

**12**  And when thou deliveredst up that which God had given thee sight and power to [[#^note-12a|translate]], thou deliveredst up that which was [[#^note-12b|sacred]] into the hands of a wicked [[#^note-12c|man]], ^verse-12

**13**  Who has set at naught the counsels of God, and has broken the most sacred promises which were made before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and [[#^note-13a|boasted]] in his own wisdom. ^verse-13

**14**  And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy privileges for a season— ^verse-14

**15**  For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy [[#^note-15a|director]] to be trampled upon from the beginning. ^verse-15

**16**  Nevertheless, my [[#^note-16a|work]] shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the world, through the [[#^note-16b|testimony]] of the Jews, even so shall the [[#^note-16c|knowledge]] of a [[#^note-16d|Savior]] come unto my people— ^verse-16

**17**  And to the [[#^note-17a|Nephites]], and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers— ^verse-17

**18**  And this [[#^note-18a|testimony]] shall come to the knowledge of the [[#^note-18b|Lamanites]], and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who [[#^note-18c|dwindled]] in unbelief because of the [[#^note-18d|iniquity]] of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their [[#^note-18e|brethren]] the Nephites, because of their [[#^note-18f|iniquities]] and their abominations. ^verse-18

**19**  And for this very [[#^note-19a|purpose]] are these [[#^note-19b|plates]] [[#^note-19c|preserved]], which contain these records—that the [[#^note-19d|promises]] of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to his [[#^note-19e|people]]; ^verse-19

**20**  And that the [[#^note-20a|Lamanites]] might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the [[#^note-20b|promises]] of the Lord, and that they may [[#^note-20c|believe]] the gospel and [[#^note-20d|rely]] upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be [[#^note-20e|glorified]] through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. Amen. ^verse-20
