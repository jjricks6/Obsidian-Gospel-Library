*1-10, The Twelve are to send the gospel and raise the warning voice to all nations and people; 11-15, They are to take up their cross, follow Jesus, and feed His sheep; 16-20, Those who receive the First Presidency receive the Lord; 21-29, Darkness covers the earth, and only those who believe and are baptized will be saved; 30-34, The First Presidency and the Twelve hold the keys of the dispensation of the fulness of times.*

**1**  Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Thomas: I have heard thy prayers; and thine [[#^note-1a|alms]] have come up as a [[#^note-1b|memorial]] before me, in behalf of those, thy brethren, who were chosen to bear testimony of my name and to [[#^note-1c|send]] it abroad among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and ordained through the instrumentality of my servants. ^verse-1

**2**  Verily I say unto you, there have been some few things in thine heart and with thee with which I, the Lord, was not well pleased. ^verse-2

**3**  Nevertheless, inasmuch as thou hast [[#^note-3a|abased]] thyself thou shalt be exalted; therefore, all thy sins are forgiven thee. ^verse-3

**4**  Let thy heart be of good [[#^note-4a|cheer]] before my face; and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only unto the [[#^note-4b|Gentiles]], but also unto the Jews; and thou shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the earth. ^verse-4

**5**  [[#^note-5a|Contend]] thou, therefore, morning by morning; and day after day let thy [[#^note-5b|warning]] voice go forth; and when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber, because of thy [[#^note-5c|speech]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Let thy habitation be known in Zion, and [[#^note-6a|remove]] not thy house; for I, the Lord, have a great work for thee to do, in publishing my name among the children of men. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore, [[#^note-7a|gird]] up thy loins for the work. Let thy feet be shod also, for thou art chosen, and thy path lieth among the mountains, and among many nations. ^verse-7

**8**  And by thy word many high ones shall be brought low, and by thy word many low ones shall be [[#^note-8a|exalted]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Thy voice shall be a [[#^note-9a|rebuke]] unto the transgressor; and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the slanderer cease its perverseness. ^verse-9

**10**    Be thou [[#^note-10a|humble]]; and the Lord thy God shall [[#^note-10b|lead]] thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers. ^verse-10

**11**  I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them in [[#^note-11a|love]] above many others, but let thy love be for them as for thyself; and let thy love abound unto all men, and unto all who love my name. ^verse-11

**12**  And pray for thy brethren of the Twelve. [[#^note-12a|Admonish]] them sharply for my [[#^note-12b|name]]'s sake, and let them be admonished for all their sins, and be ye faithful before me unto my name. ^verse-12

**13**  And after their [[#^note-13a|temptations]], and much [[#^note-13b|tribulation]], behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and [[#^note-13c|stiffen]] not their necks against me, they shall be [[#^note-13d|converted]], and I will heal them. ^verse-13

**14**  Now, I say unto you, and what I say unto you, I say unto all the Twelve: Arise and gird up your loins, take up your [[#^note-14a|cross]], follow me, and [[#^note-14b|feed]] my sheep. ^verse-14

**15**  Exalt not yourselves; [[#^note-15a|rebel]] not against my servant Joseph; for verily I say unto you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over him; and the [[#^note-15b|keys]] which I have given unto him, and also to youward, shall not be taken from him till I come. ^verse-15

**16**  Verily I say unto you, my servant Thomas, thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold the [[#^note-16a|keys]] of my kingdom, as pertaining to the Twelve, abroad among all nations— ^verse-16

**17**  That thou mayest be my servant to unlock the door of the kingdom in all places where my servant Joseph, and my servant Sidney, and my servant Hyrum, [[#^note-17a|cannot]] come; ^verse-17

**18**  For on them have I laid the burden of all the churches for a little season. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, whithersoever they shall send you, go ye, and I will be with you; and in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name an [[#^note-19a|effectual]] door shall be opened unto you, that they may receive my word. ^verse-19

**20**  Whosoever [[#^note-20a|receiveth]] my word receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth those, the First Presidency, whom I have sent, whom I have made counselors for my name's sake unto you. ^verse-20

**21**  And again, I say unto you, that whosoever ye shall send in my name, by the voice of your brethren, the [[#^note-21a|Twelve]], duly recommended and [[#^note-21b|authorized]] by you, shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation whithersoever ye shall send them— ^verse-21

**22**  Inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before me, and abide in my word, and [[#^note-22a|hearken]] to the voice of my Spirit. ^verse-22

**23**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, [[#^note-23a|darkness]] covereth the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the people, and all flesh has become [[#^note-23b|corrupt]] before my face. ^verse-23

**24**  Behold, [[#^note-24a|vengeance]] cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of [[#^note-24b|desolation]], of [[#^note-24c|weeping]], of mourning, and of lamentation; and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth, saith the Lord. ^verse-24

**25**  And upon my [[#^note-25a|house]] shall it [[#^note-25b|begin]], and from my house shall it go forth, saith the Lord; ^verse-25

**26**  First among those among you, saith the Lord, who have [[#^note-26a|professed]] to know my [[#^note-26b|name]] and have not [[#^note-26c|known]] me, and have [[#^note-26d|blasphemed]] against me in the midst of my house, saith the Lord. ^verse-26

**27**  Therefore, see to it that ye trouble not yourselves concern[[#^note-27a|in]]g the affairs of my church in this place, saith the Lord. ^verse-27

**28**  But [[#^note-28a|purify]] your hearts before me; and then [[#^note-28b|go]] ye into all the world, and preach my gospel unto every creature who has not received it; ^verse-28

**29**  And he that [[#^note-29a|believeth]] and is [[#^note-29b|baptized]] shall be saved, and he that believeth not, and is not baptized, shall be [[#^note-29c|damned]]. ^verse-29

**30**  For unto you, the [[#^note-30a|Twelve]], and those, the First Presidency, who are appointed with you to be your [[#^note-30b|counselors]] and your leaders, is the [[#^note-30c|power]] of this priesthood given, for the last days and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the [[#^note-30d|fulness]] of times, ^verse-30

**31**  Which power you hold, in connection with all those who have received a [[#^note-31a|dispensation]] at any time from the beginning of the creation; ^verse-31

**32**  For verily I say unto you, the [[#^note-32a|keys]] of the dispensation, which ye have received, have [[#^note-32b|come]] down from the fathers, and last of all, being sent down from heaven unto you. ^verse-32

**33**  Verily I say unto you, behold how great is your calling. [[#^note-33a|Cleanse]] your hearts and your garments, lest the blood of this generation be [[#^note-33b|required]] at your hands. ^verse-33

**34**  Be faithful until I [[#^note-34a|come]], for I come quickly; and my reward is with me to recompense every man according as his [[#^note-34b|work]] shall be. I am Alpha and Omega. Amen. ^verse-34
