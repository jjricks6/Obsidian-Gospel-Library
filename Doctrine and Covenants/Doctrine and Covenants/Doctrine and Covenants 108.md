*1-3, Lyman Sherman forgiven of his sins; 4-5, He is to be numbered with the leading elders of the Church; 6-8, He is called to preach the gospel and strengthen his brethren.*

**1**  Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my [[#^note-1a|voice]] in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed. ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore, let your soul be at [[#^note-2a|rest]] concerning your spiritual standing, and resist no more my voice. ^verse-2

**3**  And arise up and be more careful henceforth in observing your [[#^note-3a|vows]], which you have made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings. ^verse-3

**4**  Wait patiently until the [[#^note-4a|solemn assembly]] shall be called of my servants, then you shall be remembered with the [[#^note-4b|first]] of mine elders, and receive right by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom I have chosen. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, this is the [[#^note-5a|promise]] of the Father unto you if you continue faithful. ^verse-5

**6**  And it shall be fulfilled upon you in that day that you shall have right to [[#^note-6a|preach]] my gospel wheresoever I shall send you, from henceforth from that time. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore, [[#^note-7a|strengthen]] your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings. ^verse-7

**8**  And behold, and lo, I am with you to bless you and [[#^note-8a|deliver]] you forever. Amen. ^verse-8
