*1-3, Christ has all power; 4-5, All men must repent or suffer; 6-12, Eternal punishment is God's punishment; 13-20, Christ suffered for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; 21-28, Preach the gospel of repentance; 29-41, Declare glad tidings.*

**1**  I am [[#^note-1a|Alpha and Omega]], [[#^note-1b|Christ]] the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer of the [[#^note-1c|world]]. ^verse-1

**2**  I, having accomplished and [[#^note-2a|finished]] the will of him whose I am, even the Father, concerning me—having done this that I might [[#^note-2b|subdue]] all things unto myself— ^verse-2

**3**  Retaining all [[#^note-3a|power]], even to the [[#^note-3b|destroying]] of Satan and his works at the [[#^note-3c|end]] of the world, and the last great day of judgment, which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof, [[#^note-3d|judging]] every man according to his [[#^note-3e|works]] and the deeds which he hath done. ^verse-3

**4**  And surely every man must [[#^note-4a|repent]] or [[#^note-4b|suffer]], for I, God, am [[#^note-4c|endless]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, I [[#^note-5a|revoke]] not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping, [[#^note-5b|wailing]] and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are found on my [[#^note-5c|left]] hand. ^verse-5

**6**  Nevertheless, it is [[#^note-6a|not]] written that there shall be no end to this torment, but it is written [[#^note-6b|endless]] [[#^note-6c|torment]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Again, it is written [[#^note-7a|eternal damnation]]; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men, altogether for my name's glory. ^verse-7

**8**  Wherefore, I will explain unto you this [[#^note-8a|mystery]], for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles. ^verse-8

**9**  I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one, that you may enter into my [[#^note-9a|rest]]. ^verse-9

**10**  For, behold, the [[#^note-10a|mystery]] of godliness, how great is it! For, behold, I am [[#^note-10b|endless]], and the [[#^note-10c|punishment]] which is given from my hand is endless punishment, for [[#^note-10d|Endless]] is my name. Wherefore— ^verse-10

**11**  [[#^note-11a|Eternal]] punishment is God's punishment. ^verse-11

**12**  Endless punishment is God's punishment. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep the [[#^note-13a|commandments]] which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name; ^verse-13

**14**  And it is by my almighty power that you have received them; ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest I [[#^note-15a|smite]] you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your [[#^note-15b|sufferings]] be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not. ^verse-15

**16**  For behold, I, God, have [[#^note-16a|suffered]] these things for all, that they [[#^note-16b|might]] not suffer if they would [[#^note-16c|repent]]; ^verse-16

**17**  But if they would not repent they must [[#^note-17a|suffer]] even as I; ^verse-17

**18**  Which [[#^note-18a|suffering]] caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might [[#^note-18b|not]] drink the bitter cup, and shrink— ^verse-18

**19**  Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and [[#^note-19a|finished]] my preparations unto the children of men. ^verse-19

**20**  Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I [[#^note-20a|humble]] you with my almighty power; and that you [[#^note-20b|confess]] your sins, lest you suffer these [[#^note-20c|punishments]] of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have [[#^note-20d|tasted]] at the time I withdrew my Spirit. ^verse-20

**21**  And I command you that you [[#^note-21a|preach]] naught but repentance, and show [[#^note-21b|not]] these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me. ^verse-21

**22**  For they cannot [[#^note-22a|bear]] meat now, but [[#^note-22b|milk]] they must receive; wherefore, they must not know these things, lest they perish. ^verse-22

**23**  [[#^note-23a|Learn]] of me, and listen to my words; [[#^note-23b|walk]] in the [[#^note-23c|meekness]] of my Spirit, and you shall have [[#^note-23d|peace]] in me. ^verse-23

**24**  I am Jesus Christ; I [[#^note-24a|came]] by the [[#^note-24b|will]] of the Father, and I do his will. ^verse-24

**25**  And again, I command thee that thou shalt not [[#^note-25a|covet]] thy [[#^note-25b|neighbor's]] [[#^note-25c|wife]]; nor seek thy neighbor's life. ^verse-25

**26**  And again, I command thee that thou shalt not [[#^note-26a|covet]] thine own property, but impart it freely to the printing of the Book of Mormon, which contains the [[#^note-26b|truth]] and the word of God— ^verse-26

**27**  Which is my word to the [[#^note-27a|Gentile]], that soon it may go to the [[#^note-27b|Jew]], of whom the Lamanites are a [[#^note-27c|remnant]], that they may believe the gospel, and look not for a [[#^note-27d|Messiah]] to come who has already come. ^verse-27

**28**  And again, I command thee that thou shalt [[#^note-28a|pray]] [[#^note-28b|vocally]] as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private. ^verse-28

**29**  And thou shalt [[#^note-29a|declare]] glad tidings, yea, [[#^note-29b|publish]] it upon the mountains, and upon every high place, and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see. ^verse-29

**30**  And thou shalt do it with all humility, [[#^note-30a|trusting]] in me, [[#^note-30b|reviling]] not against revilers. ^verse-30

**31**  And of [[#^note-31a|tenets]] thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and [[#^note-31b|faith]] on the Savior, and [[#^note-31c|remission]] of sins by [[#^note-31d|baptism]], and by [[#^note-31e|fire]], yea, even the [[#^note-31f|Holy Ghost]]. ^verse-31

**32**  Behold, this is a great and the last [[#^note-32a|commandment]] which I shall give unto you concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk, even unto the end of thy life. ^verse-32

**33**  And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these [[#^note-33a|counsels]], yea, even the destruction of thyself and property. ^verse-33

**34**  [[#^note-34a|Impart]] a portion of thy property, yea, even part of thy lands, and all save the support of thy [[#^note-34b|family]]. ^verse-34

**35**  Pay the [[#^note-35a|debt]] thou hast [[#^note-35b|contracted]] with the printer. Release thyself from [[#^note-35c|bondage]]. ^verse-35

**36**  [[#^note-36a|Leave]] thy house and home, except when thou shalt desire to see thy family; ^verse-36

**37**  And [[#^note-37a|speak]] freely to all; yea, preach, exhort, declare the [[#^note-37b|truth]], even with a loud voice, with a sound of rejoicing, crying—Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be the name of the Lord God! ^verse-37

**38**  [[#^note-38a|Pray]] always, and I will [[#^note-38b|pour out]] my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing—yea, even more than if you should obtain [[#^note-38c|treasures]] of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof. ^verse-38

**39**  Behold, canst thou read this without [[#^note-39a|rejoicing]] and lifting up thy heart for [[#^note-39b|gladness]]? ^verse-39

**40**  Or canst thou run about longer as a [[#^note-40a|blind]] guide? ^verse-40

**41**  Or canst thou be [[#^note-41a|humble]] and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me? Yea, [[#^note-41b|come]] unto me thy Savior. Amen. ^verse-41
