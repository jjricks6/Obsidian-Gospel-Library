*1-6, The Stem of Jesse, the rod coming therefrom, and the root of Jesse are identified; 7-10, The scattered remnants of Zion have a right to the priesthood and are called to return to the Lord.*

**1**  Who is the [[#^note-1a|Stem of Jesse]] spoken of in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th verses of the 11th chapter of Isaiah? ^verse-1

**2**  Verily thus saith the Lord: It is Christ. ^verse-2

**3**  What is the [[#^note-3a|rod]] spoken of in the first verse of the 11th chapter of Isaiah, that should come of the Stem of Jesse? ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, thus saith the Lord: It is a servant in the hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of Jesse as well as of [[#^note-4a|Ephraim]], or of the house of Joseph, on whom there is laid much [[#^note-4b|power]]. ^verse-4

**5**  What is the [[#^note-5a|root of Jesse]] spoken of in the 10th verse of the 11th chapter? ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, thus saith the Lord, it is a [[#^note-6a|descendant]] of Jesse, as well as of Joseph, unto whom rightly belongs the [[#^note-6b|priesthood]], and the [[#^note-6c|keys]] of the kingdom, for an [[#^note-6d|ensign]], and for the gathering of my people in the [[#^note-6e|last days]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Questions by Elias Higbee: What is meant by the command in Isaiah, 52d chapter, 1st verse, which saith: Put on thy strength, O Zionâ€”and what people had Isaiah reference to? ^verse-7

**8**  He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should hold the [[#^note-8a|power]] of [[#^note-8b|priesthood]] to bring again [[#^note-8c|Zion]], and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her [[#^note-8d|strength]] is to put on the [[#^note-8e|authority]] of the [[#^note-8f|priesthood]], which she, Zion, has a [[#^note-8g|right]] to by lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost. ^verse-8

**9**  What are we to understand by Zion loosing herself from the bands of her neck; 2d verse? ^verse-9

**10**  We are to understand that the [[#^note-10a|scattered]] [[#^note-10b|remnants]] are exhorted to [[#^note-10c|return]] to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The [[#^note-10d|bands]] of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles. ^verse-10
