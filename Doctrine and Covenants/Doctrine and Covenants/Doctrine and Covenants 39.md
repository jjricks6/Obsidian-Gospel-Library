*1-4, The Saints have power to become the sons of God; 5-6, To receive the gospel is to receive Christ; 7-14, James Covel is commanded to be baptized and labor in the Lord's vineyard; 15-21, The Lord's servants are to preach the gospel before the Second Coming; 22-24, Those who receive the gospel will be gathered in time and in eternity.*

**1**  Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is from all [[#^note-1a|eternity]] to all eternity, the Great [[#^note-1b|I Am]], even Jesus Christ— ^verse-1

**2**  The [[#^note-2a|light]] and the life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not; ^verse-2

**3**  The same which came in the [[#^note-3a|meridian of time]] unto mine own, and mine own [[#^note-3b|received me not]]; ^verse-3

**4**  But to as many as received me, gave I power to become my [[#^note-4a|sons]]; and even so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons. ^verse-4

**5**  And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that [[#^note-5a|receiveth]] my gospel [[#^note-5b|receiveth]] me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me. ^verse-5

**6**  And this is my [[#^note-6a|gospel]]—repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the [[#^note-6b|baptism of fire]] and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and [[#^note-6c|teacheth]] the peaceable things of the kingdom. ^verse-6

**7**  And now, behold, I say unto you, my servant [[#^note-7a|James]], I have looked upon thy works and I [[#^note-7b|know]] thee. ^verse-7

**8**  And verily I say unto thee, thine heart is now right before me at this time; and, behold, I have bestowed great [[#^note-8a|blessings]] upon thy head; ^verse-8

**9**  Nevertheless, thou hast seen great [[#^note-9a|sorrow]], for thou hast [[#^note-9b|rejected]] me many times because of pride and the cares of the [[#^note-9c|world]]. ^verse-9

**10**  But, behold, the days of thy [[#^note-10a|deliverance]] are come, if thou wilt [[#^note-10b|hearken]] to my voice, which saith unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and [[#^note-10c|wash]] away your sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive my Spirit, and a blessing so great as you never have known. ^verse-10

**11**  And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the [[#^note-11a|fulness]] of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the [[#^note-11b|covenant]] which I have sent forth to [[#^note-11c|recover]] my people, which are of the house of Israel. ^verse-11

**12**  And it shall come to pass that power shall [[#^note-12a|rest]] upon thee; thou shalt have great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face. ^verse-12

**13**  Thou art called to [[#^note-13a|labor]] in my vineyard, and to [[#^note-13b|build]] up my [[#^note-13c|church]], and to bring forth [[#^note-13d|Zion]], that it may rejoice upon the hills and [[#^note-13e|flourish]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou art not called to go into the eastern countries, but thou art called to go to the Ohio. ^verse-14

**15**  And inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have kept in store a [[#^note-15a|blessing]] such as is not known among the children of men, and it sh[[#^note-15b|all]] be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall go forth into all [[#^note-15c|nations]]. ^verse-15

**16**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the people in Ohio call upon me in much faith, thinking I will [[#^note-16a|stay]] my hand in judgment upon the nations, but I cannot [[#^note-16b|deny]] my word. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore lay to with your might and call faithful laborers into my vineyard, that it may be [[#^note-17a|pruned]] for the last time. ^verse-17

**18**  And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the fulness of my gospel, and become sanctified, I will stay mine hand in [[#^note-18a|judgment]]. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at [[#^note-19a|hand]]; crying: Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High God. ^verse-19

**20**  Go forth [[#^note-20a|baptizing]] with water, preparing the way before my face for the time of my [[#^note-20b|coming]]; ^verse-20

**21**  For the time is at hand; the [[#^note-21a|day]] or the hour no man [[#^note-21b|knoweth]]; but it surely shall [[#^note-21c|come]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And he that receiveth these things receiveth me; and they shall be [[#^note-22a|gathered]] unto me in time and in eternity. ^verse-22

**23**  And again, it shall come to pass that on as many as ye shall baptize with water, ye shall lay your [[#^note-23a|hands]], and they shall receive the [[#^note-23b|gift]] of the Holy Ghost, and shall be [[#^note-23c|looking]] forth for the signs of my [[#^note-23d|coming]], and shall know me. ^verse-23

**24**  Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen. ^verse-24
