*1-6, The Saints are chastened for their failure to build the house of the Lord; 7-10, The Lord desires to use His house to endow His people with power from on high; 11-17, The house is to be dedicated as a place of worship and for the school of the Apostles.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I [[#^note-1a|love]], and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be [[#^note-1b|forgiven]], for with the [[#^note-1c|chastisement]] I prepare a way for their [[#^note-1d|deliverance]] in all things out of [[#^note-1e|temptation]], and I have loved you— ^verse-1

**2**  Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face; ^verse-2

**3**  For ye have sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things, that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine [[#^note-3a|house]]; ^verse-3

**4**  For the preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to [[#^note-4a|prune]] my vineyard for the last time, that I may bring to pass my [[#^note-4b|strange act]], that I may [[#^note-4c|pour out]] my Spirit upon all flesh— ^verse-4

**5**  But behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained among you, whom I have called but few of them are [[#^note-5a|chosen]]. ^verse-5

**6**  They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are [[#^note-6a|walking]] in [[#^note-6b|darkness]] at noon-day. ^verse-6

**7**  And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your [[#^note-7a|solemn assembly]], that your [[#^note-7b|fastings]] and your [[#^note-7c|mourning]] might come up into the ears of the Lord of [[#^note-7d|Sabaoth]], which is by interpretation, the [[#^note-7e|creator]] of the first day, the beginning and the end. ^verse-7

**8**    Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should [[#^note-8a|build]] a house, in the which house I design to [[#^note-8b|endow]] those whom I have [[#^note-8c|chosen]] with power from on high; ^verse-8

**9**  For this is the [[#^note-9a|promise]] of the Father unto you; therefore I command you to tarry, even as mine apostles at Jerusalem. ^verse-9

**10**  Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and [[#^note-10a|contentions]] arose in the [[#^note-10b|school]] of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me, saith your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened. ^verse-10

**11**  Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house. [[#^note-11a|If]] you keep my commandments you shall have power to build it. ^verse-11

**12**  If you [[#^note-12a|keep]] not my commandments, the [[#^note-12b|love]] of the Father shall not continue with you, therefore you shall [[#^note-12c|walk]] in darkness. ^verse-12

**13**  Now here is wisdom, and the [[#^note-13a|mind]] of the Lord—let the house be built, not after the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live after the manner of the world; ^verse-13

**14**  Therefore, let it be built after the [[#^note-14a|manner]] which I shall show unto three of you, whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power. ^verse-14

**15**  And the size thereof shall be fifty and five feet in width, and let it be sixty-five feet in length, in the inner court thereof. ^verse-15

**16**  And let the lower part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for your sacrament [[#^note-16a|offering]], and for your preaching, and your fasting, and your praying, and the offering up of your most holy desires unto me, saith your Lord. ^verse-16

**17**  And let the higher part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for the [[#^note-17a|school]] of mine apostles, saith Son [[#^note-17b|Ahman]]; or, in other words, Alphus; or, in other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your [[#^note-17c|Lord]]. Amen. ^verse-17
