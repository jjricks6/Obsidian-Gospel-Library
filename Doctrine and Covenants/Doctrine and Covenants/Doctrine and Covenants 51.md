*1-8, Edward Partridge is appointed to regulate stewardships and properties; 9-12, The Saints are to deal honestly and receive alike; 13-15, They are to have a bishop's storehouse and to organize properties according to the Lord's law; 16-20, Ohio is to be a temporary gathering place.*

**1**  Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I will speak unto my servant [[#^note-1a|Edward Partridge]], and give unto him directions; for it must needs be that he receive directions how to organize this people. ^verse-1

**2**  For it must needs be that they be [[#^note-2a|organized]] according to my [[#^note-2b|laws]]; if otherwise, they will be cut off. ^verse-2

**3**  Wherefore, let my servant Edward Partridge, and those whom he has chosen, in whom I am well pleased, appoint unto this people their [[#^note-3a|portions]], every man [[#^note-3b|equal]] according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and [[#^note-3c|needs]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his [[#^note-4a|portion]], give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according to the [[#^note-4b|laws]] and [[#^note-4c|covenants]] of the church, to belong to the church. ^verse-4

**5**  And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have power to [[#^note-5a|claim]] that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall only have [[#^note-5b|claim]] on that portion that is deeded unto him. ^verse-5

**6**  And thus all things shall be made sure, [[#^note-6a|according]] to the [[#^note-6b|laws]] of the land. ^verse-6

**7**  And let that which belongs to this people be appointed unto this people. ^verse-7

**8**  And the [[#^note-8a|money]] which is left unto this peopleâ€”let there be an [[#^note-8b|agent]] appointed unto this people, to take the [[#^note-8c|money]] to provide food and raiment, according to the wants of this people. ^verse-8

**9**  And let every man deal [[#^note-9a|honestly]], and be alike among this people, and receive alike, that ye may be [[#^note-9b|one]], even as I have commanded you. ^verse-9

**10**  And let that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto that of [[#^note-10a|another church]]. ^verse-10

**11**  Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let them [[#^note-11a|pay]] unto this church again according as they shall agree; ^verse-11

**12**  And this shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be appointed by the [[#^note-12a|voice]] of the church. ^verse-12

**13**  And again, let the bishop appoint a [[#^note-13a|storehouse]] unto this church; and let all things both in money and in meat, which are more than is [[#^note-13b|needful]] for the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop. ^verse-13

**14**  And let him also reserve unto [[#^note-14a|himself]] for his own wants, and for the wants of his family, as he shall be employed in doing this business. ^verse-14

**15**  And thus I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves according to my [[#^note-15a|laws]]. ^verse-15

**16**  And I consecrate unto them this land for a [[#^note-16a|little season]], until I, the Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence; ^verse-16

**17**  And the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act upon this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good. ^verse-17

**18**  Behold, this shall be [[#^note-18a|an example]] unto my servant Edward Partridge, in other places, in all churches. ^verse-18

**19**  And whoso is found a [[#^note-19a|faithful]], a [[#^note-19b|just]], and a wise [[#^note-19c|steward]] shall enter into the [[#^note-19d|joy]] of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life. ^verse-19

**20**  Verily, I say unto you, I am Jesus Christ, who [[#^note-20a|cometh]] quickly, in an [[#^note-20b|hour]] you think not. Even so. Amen. ^verse-20
