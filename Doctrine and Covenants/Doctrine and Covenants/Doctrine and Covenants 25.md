**1**  Hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, while I speak unto you, Emma Smith, my daughter; for verily I say unto you, all those who [[#^note-1a|receive]] my gospel are sons and daughters in my [[#^note-1b|kingdom]]. ^verse-1

**2**  A revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful and [[#^note-2a|walk]] in the paths of [[#^note-2b|virtue]] before me, I will preserve thy life, and thou shalt receive an [[#^note-2c|inheritance]] in Zion. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, thy [[#^note-3a|sins]] are forgiven thee, and thou art an [[#^note-3b|elect]] [[#^note-3c|lady]], whom I have [[#^note-3d|called]]. ^verse-3

**4**  [[#^note-4a|Murmur]] not because of the [[#^note-4b|things]] which thou hast not seen, for they are [[#^note-4c|withheld]] from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come. ^verse-4

**5**  And the office of thy calling shall be for a [[#^note-5a|comfort]] unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy [[#^note-5b|husband]], in his [[#^note-5c|afflictions]], with consoling words, in the spirit of [[#^note-5d|meekness]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And thou shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a scribe, while there is no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will. ^verse-6

**7**  And thou shalt be [[#^note-7a|ordained]] under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my [[#^note-7b|Spirit]]. ^verse-7

**8**  For he shall lay his [[#^note-8a|hands]] upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much. ^verse-8

**9**  And thou needest not fear, for thy [[#^note-9a|husband]] shall support thee in the church; for unto them is his [[#^note-9b|calling]], that all things might be [[#^note-9c|revealed]] unto them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith. ^verse-9

**10**  And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the [[#^note-10a|things]] of this [[#^note-10b|world]], and [[#^note-10c|seek]] for the things of a [[#^note-10d|better]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of [[#^note-11a|sacred]] [[#^note-11b|hymns]], as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church. ^verse-11

**12**  For my soul [[#^note-12a|delighteth]] in the [[#^note-12b|song]] of the [[#^note-12c|heart]]; yea, the [[#^note-12d|song]] of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, [[#^note-13a|lift up]] thy heart and [[#^note-13b|rejoice]], and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made. ^verse-13

**14**  Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of [[#^note-14a|pride]]. Let thy soul delight in thy [[#^note-14b|husband]], and the [[#^note-14c|glory]] which shall come upon him. ^verse-14

**15**  Keep my commandments continually, and a [[#^note-15a|crown]] of [[#^note-15b|righteousness]] thou shalt receive. And except thou do this, where I am you [[#^note-15c|cannot]] come. ^verse-15

**16**  And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my [[#^note-16a|voice]] unto all. Amen. ^verse-16
