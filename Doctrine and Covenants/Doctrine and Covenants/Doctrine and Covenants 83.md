*1-4, Women and children have claim upon their husbands and fathers for their support; 5-6, Widows and orphans have claim upon the Church for their support.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the [[#^note-1a|laws]] of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have [[#^note-1b|lost]] their husbands or fathers: ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Women]] have [[#^note-2b|claim]] on their [[#^note-2c|husbands]] for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church. ^verse-2

**3**  And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land. ^verse-3

**4**  All [[#^note-4a|children]] have claim upon their [[#^note-4b|parents]] for their [[#^note-4c|maintenance]] until they are of age. ^verse-4

**5**  And after that, they have [[#^note-5a|claim]] upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's [[#^note-5b|storehouse]], if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances. ^verse-5

**6**  And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and [[#^note-6a|widows]] and orphans shall be provided for, as also the [[#^note-6b|poor]]. Amen. ^verse-6
