*1-5, The Lord looks to the temporal needs of His servants; 6-11, He will deal mercifully with Zion and arrange all things for the good of His servants.*

**1**  I, the Lord your God, am [[#^note-1a|not]] displeased with your coming this journey, notwithstanding your follies. ^verse-1

**2**  I have much [[#^note-2a|treasure]] in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and many people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of Zion, through your instrumentality. ^verse-2

**3**  Therefore, it is expedient that you should form [[#^note-3a|acquaintance]] with men in this city, as you shall be led, and as it shall be given you. ^verse-3

**4**  And it shall come to pass in due time that I will [[#^note-4a|give]] this city into your hands, that you shall have power over it, insomuch that they shall not [[#^note-4b|discover]] your secret parts; and its wealth pertaining to gold and silver shall be yours. ^verse-4

**5**  Concern not yourselves about your [[#^note-5a|debts]], for I will give you power to pay them. ^verse-5

**6**  Concern not yourselves about Zion, for I will deal mercifully with her. ^verse-6

**7**  Tarry in this place, and in the regions round about; ^verse-7

**8**  And the place where it is my will that you should tarry, for the main, shall be signalized unto you by the [[#^note-8a|peace]] and power of my [[#^note-8b|Spirit]], that shall flow unto you. ^verse-8

**9**  This place you may obtain by hire. And inquire diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants and founders of this city; ^verse-9

**10**  For there are more treasures than one for you in this city. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore, be ye as [[#^note-11a|wise]] as serpents and yet without [[#^note-11b|sin]]; and I will order all things for your [[#^note-11c|good]], as fast as ye are able to receive them. Amen. ^verse-11
