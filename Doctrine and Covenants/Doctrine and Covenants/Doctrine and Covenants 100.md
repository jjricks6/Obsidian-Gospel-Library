*1-4, Joseph and Sidney to preach the gospel for the salvation of souls; 5-8, It will be given them in the very hour what they should say; 9-12, Sidney is to be a spokesman and Joseph is to be a revelator and mighty in testimony; 13-17, The Lord will raise up a pure people, and the obedient will be saved.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in [[#^note-1a|mine hands]], and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power. ^verse-1

**2**  Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round about; and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern land. ^verse-3

**4**  Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me for the [[#^note-4a|salvation]] of souls. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; [[#^note-5a|speak]] the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be [[#^note-5b|confounded]] before men; ^verse-5

**6**  For it shall be [[#^note-6a|given]] you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say. ^verse-6

**7**  But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall [[#^note-7a|declare]] whatsoever thing ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness, in all things. ^verse-7

**8**  And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the [[#^note-8a|Holy Ghost]] shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye shall say. ^verse-8

**9**  And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a [[#^note-9a|spokesman]] unto this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph. ^verse-9

**10**  And I will give unto him power to be mighty in [[#^note-10a|testimony]]. ^verse-10

**11**  And I will give unto thee power to be [[#^note-11a|mighty]] in expounding all scriptures, that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a [[#^note-11b|revelator]] unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of all things [[#^note-11c|pertaining]] to the things of my kingdom on the earth. ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end. ^verse-12

**13**  And now I give unto you a word concerning [[#^note-13a|Zion]]. Zion shall be [[#^note-13b|redeemed]], although she is chastened for a little season. ^verse-13

**14**  Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands; and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved. ^verse-14

**15**  Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for [[#^note-15a|all]] things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church. ^verse-15

**16**  For I will raise up unto myself a [[#^note-16a|pure]] people, that will serve me in righteousness; ^verse-16

**17**  And all that [[#^note-17a|call]] upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments, shall be saved. Even so. Amen. ^verse-17
