*1-6, The Saints must keep the gospel covenant to gain mercy; 7-10, They must be patient in tribulation.*

**1**  Behold, thus saith the Lord, even [[#^note-1a|Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, even he who was [[#^note-1b|crucified]] for the sins of the worldâ€” ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you. ^verse-2

**3**  And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly [[#^note-3a|humble]] before me and contrite. ^verse-3

**4**  And as the covenant which they made unto me has been [[#^note-4a|broken]], even so it has become [[#^note-4b|void]] and of none effect. ^verse-4

**5**  And wo to him by whom this [[#^note-5a|offense]] cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea. ^verse-5

**6**  But blessed are they who have kept the [[#^note-6a|covenant]] and observed the [[#^note-6b|commandment]], for they shall obtain [[#^note-6c|mercy]]. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you. ^verse-7

**8**  And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of [[#^note-8a|Missouri]], unto the borders of the Lamanites. ^verse-8

**9**  And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a [[#^note-9a|living]] like unto men, until I prepare a place for you. ^verse-9

**10**  And again, be [[#^note-10a|patient]] in tribulation until I [[#^note-10b|come]]; and, behold, I come quickly, and my [[#^note-10c|reward]] is with me, and they who have [[#^note-10d|sought]] me early shall find [[#^note-10e|rest]] to their souls. Even so. Amen. ^verse-10
