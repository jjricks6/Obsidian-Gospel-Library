*1-3, The Lord hears the prayers of and watches over His elders; 4-9, He challenges the wisest person to duplicate the least of His revelations; 10-14, Faithful elders will be quickened by the Spirit and see the face of God.*

**1**  Behold and hearken, O ye [[#^note-1a|elders]] of my church, who have assembled yourselves together, whose [[#^note-1b|prayers]] I have heard, and whose [[#^note-1c|hearts]] I know, and whose desires have come up before me. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold and lo, mine [[#^note-2a|eyes]] are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in mine [[#^note-2b|hands]], and the riches of eternity are mine to give. ^verse-2

**3**  Ye endeavored to [[#^note-3a|believe]] that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were [[#^note-3b|fears]] in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive. ^verse-3

**4**  And now I, the Lord, give unto you a [[#^note-4a|testimony]] of the truth of these commandments which are lying before you. ^verse-4

**5**  Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his [[#^note-5a|language]] you have known, and his imperfections you have known; and you have sought in your hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language; this you also know. ^verse-5

**6**  Now, seek ye out of the Book of Commandments, even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most [[#^note-6a|wise]] among you; ^verse-6

**7**  Or, if there be any among you that shall make one [[#^note-7a|like]] unto it, then ye are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are true; ^verse-7

**8**  But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye do not [[#^note-8a|bear record]] that they are true. ^verse-8

**9**  For ye know that there is no un[[#^note-9a|righteous]]ness in them, and that which is righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of [[#^note-9b|lights]]. ^verse-9

**10**  And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a [[#^note-10a|promise]] I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you [[#^note-10b|strip]] yourselves from [[#^note-10c|jealousies]] and [[#^note-10d|fears]], and [[#^note-10e|humble]] yourselves before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the [[#^note-10f|veil]] shall be rent and you shall [[#^note-10g|see]] me and know that I amâ€”not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual. ^verse-10

**11**  For no [[#^note-11a|man]] has seen God at any time in the flesh, except quickened by the Spirit of God. ^verse-11

**12**  Neither can any [[#^note-12a|natural man]] abide the presence of God, neither after the carnal mind. ^verse-12

**13**  Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels; wherefore, [[#^note-13a|continue]] in patience until ye are [[#^note-13b|perfected]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Let not your minds [[#^note-14a|turn]] back; and when ye are [[#^note-14b|worthy]], in mine own due time, ye shall see and know that which was conferred upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun. Amen. ^verse-14
