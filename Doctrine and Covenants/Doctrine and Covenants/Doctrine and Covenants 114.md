*1-2, Church positions held by those who are not faithful will be given to others.*

**1**  Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant David W. Patten, that he settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a disposition of his merchandise, that he may [[#^note-1a|perform]] a mission unto me next spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world. ^verse-1

**2**  For verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as there are those among you who [[#^note-2a|deny]] my name, others shall be [[#^note-2b|planted]] in their [[#^note-2c|stead]] and receive their [[#^note-2d|bishopric]]. Amen. ^verse-2
