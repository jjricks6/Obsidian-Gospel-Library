*1-7, The Lord gives the meaning of the parable of the wheat and tares; 8-11, He explains priesthood blessings to those who are lawful heirs according to the flesh.*

**1**  Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, concerning the [[#^note-1a|parable]] of the [[#^note-1b|wheat]] and of the tares: ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, verily I say, the field was the world, and the apostles were the [[#^note-2a|sowers]] of the seed; ^verse-2

**3**  And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the [[#^note-3a|whore]], even [[#^note-3b|Babylon]], that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign—behold he soweth the [[#^note-3c|tares]]; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the [[#^note-3d|church]] into the wilderness. ^verse-3

**4**  But behold, in the [[#^note-4a|last days]], even now while the Lord is beginning to bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender— ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, verily I say unto you, the [[#^note-5a|angels]] are crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to [[#^note-5b|reap]] down the fields; ^verse-5

**6**  But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also. ^verse-6

**7**  Therefore, let the wheat and the [[#^note-7a|tares]] grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be [[#^note-7b|burned]]. ^verse-7

**8**  Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the [[#^note-8a|priesthood]] hath continued through the lineage of your fathers— ^verse-8

**9**  For ye are lawful [[#^note-9a|heirs]], according to the flesh, and have been [[#^note-9b|hid]] from the world with Christ in God— ^verse-9

**10**  Therefore your life and the [[#^note-10a|priesthood]] have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the [[#^note-10b|restoration]] of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began. ^verse-10

**11**  Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my [[#^note-11a|goodness]], a [[#^note-11b|light]] unto the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a [[#^note-11c|savior]] unto my people [[#^note-11d|Israel]]. The Lord hath said it. Amen. ^verse-11
