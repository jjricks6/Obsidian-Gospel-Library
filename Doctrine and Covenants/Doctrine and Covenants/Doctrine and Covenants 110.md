*1-10, The Lord Jehovah appears in glory and accepts the Kirtland Temple as His house; 11-12, Moses and Elias each appear and commit their keys and dispensations; 13-16, Elijah returns and commits the keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi.*

**1**  The [[#^note-1a|veil]] was taken from our minds, and the [[#^note-1b|eyes]] of our [[#^note-1c|understanding]] were opened. ^verse-1

**2**  We [[#^note-2a|saw]] the Lord [[#^note-2b|standing]] upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure [[#^note-2c|gold]], in color like amber. ^verse-2

**3**  His [[#^note-3a|eyes]] were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his [[#^note-3b|countenance]] shone above the brightness of the sun; and his [[#^note-3c|voice]] was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of [[#^note-3d|Jehovah]], saying: ^verse-3

**4**  I am the [[#^note-4a|first]] and the last; I am he who [[#^note-4b|liveth]], I am he who was slain; I am your [[#^note-4c|advocate]] with the Father. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, your sins are [[#^note-5a|forgiven]] you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and [[#^note-5b|rejoice]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have, with their might, [[#^note-6a|built]] this house to my name. ^verse-6

**7**  For behold, I have [[#^note-7a|accepted]] this [[#^note-7b|house]], and my name shall be here; and I will [[#^note-7c|manifest]] myself to my people in mercy in this house. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, I will [[#^note-8a|appear]] unto my servants, and speak unto them with mine own voice, if my people will keep my commandments, and do not [[#^note-8b|pollute]] this [[#^note-8c|holy house]]. ^verse-8

**9**  Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the [[#^note-9a|blessings]] which shall be poured out, and the [[#^note-9b|endowment]] with which my servants have been endowed in this house. ^verse-9

**10**  And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be [[#^note-10a|poured]] out upon the heads of my people. Even so. Amen. ^verse-10

**11**  After this [[#^note-11a|vision]] closed, the heavens were again [[#^note-11b|opened]] unto us; and [[#^note-11c|Moses]] appeared before us, and committed unto us the [[#^note-11d|keys]] of the [[#^note-11e|gathering]] of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the [[#^note-11f|north]]. ^verse-11

**12**  After this, [[#^note-12a|Elias]] appeared, and committed the [[#^note-12b|dispensation]] of the [[#^note-12c|gospel]] of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all [[#^note-12d|generations]] after us should be [[#^note-12e|blessed]]. ^verse-12

**13**  After this [[#^note-13a|vision]] had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for [[#^note-13b|Elijah]] the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said: ^verse-13

**14**  Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi—testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come— ^verse-14

**15**  To [[#^note-15a|turn]] the [[#^note-15b|hearts]] of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse— ^verse-15

**16**  Therefore, the [[#^note-16a|keys]] of this [[#^note-16b|dispensation]] are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful [[#^note-16c|day]] of the Lord is near, even at the doors. ^verse-16
