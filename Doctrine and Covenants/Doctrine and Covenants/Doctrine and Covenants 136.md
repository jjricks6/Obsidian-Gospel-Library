*1-16, How the camp of Israel is to be organized for the westward journey is explained; 17-27, The Saints are commanded to live by numerous gospel standards; 28-33, The Saints should sing, dance, pray, and learn wisdom; 34-42, Prophets are slain so that they might be honored and the wicked condemned.*

**1**  The Word and [[#^note-1a|Will]] of the Lord concerning the Camp of [[#^note-1b|Israel]] in their journeyings to the West: ^verse-1

**2**  Let all the people of [[#^note-2a|The]] Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant and promise to [[#^note-2b|keep]] all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God. ^verse-2

**3**  Let the companies be organized with captains of [[#^note-3a|hundreds]], captains of fifties, and captains of tens, with a president and his two counselors at their head, under the direction of the Twelve [[#^note-3b|Apostles]]. ^verse-3

**4**  And this shall be our [[#^note-4a|covenant]]—that we will [[#^note-4b|walk]] in all the [[#^note-4c|ordinances]] of the Lord. ^verse-4

**5**  Let each company provide themselves with all the teams, wagons, provisions, clothing, and other necessaries for the journey, that they can. ^verse-5

**6**  When the companies are organized let them go to with their [[#^note-6a|might]], to prepare for those who are to tarry. ^verse-6

**7**  Let each company, with their captains and presidents, decide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied and expert men, to take teams, seeds, and farming utensils, to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in spring crops. ^verse-7

**8**  Let each company [[#^note-8a|bear]] an equal proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking the poor, the [[#^note-8b|widows]], the [[#^note-8c|fatherless]], and the families of those who have gone into the army, that the cries of the widow and the [[#^note-8d|fatherless]] come not up into the ears of the Lord against this people. ^verse-8

**9**  Let each company prepare houses, and fields for raising [[#^note-9a|grain]], for those who are to remain behind this season; and this is the will of the Lord concerning his people. ^verse-9

**10**  Let every man use all his influence and property to remove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a [[#^note-10a|stake]] of Zion. ^verse-10

**11**  And if ye do this with a pure heart, in all faithfulness, ye shall be [[#^note-11a|blessed]]; you shall be blessed in your flocks, and in your herds, and in your fields, and in your houses, and in your families. ^verse-11

**12**  Let my servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus Snow organize a company. ^verse-12

**13**  And let my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford Woodruff organize a company. ^verse-13

**14**  Also, let my servants Amasa Lyman and George A. Smith organize a company. ^verse-14

**15**  And appoint presidents, and [[#^note-15a|captains]] of hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens. ^verse-15

**16**  And let my servants that have been appointed go and [[#^note-16a|teach]] this, my will, to the saints, that they may be ready to go to a land of peace. ^verse-16

**17**  Go thy way and do as I have told you, and [[#^note-17a|fear not]] thine enemies; for they shall not have power to stop my work. ^verse-17

**18**  Zion shall be [[#^note-18a|redeemed]] in mine own due time. ^verse-18

**19**  And if any man shall seek to build up himself, and seeketh not my [[#^note-19a|counsel]], he shall have no power, and his [[#^note-19b|folly]] shall be made manifest. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Seek ye]]; and keep all your [[#^note-20b|pledges]] one with another; and [[#^note-20c|covet]] not that which is thy brother's. ^verse-20

**21**  [[#^note-21a|Keep]] yourselves from evil to take the name of the Lord in vain, for I am the Lord your [[#^note-21b|God]], even the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. ^verse-21

**22**  I am he who [[#^note-22a|led]] the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; and my arm is stretched out in the last days, to [[#^note-22b|save]] my people Israel. ^verse-22

**23**  Cease to [[#^note-23a|contend]] one with another; cease to speak [[#^note-23b|evil]] one of another. ^verse-23

**24**  Cease [[#^note-24a|drunkenness]]; and let your words tend to [[#^note-24b|edifying]] one another. ^verse-24

**25**  If thou [[#^note-25a|borrowest]] of thy [[#^note-25b|neighbor]], thou shalt [[#^note-25c|restore]] that which thou hast borrowed; and if thou canst not repay then go straightway and tell thy neighbor, lest he condemn thee. ^verse-25

**26**  If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor has [[#^note-26a|lost]], thou shalt make diligent search till thou shalt [[#^note-26b|deliver]] it to him again. ^verse-26

**27**  Thou shalt be [[#^note-27a|diligent]] in [[#^note-27b|preserving]] what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise [[#^note-27c|steward]]; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward. ^verse-27

**28**  If thou art [[#^note-28a|merry]], [[#^note-28b|praise]] the Lord with singing, with music, with [[#^note-28c|dancing]], and with a [[#^note-28d|prayer]] of praise and [[#^note-28e|thanksgiving]]. ^verse-28

**29**  If thou art [[#^note-29a|sorrowful]], call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be [[#^note-29b|joyful]]. ^verse-29

**30**  Fear not thine [[#^note-30a|enemies]], for they are in mine hands and I will do my pleasure with them. ^verse-30

**31**  My people must be [[#^note-31a|tried]] in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the [[#^note-31b|glory]] that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not [[#^note-31c|bear]] chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom. ^verse-31

**32**  Let him that is [[#^note-32a|ignorant]] [[#^note-32b|learn]] [[#^note-32c|wisdom]] by [[#^note-32d|humbling]] himself and calling upon the Lord his God, that his [[#^note-32e|eyes]] may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened that he may hear; ^verse-32

**33**  For my [[#^note-33a|Spirit]] is sent forth into the world to enlighten the [[#^note-33b|humble]] and contrite, and to the [[#^note-33c|condemnation]] of the ungodly. ^verse-33

**34**  Thy brethren have rejected you and your testimony, even the nation that has [[#^note-34a|driven]] you out; ^verse-34

**35**  And now cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of [[#^note-35a|sorrow]], like a woman that is taken in travail; and their sorrow shall be great unless they speedily repent, yea, very speedily. ^verse-35

**36**  For they [[#^note-36a|killed]] the prophets, and them that were sent unto them; and they have [[#^note-36b|shed]] innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against them. ^verse-36

**37**  Therefore, marvel not at these things, for ye are not yet [[#^note-37a|pure]]; ye can not yet bear my glory; but ye shall behold it if ye are faithful in keeping all my words that I have [[#^note-37b|given]] you, from the days of Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and his apostles, and from Jesus and his apostles to Joseph Smith, whom I did call upon by mine [[#^note-37c|angels]], my ministering servants, and by mine own voice out of the heavens, to bring forth my work; ^verse-37

**38**  Which [[#^note-38a|foundation]] he did lay, and was faithful; and I took him to myself. ^verse-38

**39**  Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should [[#^note-39a|seal]] his [[#^note-39b|testimony]] with his [[#^note-39c|blood]], that he might be [[#^note-39d|honored]] and the wicked might be condemned. ^verse-39

**40**  Have I not delivered you from your [[#^note-40a|enemies]], only in that I have left a witness of my name? ^verse-40

**41**  Now, therefore, hearken, O ye people of my [[#^note-41a|church]]; and ye elders listen together; you have received my [[#^note-41b|kingdom]]. ^verse-41

**42**  Be [[#^note-42a|diligent]] in keeping all my commandments, lest judgments come upon you, and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you. So no more at present. Amen and Amen. ^verse-42
