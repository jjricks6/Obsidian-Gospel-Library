*1-6, A day of wrath will come upon the wicked; 7-12, Signs come by faith; 13-19, The adulterous in heart will deny the faith and be cast into the lake of fire; 20, The faithful will receive an inheritance upon the transfigured earth; 21, A full account of the events on the Mount of Transfiguration has not yet been revealed; 22-23, The obedient receive the mysteries of the kingdom; 24-31, Inheritances in Zion are to be purchased; 32-35, The Lord decrees wars, and the wicked slay the wicked; 36-48, The Saints are to gather to Zion and provide moneys to build it up; 49-54, Blessings are assured the faithful at the Second Coming, in the Resurrection, and during the Millennium; 55-58, This is a day of warning; 59-66, The Lord's name is taken in vain by those who use it without authority.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye [[#^note-1a|people]], and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word of the Lord and his will concerning you. ^verse-1

**2**  Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of him whose anger is [[#^note-2a|kindled]] against the wicked and [[#^note-2b|rebellious]]; ^verse-2

**3**  Who willeth to [[#^note-3a|take]] even them whom he will take, and [[#^note-3b|preserveth]] in life them whom he will preserve; ^verse-3

**4**  Who buildeth up at his own will and [[#^note-4a|pleasure]]; and destroyeth when he pleases, and is able to [[#^note-4b|cast]] the soul down to hell. ^verse-4

**5**  Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it shall be [[#^note-5a|obeyed]]. ^verse-5

**6**  Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the [[#^note-6a|rebellious]] [[#^note-6b|fear]] and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the [[#^note-6c|day]] of wrath shall come upon them as a [[#^note-6d|whirlwind]], and all flesh shall [[#^note-6e|know]] that I am God. ^verse-6

**7**  And he that seeketh [[#^note-7a|signs]] shall see [[#^note-7b|signs]], but not unto salvation. ^verse-7

**8**  Verily, I say unto you, there are those among you who seek signs, and there have been such even from the beginning; ^verse-8

**9**  But, behold, faith cometh not by [[#^note-9a|signs]], but signs follow those that believe. ^verse-9

**10**  Yea, [[#^note-10a|signs]] come by [[#^note-10b|faith]], not by the will of men, nor as they please, but by the will of God. ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, signs come by [[#^note-11a|faith]], unto mighty works, for without faith no man pleaseth God; and with whom God is [[#^note-11b|angry]] he is not well pleased; wherefore, unto such he showeth no signs, only in [[#^note-11c|wrath]] unto their [[#^note-11d|condemnation]]. ^verse-11

**12**  Wherefore, I, the Lord, am not pleased with those among you who have sought after signs and wonders for faith, and not for the good of men unto my glory. ^verse-12

**13**  Nevertheless, I give commandments, and many have turned away from my commandments and have [[#^note-13a|not kept]] them. ^verse-13

**14**  There were among you [[#^note-14a|adulterers]] and adulteresses; some of whom have turned away from you, and others remain with you that hereafter shall be revealed. ^verse-14

**15**  Let such beware and repent speedily, lest judgment shall come upon them as a [[#^note-15a|snare]], and their [[#^note-15b|folly]] shall be made manifest, and their works shall follow them in the eyes of the people. ^verse-15

**16**  And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that [[#^note-16a|looketh]] on a woman to [[#^note-16b|lust after]] her, or if any shall commit [[#^note-16c|adultery]] in their hearts, they shall not have the [[#^note-16d|Spirit]], but shall deny the faith and shall fear. ^verse-16

**17**  Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the [[#^note-17a|fearful]], and the [[#^note-17b|unbelieving]], and all [[#^note-17c|liars]], and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the [[#^note-17d|whoremonger]], and the [[#^note-17e|sorcerer]], shall have their part in that [[#^note-17f|lake]] which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the [[#^note-17g|second death]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Verily I say, that they shall not have part in the [[#^note-18a|first resurrection]]. ^verse-18

**19**  And now behold, I, the Lord, say unto you that ye are not [[#^note-19a|justified]], because these things are among you. ^verse-19

**20**  Nevertheless, he that [[#^note-20a|endureth]] in faith and doeth my [[#^note-20b|will]], the same shall overcome, and shall receive an [[#^note-20c|inheritance]] upon the earth when the day of transfiguration shall come; ^verse-20

**21**  When the [[#^note-21a|earth]] shall be [[#^note-21b|transfigured]], even according to the pattern which was shown unto mine apostles upon the [[#^note-21c|mount]]; of which account the fulness ye have not yet received. ^verse-21

**22**  And now, verily I say unto you, that as I said that I would make known my will unto you, behold I will make it known unto you, [[#^note-22a|not]] by the way of commandment, for there are many who observe not to keep my commandments. ^verse-22

**23**    But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the [[#^note-23a|mysteries]] of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living [[#^note-23b|water]], [[#^note-23c|springing up]] unto everlasting life. ^verse-23

**24**  And now, behold, this is the will of the Lord your God concerning his saints, that they should [[#^note-24a|assemble]] themselves together unto the land of Zion, not in haste, lest there should be confusion, which bringeth pestilence. ^verse-24

**25**  Behold, the land of [[#^note-25a|Zion]]—I, the Lord, hold it in mine own hands; ^verse-25

**26**  Nevertheless, I, the Lord, render unto [[#^note-26a|Cæsar]] the things which are Cæsar's. ^verse-26

**27**  Wherefore, I the Lord will that you should [[#^note-27a|purchase]] the lands, that you may have advantage of the world, that you may have claim on the world, that they may not be [[#^note-27b|stirred up]] unto anger. ^verse-27

**28**  For [[#^note-28a|Satan]] [[#^note-28b|putteth]] it into their hearts to anger against you, and to the shedding of blood. ^verse-28

**29**  Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not be obtained but by [[#^note-29a|purchase]] or by blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you. ^verse-29

**30**  And if by purchase, behold you are blessed; ^verse-30

**31**  And if by [[#^note-31a|blood]], as you are forbidden to shed blood, lo, your enemies are upon you, and ye shall be scourged from city to city, and from synagogue to synagogue, and but [[#^note-31b|few]] shall stand to receive an inheritance. ^verse-31

**32**  I, the Lord, am [[#^note-32a|angry]] with the [[#^note-32b|wicked]]; I am holding my [[#^note-32c|Spirit]] from the inhabitants of the earth. ^verse-32

**33**  I have sworn in my wrath, and [[#^note-33a|decreed wars]] upon the face of the earth, and the wicked shall [[#^note-33b|slay]] the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man; ^verse-33

**34**  And the [[#^note-34a|saints]] also shall [[#^note-34b|hardly]] [[#^note-34c|escape]]; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and will [[#^note-34d|come]] down in heaven from the presence of my Father and [[#^note-34e|consume]] the wicked with unquenchable fire. ^verse-34

**35**  And behold, this is not yet, but [[#^note-35a|by and by]]. ^verse-35

**36**  Wherefore, seeing that I, the Lord, have decreed all these things upon the face of the earth, I will that my saints should be assembled upon the land of Zion; ^verse-36

**37**  [[#^note-37a|And]] that every man should take [[#^note-37b|righteousness]] in his hands and [[#^note-37c|faithfulness]] upon his loins, and lift a warning [[#^note-37d|voice]] unto the inhabitants of the earth; and declare both by word and by flight that [[#^note-37e|desolation]] shall come upon the wicked. ^verse-37

**38**  Wherefore, let my disciples in Kirtland arrange their temporal concerns, who dwell upon this farm. ^verse-38

**39**  Let my servant Titus Billings, who has the care thereof, dispose of the land, that he may be prepared in the coming spring to take his journey up unto the land of Zion, with those that dwell upon the face thereof, excepting those whom I shall reserve unto myself, that shall [[#^note-39a|not go]] until I shall command them. ^verse-39

**40**  And let all the moneys which can be spared, it mattereth not unto me whether it be little or much, be sent up unto the land of Zion, unto them whom I have appointed to [[#^note-40a|receive]]. ^verse-40

**41**  Behold, I, the Lord, will give unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., power that he shall be enabled to [[#^note-41a|discern]] by the Spirit those who shall go up unto the land of Zion, and those of my disciples who shall tarry. ^verse-41

**42**  Let my servant [[#^note-42a|Newel K. Whitney]] retain his [[#^note-42b|store]], or in other words, the store, yet for a little season. ^verse-42

**43**  Nevertheless, let him impart all the money which he can impart, to be sent up unto the land of Zion. ^verse-43

**44**  Behold, these things are in his own hands, let him do [[#^note-44a|according]] to wisdom. ^verse-44

**45**  Verily I say, let him be [[#^note-45a|ordained]] as an agent unto the disciples that shall tarry, and let him be ordained unto this power; ^verse-45

**46**  And now speedily visit the churches, expounding these things unto them, with my servant Oliver Cowdery. Behold, this is my will, obtaining moneys even as I have directed. ^verse-46

**47**  He that is [[#^note-47a|faithful]] and [[#^note-47b|endureth]] shall overcome the world. ^verse-47

**48**  He that sendeth up treasures unto the land of Zion shall receive an [[#^note-48a|inheritance]] in this world, and his works shall follow him, and also a [[#^note-48b|reward]] in the world to come. ^verse-48

**49**  Yea, and blessed are the dead that [[#^note-49a|die]] in the Lord, from henceforth, when the Lord shall come, and old things shall [[#^note-49b|pass away]], and all things become new, they shall [[#^note-49c|rise]] from the dead and shall not [[#^note-49d|die]] after, and shall receive an inheritance before the Lord, in the [[#^note-49e|holy city]]. ^verse-49

**50**  And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and hath kept the faith, [[#^note-50a|blessed]] is he; nevertheless, it is appointed to him to [[#^note-50b|die]] at the age of man. ^verse-50

**51**  Wherefore, [[#^note-51a|children]] shall [[#^note-51b|grow up]] until they become old; old men shall die; but they shall not sleep in the dust, but they shall be [[#^note-51c|changed]] in the twinkling of an eye. ^verse-51

**52**  Wherefore, for this cause preached the apostles unto the world the resurrection of the dead. ^verse-52

**53**  These things are the things that ye must look for; and, speaking after the manner of the Lord, they are now [[#^note-53a|nigh]] at hand, and in a time to come, even in the day of the coming of the Son of Man. ^verse-53

**54**  And until that hour there will be foolish [[#^note-54a|virgins]] among the wise; and at that hour cometh an entire [[#^note-54b|separation]] of the righteous and the wicked; and in that day will I send mine angels to [[#^note-54c|pluck]] out the wicked and cast them into unquenchable fire. ^verse-54

**55**  And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with my servant [[#^note-55a|Sidney Rigdon]]; he [[#^note-55b|exalted]] himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but [[#^note-55c|grieved]] the Spirit; ^verse-55

**56**  Wherefore his [[#^note-56a|writing]] is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed him. ^verse-56

**57**  And again, verily I say unto you, [[#^note-57a|those]] who desire in their hearts, in meekness, to [[#^note-57b|warn]] sinners to repentance, let them be ordained unto this power. ^verse-57

**58**  For this is a day of [[#^note-58a|warning]], and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be [[#^note-58b|mocked]] in the last days. ^verse-58

**59**  Behold, I am from above, and my power lieth beneath. I am over all, and in all, and through all, and [[#^note-59a|search]] all things, and the day cometh that all things shall be [[#^note-59b|subject]] unto me. ^verse-59

**60**  Behold, I am [[#^note-60a|Alpha and Omega]], even Jesus Christ. ^verse-60

**61**  Wherefore, let all men [[#^note-61a|beware]] how they take my [[#^note-61b|name]] in their lips— ^verse-61

**62**  For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not [[#^note-62a|authority]]. ^verse-62

**63**  Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will [[#^note-63a|own]] them; otherwise they shall be cut off. ^verse-63

**64**  Remember that that which cometh from above is [[#^note-64a|sacred]], and must be [[#^note-64b|spoken]] with care, and by constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no condemnation, and ye receive the Spirit [[#^note-64c|through]] prayer; wherefore, without this there remaineth condemnation. ^verse-64

**65**  Let my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, seek them a home, as they are [[#^note-65a|taught]] through prayer by the Spirit. ^verse-65

**66**  These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal [[#^note-66a|weight]] of [[#^note-66b|glory]], otherwise, a greater condemnation. Amen. ^verse-66
