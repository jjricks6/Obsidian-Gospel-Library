*1-5, Many false spirits are abroad in the earth; 6-9, Wo unto the hypocrites and those who are cut off from the Church; 10-14, Elders are to preach the gospel by the Spirit; 15-22, Both preachers and hearers need to be enlightened by the Spirit; 23-25, That which doth not edify is not of God; 26-28, The faithful are possessors of all things; 29-36, The prayers of the purified are answered; 37-46, Christ is the Good Shepherd and the Stone of Israel.*

**1**  Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to the [[#^note-1a|voice]] of the living God; and attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you, according as ye have asked and are agreed as touching the church, and the [[#^note-1b|spirits]] which have gone abroad in the earth. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many [[#^note-2a|spirits]] which are false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world. ^verse-2

**3**  And also [[#^note-3a|Satan]] hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you. ^verse-3

**4**  Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and have seen [[#^note-4a|abominations]] in the church that [[#^note-4b|profess]] my name. ^verse-4

**5**  But blessed are they who are faithful and [[#^note-5a|endure]], whether in life or in death, for they shall inherit eternal life. ^verse-5

**6**  But wo unto them that are [[#^note-6a|deceivers]] and hypocrites, for, thus saith the Lord, I will bring them to judgment. ^verse-6

**7**  Behold, verily I say unto you, there are [[#^note-7a|hypocrites]] among you, who have deceived some, which has given the [[#^note-7b|adversary]] [[#^note-7c|power]]; but behold [[#^note-7d|such]] shall be reclaimed; ^verse-7

**8**  But the [[#^note-8a|hypocrites]] shall be detected and shall be [[#^note-8b|cut off]], either in life or in death, even as I will; and wo unto them who are cut off from my church, for the same are overcome of the world. ^verse-8

**9**  Wherefore, let every man beware lest he do that which is not in truth and righteousness before me. ^verse-9

**10**  And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us [[#^note-10a|reason]] together, that ye may understand; ^verse-10

**11**  Let us reason even as a man reasoneth one with another face to face. ^verse-11

**12**  Now, when a man reasoneth he is understood of man, because he reasoneth as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may [[#^note-12a|understand]]. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question—unto what were ye [[#^note-13a|ordained]]? ^verse-13

**14**  To preach my gospel by the [[#^note-14a|Spirit]], even the [[#^note-14b|Comforter]] which was sent forth to teach the truth. ^verse-14

**15**  And then received ye [[#^note-15a|spirits]] which ye could not understand, and received them to be of God; and in this are ye justified? ^verse-15

**16**  Behold ye shall answer this question yourselves; nevertheless, I will be [[#^note-16a|merciful]] unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter shall be made [[#^note-16b|strong]]. ^verse-16

**17**  Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to [[#^note-17a|preach]] the word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he [[#^note-17b|preach]] it by the Spirit of truth or some other way? ^verse-17

**18**  And if it be by some other way it is not of God. ^verse-18

**19**  And again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the Spirit of truth or some other way? ^verse-19

**20**  If it be some other way it is not of God. ^verse-20

**21**  Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that receiveth the word by the [[#^note-21a|Spirit of truth]] receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth? ^verse-21

**22**  Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are [[#^note-22a|edified]] and [[#^note-22b|rejoice]] together. ^verse-22

**23**  And that which doth not [[#^note-23a|edify]] is not of God, and is [[#^note-23b|darkness]]. ^verse-23

**24**  That which is of God is [[#^note-24a|light]]; and he that [[#^note-24b|receiveth]] [[#^note-24c|light]], and [[#^note-24d|continueth]] in God, receiveth more [[#^note-24e|light]]; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. ^verse-24

**25**  And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the [[#^note-25a|truth]], that you may chase darkness from among you; ^verse-25

**26**  He that is [[#^note-26a|ordained]] of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be the [[#^note-26b|greatest]], notwithstanding he is the [[#^note-26c|least]] and the [[#^note-26d|servant]] of all. ^verse-26

**27**  Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for all things are [[#^note-27a|subject]] unto him, both in heaven and on the earth, the life and the light, the Spirit and the [[#^note-27b|power]], sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son. ^verse-27

**28**  But no man is possessor of [[#^note-28a|all]] things except he be [[#^note-28b|purified]] and [[#^note-28c|cleansed]] from all sin. ^verse-28

**29**  And if ye are [[#^note-29a|purified]] and cleansed from all [[#^note-29b|sin]], ye shall [[#^note-29c|ask]] whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done. ^verse-29

**30**  But know this, it shall be given you what you shall [[#^note-30a|ask]]; and as ye are appointed to the [[#^note-30b|head]], the spirits shall be subject unto you. ^verse-30

**31**  Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a [[#^note-31a|spirit]] manifested that you cannot understand, and you receive not that spirit, ye shall ask of the Father in the name of Jesus; and if he give not unto you that spirit, then you may know that it is not of God. ^verse-31

**32**  And it shall be given unto you, [[#^note-32a|power]] over that spirit; and you shall proclaim against that spirit with a loud voice that it is [[#^note-32b|not of God]]— ^verse-32

**33**  Not with [[#^note-33a|railing]] accusation, that ye be not overcome, neither with [[#^note-33b|boasting]] nor rejoicing, lest you be seized therewith. ^verse-33

**34**  He that receiveth of God, let him [[#^note-34a|account]] it of God; and let him rejoice that he is accounted of God worthy to receive. ^verse-34

**35**  And by giving heed and doing these things which ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive—and the [[#^note-35a|kingdom]] is given [[#^note-35b|you]] of the Father, and [[#^note-35c|power]] to [[#^note-35d|overcome]] all things which are not ordained of him— ^verse-35

**36**  And behold, verily I say unto you, blessed are you who are now hearing these words of mine from the mouth of my servant, for your sins are [[#^note-36a|forgiven]] you. ^verse-36

**37**  Let my servant Joseph Wakefield, in whom I am well pleased, and my servant [[#^note-37a|Parley P. Pratt]] go forth among the churches and strengthen them by the word of [[#^note-37b|exhortation]]; ^verse-37

**38**  And also my servant John Corrill, or as many of my servants as are ordained unto this office, and let them labor in the [[#^note-38a|vineyard]]; and let no man hinder them doing that which I have appointed unto them— ^verse-38

**39**  Wherefore, in this thing my servant [[#^note-39a|Edward Partridge]] is not justified; nevertheless let him repent and he shall be forgiven. ^verse-39

**40**  Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot [[#^note-40a|bear]] all things now; ye must [[#^note-40b|grow]] in [[#^note-40c|grace]] and in the knowledge of the truth. ^verse-40

**41**  [[#^note-41a|Fear not]], little [[#^note-41b|children]], for you are mine, and I have [[#^note-41c|overcome]] the world, and you are of them that my Father hath [[#^note-41d|given]] me; ^verse-41

**42**  And none of them that my Father hath given me shall be [[#^note-42a|lost]]. ^verse-42

**43**  And the Father and I are [[#^note-43a|one]]. I am [[#^note-43b|in]] the Father and the Father in me; and inasmuch as ye have received me, ye are in me and I in you. ^verse-43

**44**  Wherefore, I am in your midst, and I am the [[#^note-44a|good]] [[#^note-44b|shepherd]], and the [[#^note-44c|stone]] of Israel. He that buildeth upon this [[#^note-44d|rock]] shall never [[#^note-44e|fall]]. ^verse-44

**45**  And the [[#^note-45a|day]] cometh that you shall hear my voice and [[#^note-45b|see]] me, and [[#^note-45c|know]] that I am. ^verse-45

**46**  [[#^note-46a|Watch]], therefore, that ye may be [[#^note-46b|ready]]. Even so. Amen. ^verse-46
