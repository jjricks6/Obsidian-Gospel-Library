*1-5, Inheritances in Zion are to be received through consecration; 6-12, One mighty and strong will give the Saints their inheritance in Zion.*

**1**  It is the duty of the Lord's clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a [[#^note-1a|history]], and a general church [[#^note-1b|record]] of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who [[#^note-1c|consecrate]] properties, and receive [[#^note-1d|inheritances]] legally from the bishop; ^verse-1

**2**  And also their manner of life, their faith, and works; and also of the [[#^note-2a|apostates]] who apostatize after receiving their inheritances. ^verse-2

**3**  It is contrary to the will and commandment of God that those who receive not their [[#^note-3a|inheritance]] by [[#^note-3b|consecration]], agreeable to his [[#^note-3c|law]], which he has given, that he may [[#^note-3d|tithe]] his people, to prepare them against the day of [[#^note-3e|vengeance]] and burning, should have their [[#^note-3f|names]] enrolled with the people of God. ^verse-3

**4**  Neither is their [[#^note-4a|genealogy]] to be kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or history of the church. ^verse-4

**5**  Their names shall not be found, neither the names of the fathers, nor the names of the children written in the [[#^note-5a|book]] of the law of God, saith the Lord of Hosts. ^verse-5

**6**  Yea, thus saith the [[#^note-6a|still small voice]], which whispereth through and [[#^note-6b|pierceth]] all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest, saying: ^verse-6

**7**  And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in [[#^note-7a|order]] the house of God, and to arrange by [[#^note-7b|lot]] the [[#^note-7c|inheritances]] of the saints whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God; ^verse-7

**8**  While that man, who was called of God and appointed, that putteth forth his hand to [[#^note-8a|steady]] the [[#^note-8b|ark]] of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning. ^verse-8

**9**  And all they who are not found written in the [[#^note-9a|book of remembrance]] shall find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their portion shall be appointed them among [[#^note-9b|unbelievers]], where are [[#^note-9c|wailing]] and gnashing of teeth. ^verse-9

**10**  These things I say not of [[#^note-10a|myself]]; therefore, as the Lord speaketh, he will also fulfil. ^verse-10

**11**  And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose names are not found written in the [[#^note-11a|book]] of the law, or that are found to have [[#^note-11b|apostatized]], or to have been [[#^note-11c|cut off]] from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall [[#^note-11d|not]] find an inheritance among the saints of the Most High; ^verse-11

**12**  Therefore, it shall be done unto them as unto the [[#^note-12a|children]] of the [[#^note-12b|priest]], as will be found recorded in the second chapter and sixty-first and second verses of Ezra. ^verse-12
