**1**  [[#^note-1a|Hear]], O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is [[#^note-1b|God]], and beside him there is [[#^note-1c|no]] [[#^note-1d|Savior]]. ^verse-1

**2**  [[#^note-2a|Great]] is his wisdom, [[#^note-2b|marvelous]] are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out. ^verse-2

**3**  His [[#^note-3a|purposes]] fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand. ^verse-3

**4**  From eternity to eternity he is the [[#^note-4a|same]], and his years never [[#^note-4b|fail]]. ^verse-4

**5**  For thus saith the Lord—I, the Lord, am [[#^note-5a|merciful]] and gracious unto those who [[#^note-5b|fear]] me, and delight to honor those who [[#^note-5c|serve]] me in righteousness and in truth unto the end. ^verse-5

**6**  Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their [[#^note-6a|glory]]. ^verse-6

**7**  And to them will I [[#^note-7a|reveal]] all [[#^note-7b|mysteries]], yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom. ^verse-7

**8**  Yea, even the wonders of [[#^note-8a|eternity]] shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations. ^verse-8

**9**  And their [[#^note-9a|wisdom]] shall be great, and their [[#^note-9b|understanding]] reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall [[#^note-9c|perish]], and the understanding of the [[#^note-9d|prudent]] shall come to naught. ^verse-9

**10**  For by my [[#^note-10a|Spirit]] will I [[#^note-10b|enlighten]] them, and by my [[#^note-10c|power]] will I make known unto them the [[#^note-10d|secrets]] of my [[#^note-10e|will]]—yea, even those things which [[#^note-10f|eye]] has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man. ^verse-10

**11**  We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, be[[#^note-11a|in]]g in the Spirit on the sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two— ^verse-11

**12**  By the power of the [[#^note-12a|Spirit]] our [[#^note-12b|eyes]] were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God— ^verse-12

**13**  Even those things which were from the [[#^note-13a|beginning]] before the world was, which were ordained of the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, even from the beginning; ^verse-13

**14**  Of whom we bear record; and the record which we bear is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and with whom we [[#^note-14a|conversed]] in the heavenly [[#^note-14b|vision]]. ^verse-14

**15**  For while we were doing the work of [[#^note-15a|translation]], which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows— ^verse-15

**16**  Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall [[#^note-16a|hear]] the voice of the [[#^note-16b|Son of Man]]: ^verse-16

**17**  And shall come forth; [[#^note-17a|they]] who have done [[#^note-17b|good]], in the [[#^note-17c|resurrection]] of the [[#^note-17d|just]]; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust. ^verse-17

**18**  Now this caused us to marvel, for it was given unto us of the Spirit. ^verse-18

**19**  And while we [[#^note-19a|meditated]] upon these things, the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the [[#^note-19b|glory]] of the Lord shone round about. ^verse-19

**20**  And we beheld the [[#^note-20a|glory]] of the Son, on the [[#^note-20b|right hand]] of the [[#^note-20c|Father]], and received of his fulness; ^verse-20

**21**  And saw the holy [[#^note-21a|angels]], and them who are [[#^note-21b|sanctified]] before his throne, [[#^note-21c|worship]]ing God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever. ^verse-21

**22**  And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the [[#^note-22a|testimony]], last of all, which we give of him: That he [[#^note-22b|lives]]! ^verse-22

**23**  For we [[#^note-23a|saw]] him, even on the [[#^note-23b|right hand]] of [[#^note-23c|God]]; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the [[#^note-23d|Only Begotten]] of the Father— ^verse-23

**24**  That by [[#^note-24a|him]], and through him, and of him, the [[#^note-24b|worlds]] are and were created, and the [[#^note-24c|inhabitants]] thereof are begotten [[#^note-24d|sons]] and daughters unto God. ^verse-24

**25**  And this we saw also, and bear record, that an [[#^note-25a|angel]] of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who [[#^note-25b|rebelled]] against the Only Begotten [[#^note-25c|Son]] whom the Father [[#^note-25d|loved]] and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, ^verse-25

**26**  And was called [[#^note-26a|Perdition]], for the heavens [[#^note-26b|wept]] over him—he was [[#^note-26c|Lucifer]], a son of the morning. ^verse-26

**27**  And we beheld, and lo, he is [[#^note-27a|fallen]]! is fallen, even a son of the morning! ^verse-27

**28**  And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old [[#^note-28a|serpent]], even the [[#^note-28b|devil]], who rebelled against [[#^note-28c|God]], and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ— ^verse-28

**29**  Wherefore, he maketh [[#^note-29a|war]] with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about. ^verse-29

**30**  And we saw a vision of the [[#^note-30a|sufferings]] of those with whom he made war and overcame, for thus came the voice of the Lord unto us: ^verse-30

**31**  Thus saith the Lord concerning all those who know my power, and have been made partakers thereof, and [[#^note-31a|suffered]] themselves through the power of the devil to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my power— ^verse-31

**32**  They are they who are the [[#^note-32a|sons]] of [[#^note-32b|perdition]], of whom I say that it had been better for them never to have been born; ^verse-32

**33**  For they are [[#^note-33a|vessels]] of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels in eternity; ^verse-33

**34**  Concerning whom I have said there is [[#^note-34a|no]] [[#^note-34b|forgiveness]] in this world nor in the world to come— ^verse-34

**35**  Having [[#^note-35a|denied]] the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father, having [[#^note-35b|crucified]] him unto themselves and put him to an open [[#^note-35c|shame]]. ^verse-35

**36**  These are they who shall go away into the [[#^note-36a|lake]] of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels— ^verse-36

**37**  And the [[#^note-37a|only]] ones on whom the [[#^note-37b|second]] [[#^note-37c|death]] shall have any power; ^verse-37

**38**  Yea, verily, the only ones who shall [[#^note-38a|not be redeemed]] in the due time of the Lord, after the sufferings of his wrath. ^verse-38

**39**  For all the rest shall be [[#^note-39a|brought forth]] by the resurrection of the dead, through the [[#^note-39b|triumph]] and the glory of the Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father [[#^note-39c|before]] the worlds were made. ^verse-39

**40**  And this is the [[#^note-40a|gospel]], the glad [[#^note-40b|tidings]], which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us— ^verse-40

**41**  That he [[#^note-41a|came]] into the world, even Jesus, to be [[#^note-41b|crucified]] for the world, and to [[#^note-41c|bear]] the sins of the [[#^note-41d|world]], and to [[#^note-41e|sanctify]] the world, and to [[#^note-41f|cleanse]] it from all unrighteousness; ^verse-41

**42**  That through him all might be [[#^note-42a|saved]] whom the Father had put into his [[#^note-42b|power]] and made by him; ^verse-42

**43**  Who [[#^note-43a|glorifies]] the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those sons of [[#^note-43b|perdition]] who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him. ^verse-43

**44**  Wherefore, he saves all [[#^note-44a|except]] them—they shall go away into [[#^note-44b|everlasting]] [[#^note-44c|punishment]], which is endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to [[#^note-44d|reign]] with the [[#^note-44e|devil]] and his angels in eternity, where their [[#^note-44f|worm]] dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is their torment— ^verse-44

**45**  And the [[#^note-45a|end]] thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; ^verse-45

**46**  Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof; ^verse-46

**47**  Nevertheless, I, the Lord, show it by [[#^note-47a|vision]] unto many, but straightway shut it up again; ^verse-47

**48**  Wherefore, the end, the width, the height, the [[#^note-48a|depth]], and the misery thereof, they understand not, neither any man except those who are [[#^note-48b|ordained]] unto this [[#^note-48c|condemnation]]. ^verse-48

**49**  And we heard the voice, saying: [[#^note-49a|Write]] the vision, for lo, this is the end of the vision of the sufferings of the ungodly. ^verse-49

**50**  And again we bear record—for we [[#^note-50a|saw]] and heard, and this is the [[#^note-50b|testimony]] of the [[#^note-50c|gospel]] of Christ concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection of the [[#^note-50d|just]]— ^verse-50

**51**  They are they who received the [[#^note-51a|testimony]] of Jesus, and [[#^note-51b|believed]] on his name and were [[#^note-51c|baptized]] after the [[#^note-51d|manner]] of his burial, being [[#^note-51e|buried]] in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has given— ^verse-51

**52**  That by [[#^note-52a|keeping]] the commandments they might be [[#^note-52b|washed]] and [[#^note-52c|cleansed]] from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the [[#^note-52d|hands]] of him who is [[#^note-52e|ordained]] and sealed unto this power; ^verse-52

**53**  And who [[#^note-53a|overcome]] by faith, and are [[#^note-53b|sealed]] by the Holy Spirit of [[#^note-53c|promise]], which the Father [[#^note-53d|sheds]] forth upon all those who are just and true. ^verse-53

**54**  They are they who are the [[#^note-54a|church]] of the [[#^note-54b|Firstborn]]. ^verse-54

**55**  They are they into whose hands the Father has given [[#^note-55a|all]] things— ^verse-55

**56**  They are they who are [[#^note-56a|priests]] and [[#^note-56b|kings]], who have received of his fulness, and of his glory; ^verse-56

**57**  And are [[#^note-57a|priests]] of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of [[#^note-57b|Enoch]], which was after the [[#^note-57c|order]] of the Only Begotten Son. ^verse-57

**58**  Wherefore, as it is written, they are [[#^note-58a|gods]], even the [[#^note-58b|sons]] of [[#^note-58c|God]]— ^verse-58

**59**  Wherefore, [[#^note-59a|all]] things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's. ^verse-59

**60**  And they shall [[#^note-60a|overcome]] all things. ^verse-60

**61**  Wherefore, let no man [[#^note-61a|glory]] in man, but rather let him [[#^note-61b|glory]] in God, who shall [[#^note-61c|subdue]] all enemies under his feet. ^verse-61

**62**  These shall [[#^note-62a|dwell]] in the [[#^note-62b|presence]] of God and his Christ forever and ever. ^verse-62

**63**  These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall [[#^note-63a|come]] in the [[#^note-63b|clouds]] of heaven to [[#^note-63c|reign]] on the earth over his people. ^verse-63

**64**  These are they who shall have part in the [[#^note-64a|first resurrection]]. ^verse-64

**65**  These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the [[#^note-65a|just]]. ^verse-65

**66**  These are they who are come unto [[#^note-66a|Mount]] [[#^note-66b|Zion]], and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all. ^verse-66

**67**  These are they who have come to an innumerable company of [[#^note-67a|angels]], to the general assembly and church of [[#^note-67b|Enoch]], and of the [[#^note-67c|Firstborn]]. ^verse-67

**68**  These are they whose names are [[#^note-68a|written]] in heaven, where God and Christ are the [[#^note-68b|judge]] of all. ^verse-68

**69**  These are they who are [[#^note-69a|just]] men made [[#^note-69b|perfect]] through Jesus the mediator of the [[#^note-69c|new covenant]], who wrought out this perfect [[#^note-69d|atonement]] through the shedding of his own [[#^note-69e|blood]]. ^verse-69

**70**  These are they whose bodies are [[#^note-70a|celestial]], whose [[#^note-70b|glory]] is that of the [[#^note-70c|sun]], even the glory of God, the [[#^note-70d|highest]] of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical. ^verse-70

**71**  And again, we saw the [[#^note-71a|terrestrial]] world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the [[#^note-71b|Firstborn]] who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the [[#^note-71c|moon]] differs from the sun in the firmament. ^verse-71

**72**  Behold, these are they who died [[#^note-72a|without]] [[#^note-72b|law]]; ^verse-72

**73**  And also they who are the [[#^note-73a|spirits]] of men kept in [[#^note-73b|prison]], whom the Son visited, and [[#^note-73c|preached]] the [[#^note-73d|gospel]] unto them, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh; ^verse-73

**74**  Who [[#^note-74a|received not]] the [[#^note-74b|testimony]] of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it. ^verse-74

**75**  These are they who are [[#^note-75a|honorable]] men of the earth, who were [[#^note-75b|blinded]] by the craftiness of men. ^verse-75

**76**  These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness. ^verse-76

**77**  These are they who receive of the [[#^note-77a|presence]] of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father. ^verse-77

**78**  Wherefore, they are [[#^note-78a|bodies terrestrial]], and not bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon differs from the sun. ^verse-78

**79**  These are they who are not [[#^note-79a|valiant]] in the [[#^note-79b|testimony]] of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God. ^verse-79

**80**  And now this is the end of the [[#^note-80a|vision]] which we saw of the terrestrial, that the Lord commanded us to [[#^note-80b|write]] while we were yet in the Spirit. ^verse-80

**81**  And again, we [[#^note-81a|saw]] the glory of the [[#^note-81b|telestial]], which [[#^note-81c|glory]] is that of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs from that of the glory of the moon in the firmament. ^verse-81

**82**  These are they who received not the gospel of Christ, neither the [[#^note-82a|testimony]] of Jesus. ^verse-82

**83**  These are they who [[#^note-83a|deny]] not the Holy Spirit. ^verse-83

**84**  These are they who are thrust down to [[#^note-84a|hell]]. ^verse-84

**85**  These are they who shall not be redeemed from the [[#^note-85a|devil]] until the [[#^note-85b|last resurrection]], until the Lord, even Christ the [[#^note-85c|Lamb]], shall have finished his work. ^verse-85

**86**  These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial; ^verse-86

**87**  And the terrestrial through the [[#^note-87a|ministration]] of the celestial. ^verse-87

**88**  And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to minister for them, or who are appointed to be [[#^note-88a|ministering spirits]] for them; for they shall be [[#^note-88b|heirs]] of salvation. ^verse-88

**89**  And thus we saw, in the heavenly vision, the glory of the [[#^note-89a|telestial]], which surpasses all understanding; ^verse-89

**90**  And no man knows it except him to whom God has revealed it. ^verse-90

**91**  And thus we saw the glory of the [[#^note-91a|terrestrial]] which excels in all things the glory of the telestial, even in glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion. ^verse-91

**92**  And thus we saw the [[#^note-92a|glory]] of the celestial, which [[#^note-92b|excels]] in all things—where God, even the Father, reigns upon his [[#^note-92c|throne]] forever and ever; ^verse-92

**93**  Before whose throne all things bow in humble [[#^note-93a|reverence]], and give him glory forever and ever. ^verse-93

**94**  They who dwell in his [[#^note-94a|presence]] are the church of the [[#^note-94b|Firstborn]]; and they see as they are seen, and [[#^note-94c|know]] as they are known, having received of his fulness and of his [[#^note-94d|grace]]; ^verse-94

**95**  And he makes them [[#^note-95a|equal]] in power, and in might, and in dominion. ^verse-95

**96**  And the glory of the celestial is one, even as the glory of the [[#^note-96a|sun]] is one. ^verse-96

**97**  And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even as the glory of the moon is one. ^verse-97

**98**  And the glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is one; for as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in glory in the telestial world; ^verse-98

**99**  For these are they who are of [[#^note-99a|Paul]], and of Apollos, and of Cephas. ^verse-99

**100**  These are they who say they are some of one and some of another—some of Christ and some of John, and some of Moses, and some of Elias, and some of [[#^note-100a|Esaias]], and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch; ^verse-100

**101**  But [[#^note-101a|received not]] the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the [[#^note-101b|everlasting covenant]]. ^verse-101

**102**  Last of all, these all are they who will not be [[#^note-102a|gathered]] with the saints, to be [[#^note-102b|caught up]] unto the [[#^note-102c|church]] of the Firstborn, and received into the cloud. ^verse-102

**103**  These are [[#^note-103a|they]] who are [[#^note-103b|liars]], and [[#^note-103c|sorcerers]], and [[#^note-103d|adulterers]], and [[#^note-103e|whoremongers]], and whosoever loves and makes a lie. ^verse-103

**104**  These are they who suffer the [[#^note-104a|wrath]] of God on earth. ^verse-104

**105**  These are they who suffer the [[#^note-105a|vengeance]] of eternal fire. ^verse-105

**106**  These are they who are cast down to [[#^note-106a|hell]] and [[#^note-106b|suffer]] the wrath of [[#^note-106c|Almighty God]], until the [[#^note-106d|fulness]] of times, when Christ shall have [[#^note-106e|subdued]] all enemies under his [[#^note-106f|feet]], and shall have [[#^note-106g|perfected]] his work; ^verse-106

**107**  When he shall [[#^note-107a|deliver]] up the [[#^note-107b|kingdom]], and present it unto the Father, spotless, saying: I have [[#^note-107c|overcome]] and have [[#^note-107d|trodden]] the [[#^note-107e|wine-press]] [[#^note-107f|alone]], even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. ^verse-107

**108**  Then shall he be [[#^note-108a|crowned]] with the crown of his glory, to sit on the [[#^note-108b|throne]] of his power to reign forever and ever. ^verse-108

**109**  But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as [[#^note-109a|innumerable]] as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore; ^verse-109

**110**  And heard the voice of the Lord saying: These all shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall [[#^note-110a|confess]] to him who sits upon the throne forever and ever; ^verse-110

**111**  For they shall be judged according to their [[#^note-111a|works]], and every man shall receive according to his own [[#^note-111b|works]], his own [[#^note-111c|dominion]], in the [[#^note-111d|mansions]] which are prepared; ^verse-111

**112**  And they shall be [[#^note-112a|servants]] of the Most High; but [[#^note-112b|where]] God and Christ [[#^note-112c|dwell]] they [[#^note-112d|cannot]] come, [[#^note-112e|worlds]] without end. ^verse-112

**113**  This is the end of the vision which we saw, which we were commanded to write while we were yet in the Spirit. ^verse-113

**114**  But [[#^note-114a|great]] and marvelous are the works of the Lord, and the [[#^note-114b|mysteries]] of his kingdom which he showed unto us, which surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in dominion; ^verse-114

**115**  Which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet in the Spirit, and are not [[#^note-115a|lawful]] for man to utter; ^verse-115

**116**  Neither is man [[#^note-116a|capable]] to make them known, for they are only to be [[#^note-116b|seen]] and [[#^note-116c|understood]] by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who [[#^note-116d|love]] him, and purify themselves before him; ^verse-116

**117**  To whom he grants this privilege of [[#^note-117a|seeing]] and knowing for themselves; ^verse-117

**118**  That through the power and manifestation of the Spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to [[#^note-118a|bear]] his [[#^note-118b|presence]] in the world of glory. ^verse-118

**119**  And to God and the Lamb be [[#^note-119a|glory]], and honor, and dominion forever and ever. Amen. ^verse-119
