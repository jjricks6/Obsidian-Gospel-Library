*1-4, Laborers are called to declare the gospel in the eleventh hour; 5-6, The Church is established, and the elect are to be gathered; 7-10, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; 11-15, The Church is built upon the gospel rock; 16-18, Prepare for the coming of the Bridegroom.*

**1**  Behold, I say unto you, my servants [[#^note-1a|Ezra]] and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose [[#^note-1b|word]] is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and [[#^note-1c|intents]] of the heart. ^verse-1

**2**  For verily, verily, I say unto you that ye are called to lift up your voices as with the [[#^note-2a|sound]] of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and [[#^note-2b|perverse]] generation. ^verse-2

**3**  For behold, the [[#^note-3a|field]] is [[#^note-3b|white]] already to harvest; and it is the [[#^note-3c|eleventh]] hour, and the last time that I shall call [[#^note-3d|laborers]] into my vineyard. ^verse-3

**4**  And my [[#^note-4a|vineyard]] has become [[#^note-4b|corrupted]] every whit; and there is none which doeth [[#^note-4c|good]] save it be a few; and they [[#^note-4d|err]] in many instances because of [[#^note-4e|priestcrafts]], all having corrupt minds. ^verse-4

**5**  And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this [[#^note-5a|church]] have I [[#^note-5b|established]] and called forth out of the [[#^note-5c|wilderness]]. ^verse-5

**6**  And even so will I [[#^note-6a|gather]] mine elect from the [[#^note-6b|four]] quarters of the earth, even as many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice. ^verse-6

**7**  Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the field is [[#^note-7a|white]] already to harvest; wherefore, thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your might, mind, and strength. ^verse-7

**8**  [[#^note-8a|Open]] your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as [[#^note-8b|Nephi]] of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness. ^verse-8

**9**  Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with [[#^note-9a|sheaves]] upon your backs, for lo, I am with you. ^verse-9

**10**  Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: [[#^note-10a|Repent]], repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the [[#^note-10b|kingdom]] of heaven is at hand; ^verse-10

**11**  Yea, [[#^note-11a|repent]] and be baptized, every one of you, for a [[#^note-11b|remission]] of your sins; yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost. ^verse-11

**12**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my [[#^note-12a|gospel]]; and remember that they shall have faith in me or they can in nowise be saved; ^verse-12

**13**  And upon this [[#^note-13a|rock]] I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the [[#^note-13b|gates]] of hell shall not prevail against you. ^verse-13

**14**  And ye shall remember the church [[#^note-14a|articles and covenants]] to keep them. ^verse-14

**15**  And whoso having faith you shall [[#^note-15a|confirm]] in my church, by the laying on of the [[#^note-15b|hands]], and I will bestow the [[#^note-15c|gift]] of the Holy Ghost upon them. ^verse-15

**16**  And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your [[#^note-16a|instruction]]; and the power of my [[#^note-16b|Spirit]] [[#^note-16c|quickeneth]] all things. ^verse-16

**17**    Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your [[#^note-17a|lamps]] [[#^note-17b|trimmed]] and burning, and oil with you, that you may be [[#^note-17c|ready]] at the coming of the [[#^note-17d|Bridegroom]]â€” ^verse-17

**18**  For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that I [[#^note-18a|come]] quickly. Even so. Amen. ^verse-18
