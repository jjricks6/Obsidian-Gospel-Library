*1-5, Scriptures show how to build up the Church; 6-8, The world is ripening in iniquity; 9-16, The worth of souls is great; 17-25, To gain salvation, men must take upon themselves the name of Christ; 26-36, The calling and mission of the Twelve are revealed; 37-39, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer are to search out the Twelve; 40-47, To gain salvation, men must repent, be baptized, and keep the commandments.*

**1**  Now, behold, because of the thing which you, my servant Oliver Cowdery, have desired to know of me, I give unto you these words: ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I have [[#^note-2a|manifested]] unto you, by my Spirit in many instances, that the [[#^note-2b|things]] which you have written are [[#^note-2c|true]]; wherefore you know that they are true. ^verse-2

**3**  And if you know that they are true, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that you [[#^note-3a|rely]] upon the things which are [[#^note-3b|written]]; ^verse-3

**4**  For in them are all things [[#^note-4a|written]] concerning the foundation of my church, my gospel, and my [[#^note-4b|rock]]. ^verse-4

**5**  Wherefore, if you shall build up my [[#^note-5a|church]], upon the foundation of my gospel and my [[#^note-5b|rock]], the [[#^note-5c|gates]] of hell shall not prevail against you. ^verse-5

**6**  Behold, the [[#^note-6a|world]] is [[#^note-6b|ripening]] in iniquity; and it must needs be that the children of men are stirred up unto repentance, both the [[#^note-6c|Gentiles]] and also the house of Israel. ^verse-6

**7**  Wherefore, as thou hast been [[#^note-7a|baptized]] by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., according to that which I have commanded him, he hath fulfilled the thing which I commanded him. ^verse-7

**8**  And now, marvel not that I have [[#^note-8a|called]] him unto mine own purpose, which purpose is known in me; wherefore, if he shall be [[#^note-8b|diligent]] in keeping my commandments he shall be [[#^note-8c|blessed]] unto eternal life; and his name is [[#^note-8d|Joseph]]. ^verse-8

**9**  And now, Oliver Cowdery, I speak unto you, and also unto David Whitmer, by the way of [[#^note-9a|command]]ment; for, behold, I command all men everywhere to repent, and I speak unto you, even as unto Paul mine [[#^note-9b|apostle]], for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called. ^verse-9

**10**  Remember the [[#^note-10a|worth]] of [[#^note-10b|souls]] is great in the sight of God; ^verse-10

**11**  For, behold, the Lord your [[#^note-11a|Redeemer]] suffered [[#^note-11b|death]] in the flesh; wherefore he [[#^note-11c|suffered]] the [[#^note-11d|pain]] of all men, that all men might repent and [[#^note-11e|come]] unto him. ^verse-11

**12**  And he hath [[#^note-12a|risen]] again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of [[#^note-12b|repentance]]. ^verse-12

**13**  And how great is his [[#^note-13a|joy]] in the [[#^note-13b|soul]] that [[#^note-13c|repenteth]]! ^verse-13

**14**  Wherefore, you are called to [[#^note-14a|cry]] repentance unto this people. ^verse-14

**15**  And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one [[#^note-15a|soul]] unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! ^verse-15

**16**  And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the [[#^note-16a|kingdom]] of my Father, how great will be your [[#^note-16b|joy]] if you should bring many [[#^note-16c|souls]] unto me! ^verse-16

**17**  Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my [[#^note-17a|salvation]]. ^verse-17

**18**  [[#^note-18a|Ask]] the Father in my [[#^note-18b|name]] in faith, believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are [[#^note-18c|expedient]] unto the children of men. ^verse-18

**19**  And if you have not [[#^note-19a|faith]], [[#^note-19b|hope]], and [[#^note-19c|charity]], you can do nothing. ^verse-19

**20**  [[#^note-20a|Contend]] against no church, save it be the [[#^note-20b|church of the devil]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Take upon you the [[#^note-21a|name]] of Christ, and [[#^note-21b|speak]] the truth in [[#^note-21c|soberness]]. ^verse-21

**22**  And as many as repent and are [[#^note-22a|baptized]] in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and [[#^note-22b|endure]] to the end, the same shall be saved. ^verse-22

**23**  Behold, Jesus Christ is the [[#^note-23a|name]] which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be [[#^note-23b|saved]]; ^verse-23

**24**  Wherefore, all men must take upon them the [[#^note-24a|name]] which is given of the Father, for in that name shall they be called at the last day; ^verse-24

**25**  Wherefore, if they [[#^note-25a|know not]] the [[#^note-25b|name]] by which they are called, they cannot have place in the [[#^note-25c|kingdom]] of my Father. ^verse-25

**26**  And now, behold, there are others who are [[#^note-26a|called]] to declare my gospel, both unto [[#^note-26b|Gentile]] and unto Jew; ^verse-26

**27**  Yea, even twelve; and the [[#^note-27a|Twelve]] shall be my disciples, and they shall take upon them my [[#^note-27b|name]]; and the Twelve are they who shall desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart. ^verse-27

**28**  And if they desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart, they are called to go into all the [[#^note-28a|world]] to preach my [[#^note-28b|gospel]] unto [[#^note-28c|every creature]]. ^verse-28

**29**  And they are they who are ordained of me to [[#^note-29a|baptize]] in my name, according to that which is written; ^verse-29

**30**  And you have that which is written before you; wherefore, you must perform it [[#^note-30a|according]] to the words which are [[#^note-30b|written]]. ^verse-30

**31**  And now I speak unto you, the [[#^note-31a|Twelve]]â€”Behold, my grace is sufficient for you; you must walk uprightly before me and sin not. ^verse-31

**32**  And, behold, you are they who are [[#^note-32a|ordain]]ed of me to ordain priests and teachers; to declare my gospel, [[#^note-32b|according]] to the power of the Holy Ghost which is in you, and according to the [[#^note-32c|callings]] and gifts of God unto men; ^verse-32

**33**  And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it. ^verse-33

**34**  These [[#^note-34a|words]] are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man; ^verse-34

**35**  For it is my [[#^note-35a|voice]] which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them; ^verse-35

**36**  Wherefore, you can [[#^note-36a|testify]] that you have [[#^note-36b|heard]] my voice, and know my words. ^verse-36

**37**  And now, behold, I give unto you, Oliver Cowdery, and also unto David Whitmer, that you shall search out the Twelve, who shall have the desires of which I have spoken; ^verse-37

**38**  And by their [[#^note-38a|desires]] and their [[#^note-38b|works]] you shall know them. ^verse-38

**39**  And when you have found them you shall show these things unto them. ^verse-39

**40**  And you shall fall down and [[#^note-40a|worship]] the Father in my [[#^note-40b|name]]. ^verse-40

**41**  And you must preach unto the world, saying: You must [[#^note-41a|repent]] and be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ; ^verse-41

**42**  For all men must repent and be baptized, and not only men, but women, and [[#^note-42a|children]] who have arrived at the years of [[#^note-42b|accountability]]. ^verse-42

**43**  And now, after that you have received this, you must keep my [[#^note-43a|commandments]] in all things; ^verse-43

**44**  And by your hands I will work a [[#^note-44a|marvelous work]] among the children of men, unto the [[#^note-44b|convincing]] of many of their sins, that they may come unto repentance, and that they may come unto the kingdom of my Father. ^verse-44

**45**  Wherefore, the blessings which I give unto you are [[#^note-45a|above]] all things. ^verse-45

**46**  And after that you have received this, if you [[#^note-46a|keep]] not my commandments you cannot be saved in the kingdom of my Father. ^verse-46

**47**  Behold, I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, and your [[#^note-47a|Redeemer]], by the [[#^note-47b|power]] of my Spirit have spoken it. Amen. ^verse-47
