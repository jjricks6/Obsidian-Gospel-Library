*1-2, How men may become the sons of God; 3-7, Sidney Rigdon is called to baptize and to confer the Holy Ghost; 8-12, Signs and miracles are wrought by faith; 13-16, The Lord's servants will thresh the nations by the power of the Spirit; 17-19, Joseph Smith holds the keys of the mysteries; 20-21, The elect will abide the day of the Lord's coming; 22-27, Israel will be saved.*

**1**  Listen to the voice of the [[#^note-1a|Lord]] your God, even [[#^note-1b|Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, whose [[#^note-1c|course]] is one [[#^note-1d|eternal]] round, the [[#^note-1e|same]] today as yesterday, and forever. ^verse-1

**2**  I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was [[#^note-2a|crucified]] for the sins of the world, even as many as will [[#^note-2b|believe]] on my name, that they may become the [[#^note-2c|sons]] of God, even [[#^note-2d|one]] in [[#^note-2e|me]] as I am [[#^note-2f|one]] in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I have [[#^note-3a|heard]] thy prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work. ^verse-3

**4**  Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as [[#^note-4a|John]], to prepare the way before me, and before [[#^note-4b|Elijah]] which should come, and thou knewest it not. ^verse-4

**5**  Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but they [[#^note-5a|received not]] the Holy Ghost; ^verse-5

**6**  But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt [[#^note-6a|baptize]] by water, and they shall receive the [[#^note-6b|Holy Ghost]] by the laying on of the [[#^note-6c|hands]], even as the apostles of old. ^verse-6

**7**  And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land, even among the [[#^note-7a|Gentiles]], for their [[#^note-7b|folly]] and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people. ^verse-7

**8**  For I am God, and mine arm is not [[#^note-8a|shortened]]; and I will show [[#^note-8b|miracles]], [[#^note-8c|signs]], and wonders, unto all those who [[#^note-8d|believe]] on my name. ^verse-8

**9**  And whoso shall ask it in my name in [[#^note-9a|faith]], they shall [[#^note-9b|cast out]] [[#^note-9c|devils]]; they shall heal the [[#^note-9d|sick]]; they shall cause the blind to receive their [[#^note-9e|sight]], and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk. ^verse-9

**10**  And the time [[#^note-10a|speedily]] cometh that great things are to be shown forth unto the children of men; ^verse-10

**11**  But [[#^note-11a|without faith]] shall not anything be shown forth except [[#^note-11b|desolations]] upon [[#^note-11c|Babylon]], the same which has made [[#^note-11d|all]] nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her [[#^note-11e|fornication]]. ^verse-11

**12**  And there are [[#^note-12a|none]] that doeth good except those who are ready to [[#^note-12b|receive]] the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation. ^verse-12

**13**  Wherefore, I call upon the [[#^note-13a|weak]] things of the world, those who are [[#^note-13b|unlearned]] and despised, to thresh the [[#^note-13c|nations]] by the power of my [[#^note-13d|Spirit]]; ^verse-13

**14**  And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their [[#^note-14a|shield]] and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their [[#^note-14b|enemies]] shall be under their feet; and I will let [[#^note-14c|fall]] the [[#^note-14d|sword]] in their behalf, and by the [[#^note-14e|fire]] of mine indignation will I preserve them. ^verse-14

**15**  And the [[#^note-15a|poor]] and the [[#^note-15b|meek]] shall have the gospel preached unto them, and they shall be [[#^note-15c|looking]] forth for the time of my coming, for it is [[#^note-15d|nigh]] at hand— ^verse-15

**16**  And they shall learn the parable of the [[#^note-16a|fig tree]], for even now already summer is nigh. ^verse-16

**17**  And I have sent forth the [[#^note-17a|fulness]] of my gospel by the hand of my servant Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him; ^verse-17

**18**  And I have given unto him the [[#^note-18a|keys]] of the mystery of those things which have been [[#^note-18b|sealed]], even things which were from the [[#^note-18c|foundation]] of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he [[#^note-18d|abide]] in me, and if not, [[#^note-18e|another]] will I plant in his stead. ^verse-18

**19**  Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail not, and it shall be given by the [[#^note-19a|Comforter]], the [[#^note-19b|Holy Ghost]], that knoweth all things. ^verse-19

**20**  And a commandment I give unto thee—that thou shalt [[#^note-20a|write]] for him; and the [[#^note-20b|scriptures]] shall be given, even as they are in mine own bosom, to the salvation of mine own [[#^note-20c|elect]]; ^verse-20

**21**  For they will hear my [[#^note-21a|voice]], and shall [[#^note-21b|see]] me, and shall not be [[#^note-21c|asleep]], and shall [[#^note-21d|abide]] the day of my [[#^note-21e|coming]]; for they shall be [[#^note-21f|purified]], even as I am pure. ^verse-21

**22**  And now I say unto you, [[#^note-22a|tarry]] with him, and he shall journey with you; forsake him not, and surely these things shall be fulfilled. ^verse-22

**23**  And [[#^note-23a|inasmuch]] as ye do not write, behold, it shall be [[#^note-23b|given]] unto him to prophesy; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on [[#^note-23c|the holy prophets]] to prove his words, as they shall be given him. ^verse-23

**24**  [[#^note-24a|Keep]] all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to [[#^note-24b|shake]] for your [[#^note-24c|good]], and [[#^note-24d|Satan]] shall tremble and [[#^note-24e|Zion]] shall [[#^note-24f|rejoice]] upon the hills and [[#^note-24g|flourish]]; ^verse-24

**25**  And [[#^note-25a|Israel]] shall be [[#^note-25b|saved]] in mine own due time; and by the [[#^note-25c|keys]] which I have given shall they be led, and no more be confounded at all. ^verse-25

**26**  [[#^note-26a|Lift]] up your hearts and be glad, your [[#^note-26b|redemption]] draweth nigh. ^verse-26

**27**  Fear not, little [[#^note-27a|flock]], the [[#^note-27b|kingdom]] is yours until I [[#^note-27c|come]]. Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen. ^verse-27
