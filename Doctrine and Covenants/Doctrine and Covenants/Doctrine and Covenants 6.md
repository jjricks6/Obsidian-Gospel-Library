*1-6, Laborers in the Lord's field gain salvation; 7-13, There is no gift greater than the gift of salvation; 14-27, A witness of the truth comes by the power of the Spirit; 28-37, Look unto Christ, and do good continually.*

**1**  A great and [[#^note-1a|marvelous work]] is about to come forth unto the children of men. ^verse-1

**2**  Behold, I am God; give heed unto my [[#^note-2a|word]], which is quick and powerful, [[#^note-2b|sharper]] than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words. ^verse-2

**3**  Behold, the [[#^note-3a|field]] is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day [[#^note-3b|lasts]], that he may [[#^note-3c|treasure]] up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God. ^verse-3

**4**  Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is [[#^note-4a|called]] of God. ^verse-4

**5**  Therefore, if you will [[#^note-5a|ask]] of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you. ^verse-5

**6**  Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and [[#^note-6a|seek]] to bring forth and establish the cause of [[#^note-6b|Zion]]; ^verse-6

**7**  [[#^note-7a|Seek not]] for [[#^note-7b|riches]] but for [[#^note-7c|wisdom]], and behold, the [[#^note-7d|mysteries]] of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made [[#^note-7e|rich]]. Behold, he that hath [[#^note-7f|eternal life]] is rich. ^verse-7

**8**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you [[#^note-8a|desire]] of me so it shall be unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much [[#^note-8b|good]] in this generation. ^verse-8

**9**  Say nothing but [[#^note-9a|repentance]] unto this generation; keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be blessed. ^verse-9

**10**  Behold thou hast a [[#^note-10a|gift]], and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is [[#^note-10b|sacred]] and cometh from above— ^verse-10

**11**  And if thou wilt [[#^note-11a|inquire]], thou shalt know [[#^note-11b|mysteries]] which are great and marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy [[#^note-11c|gift]], that thou mayest find out mysteries, that thou mayest bring [[#^note-11d|many]] to the knowledge of the truth, yea, [[#^note-11e|convince]] them of the error of their ways. ^verse-11

**12**  Make not thy gift known unto any save it be those who are of thy faith. Trifle not with [[#^note-12a|sacred]] things. ^verse-12

**13**  If thou wilt do [[#^note-13a|good]], yea, and [[#^note-13b|hold]] out [[#^note-13c|faithful]] to the [[#^note-13d|end]], thou shalt be saved in the [[#^note-13e|kingdom]] of God, which is the greatest of all the [[#^note-13f|gifts]] of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of [[#^note-13g|salvation]]. ^verse-13

**14**  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast [[#^note-14a|inquired]] of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time. ^verse-14

**15**  Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy [[#^note-15a|mind]]; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been [[#^note-15b|enlightened]] by the [[#^note-15c|Spirit of truth]]; ^verse-15

**16**  Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that [[#^note-16a|knowest]] thy thoughts and the [[#^note-16b|intents]] of thy [[#^note-16c|heart]]. ^verse-16

**17**  I tell thee these things as a witness unto thee—that the words or the work which thou hast been writing are [[#^note-17a|true]]. ^verse-17

**18**  Therefore be diligent; [[#^note-18a|stand]] by my [[#^note-18b|servant]] Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake. ^verse-18

**19**  Admonish him in his faults, and also [[#^note-19a|receive]] admonition of him. [[#^note-19b|Be]] patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity. ^verse-19

**20**  Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore [[#^note-20a|treasure]] up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and [[#^note-20b|diligent]] in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my [[#^note-20c|love]]. ^verse-20

**21**  Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the [[#^note-21a|Son of God]]. I am the same that came unto mine [[#^note-21b|own]], and mine own received me not. I am the [[#^note-21c|light]] which shineth in [[#^note-21d|darkness]], and the darkness comprehendeth it not. ^verse-21

**22**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might [[#^note-22a|know]] concerning the truth of these things. ^verse-22

**23**  Did I not speak [[#^note-23a|peace]] to your mind concerning the matter? What greater [[#^note-23b|witness]] can you have than from God? ^verse-23

**24**  And now, behold, you have received a [[#^note-24a|witness]]; for if I have [[#^note-24b|told]] you things which no man knoweth have you not received a witness? ^verse-24

**25**  And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if you desire of me, to [[#^note-25a|translate]], even as my servant Joseph. ^verse-25

**26**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are [[#^note-26a|records]] which contain much of my gospel, which have been kept back because of the [[#^note-26b|wickedness]] of the people; ^verse-26

**27**  And now I command you, that if you have good desires—a desire to lay up [[#^note-27a|treasures]] for yourself in heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light, with your gift, those parts of my [[#^note-27b|scriptures]] which have been hidden because of iniquity. ^verse-27

**28**  And now, behold, I give unto you, and also unto my servant Joseph, the [[#^note-28a|keys]] of this gift, which shall bring to light this ministry; and in the mouth of two or three [[#^note-28b|witnesses]] shall every word be established. ^verse-28

**29**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they [[#^note-29a|reject]] my words, and this part of my gospel and ministry, blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto you than unto me. ^verse-29

**30**  And even if they [[#^note-30a|do]] unto you even as they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you shall [[#^note-30b|dwell]] with me in [[#^note-30c|glory]]. ^verse-30

**31**  But if they [[#^note-31a|reject]] not my words, which shall be established by the [[#^note-31b|testimony]] which shall be given, blessed are they, and then shall ye have joy in the fruit of your labors. ^verse-31

**32**  Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together in my name, as [[#^note-32a|touching]] [[#^note-32b|one]] thing, behold, there will I be in the [[#^note-32c|midst]] of them—even so am I in the [[#^note-32d|midst]] of you. ^verse-32

**33**  [[#^note-33a|Fear not]] to do [[#^note-33b|good]], my sons, for whatsoever ye [[#^note-33c|sow]], that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow [[#^note-33d|good]] ye shall also reap good for your [[#^note-33e|reward]]. ^verse-33

**34**  Therefore, fear not, little [[#^note-34a|flock]]; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are [[#^note-34b|built]] upon my rock, they cannot prevail. ^verse-34

**35**  Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and [[#^note-35a|sin]] no more; perform with soberness the work which I have commanded you. ^verse-35

**36**  [[#^note-36a|Look]] unto me in every [[#^note-36b|thought]]; [[#^note-36c|doubt]] not, fear not. ^verse-36

**37**  [[#^note-37a|Behold]] the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the [[#^note-37b|nails]] in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall [[#^note-37c|inherit]] the [[#^note-37d|kingdom]] of heaven. Amen. ^verse-37
